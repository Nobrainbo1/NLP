The tap is a great product! Access to Alexa in a grab and go format!,
doesn't seems to be some chinese crap... looks like it's the original one... works fine with my galaxy s4 and also with my tablet... 100% recommended...,
"I ordered two 32GB and two 64Gb versions of these memory cards (but I can write only one review per Amazon). Two 32GB cards went into a camera and a cell phone which only accept up to 32GB cards -- and one 64GB card went into my Samsung Galaxy S3 cell phone. The second 64GB card's a spare.The Galaxy S3 phone accepted the 64GB MicroSD card with no problems -- except for the fact that my Galaxy S3 only recognizes 59.7GB of the 64GB MicroSD card. I have no idea why it does that and why I lost over 5GB of an empty MicroSD card but I'm okay with that -- I guess. 60GB's is still plenty. The transfers of music, videos, and pictures between the phone's internal 16GB memory and the 64GB MicroSD card is wayyy faster than the old SanDisk 16GB MicroSD card that was in there. The same noticeably faster speeds between my desktop computer and the 64GB MicroSD card were also smile inspiring.As for the SanDisk MicroSD cards -- they work great and seem to operate pretty darn fast. They're definitely faster than the old 16GB SanDisk MicroSD cards I had installed in my camera and cell phone(s).Now -- as for the shipping -- dismal! I ordered two 32GB along with two 64GB MicroSD cards on August 21 during an Amazon Gold Box sale. According to the tracking feature they didn't even transmit the shipping info to the carrier (USPS) until August 31. All four were shipped together. I didn't receive them until September 6 -- a full 16 days after I ordered. A little over two weeks for four tiny items that were indicated on the Amazon page as being -- ""In Stock. Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"" -- at the time of purchase. They also shipped all four tiny MicroSD card packages in a way over-sized box which the USPS couldn't fit into the mailbox so I had to make a cross-town trip to the US Post Office and stand in a very long and slow moving line to pick up the box. They could have all four EASILY fit in one small envelope. Even a small padded envelope. I left packaging feedback on that already.This is the 3rd straight time that Amazon shipping was horrible over the last several months -- and that is why the 2-star rating. This is not the Amazon shipping that I remember.",
"I have one in 3 phones, 2 Samsung Galaxy Players (my kids) and 2 Tablets.  Can't go wrong with SanDisk - they've never failed me.",
"Major fan, didn't buy this because of protection, bought it cause it will blend in to my decor. It is not a skin, so it's not skin tight. Yes it's loose but how often will you grab it and move it. Me maybe once every year.",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
I use this in my surface RT to store movies etc for the kids and be sure that it wont be tampered with,
"So far it is working great. Fits under my Kayscase armor box perfectly. Some reviews complain about the adhesive but that remains to be seen so far for me, obviously hoping that will not be the case. The touch effect on my screen has not diminished one bit.",
"I am very happy this come very fast, good packed, I usually used but its fantastic so fast with my new cards",
Just dropped right into the phone with no proble.  Disk works great and give me plenty of room for storage.,
"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded. I've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that I'd expect any besides possible fading).",
"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more",
Perfect Just what I wanted! I get all my Micro SD cards from Amazon because SanDisk are the best and the best price is here.,
"This SanDisk Ultra Micro SDHC Memory Card is a great example of how technology has made our live's simpler, better and richer.  No prep necessary; just remove it from the packaging, and plug and play.  I use mine in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 as its external memory to hold all my music, pictures and videos, and it runs flawlessly.  I haven't had a chance to use the adapter yet, although I have devices that take it.  It's a nice addition, one I think should be standard these days with this type of technology.Price was very competitive, the packaging was excellent, and the product arrived sooner than expected.  Overall, I had a great experience with this purchase.  I usually go with the big names for electronics, and it's not let me down yet.  I highly recommend this product.",
"I bought this to put in my Olympus PEN E-PM1 camera which takes a standard SD card. Therefore it must go into the adapter to be put into the camera.  Unfortunately there is something touchy about this. Sometimes I turn the camera on and get a card error. Sometimes I can pop the card out and back in and it'll work. This past weekend I couldn't get it to work at all.  I'm guessing it's the camera. Or maybe the adapter?  When I plugged the card and adapter into my computer to copy the pictures off, it worked perfectly. So I'm not sure what the problem is. I make sure to always carry a spare ""normal"" SD card with my camera in case this one stops working.",
"Haven't experienced any problems, arrived really fast. It's a great price for the GB size and was compatible with my android os tablet. Well worth the price! I plus sandisk is a reputable brand I trust. Highly recommended!",
"I've had this a week now. I also have a Kindle Fire HD I have had for about a year, with the case on, the Fire HD is heavy. I love the HD, and never leave home with out it, but many times I wish I could just slip my books in my pocket and run. I go a lot of places on the run, take others places where I wait for them to shop or what ever, and there is not WiFi to play on my Fire HD. I just want to read. My reading time has come up from one book a year to 50 books a year, and now my reading will go up even more.This was the perfect answer. So feather light It is incredible. It is taking me a bit to not swipe the screen to turn a page, and get used to the lay out and use of the various buttons, but after an hour I had read the built in owners manual, learned the ins and outs of the buttons and had it set up. It connected to my WiFi instantly. The on screen key board has taken a bit to get used to but once you use it a few times you can do it pretty fast.I wondered how all my content, library of books would be transferred from my Fire HD, to this device. To my pleasant surprise after connecting to my Wi-Fi, the next time I looked at the home menu my entire library of over 300 books was there, archived. I just click a title and it down loads in seconds.I honestly can't tell the difference between the print on this and the print on my Fire HD. Pixel wise, my eyes can't differentiate a thing.I love the texture look of a page from a book look. The no glare is amazing. There are times and places I can't read or see the screen on my Fire HD, and this just runs circles around the reading in bright light. Yes!Read more",
We are unable to connect WIFI on this product. We have tried to follow the instructions to no avail. It is a useless and expensive item sitting on our table.,
I'm using this card in my Samsung camera and it works well capturing pictures fast even in continuous picture mode. The video capture is also unsurpassed with the 30MB/s capability. I have never been disappointed with a SanDisk card and this is no exception. Good quality!,
"Installed it in my Contour camera and it works just swell for taking 1080p HD video at 30FPS. Can't complain, can't say much more. Good stuff.",
My phone makes very high definition photos which makes a big size file. I do not transfer the files to the computer because I have plenty of space. Also it works faster than ever.,
I so wanted this to work but discovered when it was in transit that the Razor Maxx HD only supported a 16 GB micro card.  So I ordered the 16 and am totally happy.  I am tempted to by this 64gb again and give it a whirl.,
this card works fine with my huawei. my phone recognized it and loaded it with problems. i'm satisfied with this purchase.,
Bought this to use in our Go Pro White edition and it has worked well. No issues recording time lapse or 15 minutes of video at one time.,
"The 32gb holds alot and when they say that this memory card is fast, they mean it. Holds everything I need on my android phone and works well with it. Had a few issues with the phone primarily but it was resolved when I reset the phone (note: The phone is an old Sony Xperia Ion Lt28a and has had issues from overuse so I needed to reset it regardless of the memory card). Once I finished setting up the phone and memory card from factory specs the devices worked like a charm. Still would not overrate it though so 3 like most of my other reviews.",
"I have a regular echo and now the tap. Both awesome products, use them to control lights, locks, and play music. Would buy again.",
The ability of something so small to hold so much information is somewhat overwhelming but true.I use this one in my DOD DashCam and it works great. Highly recommend to all.,
"Works fine, although videos seem to jerk a little in spots. I don't know if it's the phone or the card. But anyway, the capacity is huge, and music plays great and photos look fine.",
"I bought this as a gift for a co worker he went from 512 megs to 32 gigs what a difference. Although it will take him a while to fill it up, he still enjoys it compared to his old one.",
"Whether you just want the weather, latest sports scores or help with a math problem, Alexa will help. We now have 3 in the house and will be adding two more. With a simple 3 subscription to Amazon's music service, you can stream almost any music you can think of by simply asking Alexa for it!Perfect work with my meidong QQ Chocolate bluetooth speaker, I also recommend this speaker Meidong Universal Water Resistance QQChocolate Portable V4.0 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with 10W Dual Driver and Built-in MicrophoneAnd use this code for less 5: GHAQE5YF(I got it from somewhere else.)For the paranoid - this device is NOT for you. The echo dot is always listening and while the design is supposed to only listen when you say the name of the device (Alexa, Amazon or Echo - your choice), there are enough times that I hear one in another room say sorry, I did not understand the question to tell me it misunderstands these prompts to have been said when they weren't pretty often.+ Good product support+ Good voice recognition+ Because of the size it doesn't stand out like a sore thumb in a room- Doesn't differentiate between voices. If you keep it closer to a speaker than you are, then it will sometimes get confused and start picking up words from both the speaker and you when commands are given. Placement of dot is crucial for a good experience.- Only supports english and german for now- Not very competent at answering general questions and you need to activate skills to expand this functionality.Read more",
"Local storage is still a necessity (or a really nice-to-have) in this cloud-connected world.These cards (with and without the SD adapter) have been used in my mobile phones, DSLRs, computers (Lenovo Y500 and MS Surface Pro), tablets (Asus Transformer TF700, Nook HD+) and have been rock-solid.  I own 4 of them and in my DSLR they've proven to be fast enough for burst shooting and high-def video.In my mobile/tablet/PCs, they've been used to shuttle HD videos and other content back and forth without a hitch.Still love local storage and these cards are a relatively cheap and reliable way to achieve that.",
"I had problems using the chip in the reader built into my laptop. It seemed to only want to format up to 32Gb. When I plugged it into my phone, I could format at 64 Gb but then the laptop reader saw it as empty. When I used a USB reader, then the laptop could read it just fine.I was able to copy the 4Gb of data from my old microSD to this chip and have not had any problems with it yet.",
I use the extra space to put all my apps and podcasts on. I have yet to put music on it but I don't think it will be a problem.,
I know after I buy SanDisk I can be confident that I have a fast and reliable product. Has worked great in my netbook for a few minutes now,
"In this day and age of rectangles with screens being covered in various ways, its perplexing that you can mess up something as basic as this. It covers the Fire fine. The fit is snug and snaps into place no problem. A hidden magnet auto-wakes/sleeps the display when you open/close it. The fabric collects cat hair like a pair of cheap black pants. Yet worst of all is the fold on the back does an awful job of propping up fire when you want to use it hands free. You can get it to stay, but it often slides out, or just puts the fire at a slightly weird angle. Whether it's in portrait or landscape orientation, the stand on the back is so wonky, that you're better off just using a jar of peanut butter and a couple pieces of chewing gum to get it to stay in place.",
"I don't know about the read or write speeds, but the micro sd card seems to work fine with my galaxy s4 and I didn't have to reformat it.",
You do need to have  the right equipment to use as very few can access these.  Only newer and equipment that CLEARLY STATE can use these will work so be aware.,
I bought this memory for my Samsung Tab 2 8.0. So far it works quite well. I wish my Samsung would recognize the 64 GB.,
"I got my wife a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 for Christmas, and it took awhile for her to start figuring out all the things it can do.  Once she did, that led, of course, to her wanting to watch movies on it.  That was my signal to spring into action, that is, if I wanted to prevent her from running wild, buying ""digital copies"" of every movie we already have in DVD or Blu-Ray.  You can't play DVD or Blu-Ray movies on this device, but you CAN use your computer's DVD or Blu-Ray drive and commonplace third-party software to convert movies in this format into "".mp4"" and/or several other types of video files that CAN be played on this tablet.Since this particular tablet is capable of playing high-definition video (screen resolution is 1280 x 800 pixels), and we want to use ALL of that high-def capability, my conversion files tend to be pretty large (average 5 to 10GB per movie) ... way too big to be stored on the tablet's limited internal memory.  That's where the tablet's microSD slot ... and this SanDisk flash memory ... comes in.  I make HUGE mp4's, store them separately on a 1.5 terabyte drive, and then load as many of them as I can on this chip, which shows up in the tablet as a separate memory source.  Then all you have to do is pull up one of the movie files from the card, and hit play.  You can use the device's standard video player, or get an app with more controls.Watching high-def video on a tablet that's streaming the data from a memory card (rather than the tablet's internal memory) requires a memory card with very high ""read speed,"" and this SanDisk card's ""Class 10"" rating fills that bill.  That's the difference between cheaper microSD that's primarily designed for simple data storage, and microSD that's designed for higher active transfer/read speeds.  The ""Class 10"" designation generally means that the subject card will transfer data at a MINIMUM rate of 10MB per second.  This SanDisk ""Ultra"" card is capable of transferring data at speeds of up to 30MB per second, depending on the speed of the device you're using it in, and other particulars of the way you're using the device.""Frustration free packaging"" means the chip, SD adapter, and plastic case comes in a little, sealed cardboard envelope with a pull tab opener.  This card comes pre-formatted for Android, and my use of it in the Galaxy Tab 3 for watching high-def .mp4 movies has thus far been flawless.Finally, don't let yourself get burned by counterfeiters in trying to save a buck.  While pricing on memory tends to fluctuate, Amazon's current pricing on this card is VERY competitive with any/all vendors out there selling GENUINE SanDisk ""Ultra"" memory.  Buy from Amazon, or other trustworthy vendor, because I just learned the hard way that these memory cards are being counterfeited in huge numbers ... that is, the counterfeiters are placing SanDisk labeling/packaging on inferior, generic microSD, and selling the bogus chips on Ebay and anywhere else they can.  I bought THREE from Amazon after I got burned by a Chinese seller on Ebay.  The counterfeit packaging and labeling was good enough to fool me, until I actually tried one of the chips in the Galaxy Tab 3 ... the write speed (that is, the amount of time it takes to transfer files ONTO the microSD card) was dramatically worse than the speed of a genuine SanDisk ""Ultra"" card, and the read speed was totally inadequate for playing movies on the Galaxy Tab 3.  I may never have figured it out at all if I didn't already have one other, genuine SanDisk ""Ultra"" with which to compare the fakes.If you want the best, most reliable memory for the microSD slot on your shiny, new Android device, look no further ... this is it.",
Honestly I just don't care anymore. If this thing works as intended then I suppose its fast to me. Get it.,
Very protective case but highly over priced piece of molded foam.,
"Hi:I ordered two card and they arrived the next day, even faster than Prime. Unfortunatey, this 64gb MicroSD card is designed to only work with ex-fat. If you're an ex-fat fan and don't ever plan to change, this is the card for you. I've been able to take all of the previous 64gb MicroSD cards I've ordered, put them in an adapter and format them in my Windows 7 desktop. I'm a NTSF fan and find it to be much more stable in tablets.With other cards that aren't intentionally crippled, I can format the card to NTSF on Monday, ex-fat on Tuesday, Fat32 on Wednesday. It's ex-fat or the highway for SanDisk.You can use EaseUS Partition Master to format the card to Fat32 for devices such as cameras and mp3 players and many, many, many others that don't support ex-fat. That being said, you only get one shot. Once it's formatted into Fat32, attempting to format back to Exfat or NTSF hoses the card. I couldn't reformat to NTSF no matter what I tried. Once again, don't bother trying to format in your computer, ex-fat is the only choice.Any card that needs a special utility to format to anything other than ex-fat shouldn't be supported. Don't buy it! It's designed to fail.Shame on you Sandisk!Update 9/24/12:***************************I spoke with Sandisk technical support and they confirmed that Sandisk Ultra 64gb MicroSd cards are not compatible with Android 4.0 and above. This would be for Class 10, SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A as well as SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 30MB/s Memory Card with SD Adapter (NEW VERSION) - Retail Packaging with Komputerbay SDXC USB Reader.I did not have any success formatting the class 10 card with EaseUS Partition Master. SanDisk recommended the free utility, HPUSBDISK.exe and I successfully downloaded it from Softpedia. I was  unable to format the card with NTSF but successfully converted one of the cards to Fat32 for a friend who wants to use it in a SanDisk mp3 player, that of course is not compatible with ex-fat.Acting on Sandisk advice I am returning the unopened class ten cards with the KomputerBay reader. I spoke with a patient and gracious tier-one tech support person and the party line seems be that consumers only use MicroSD cards in phones. I don't know what they're thinking: cameras, mp3 players, tablets, adapters and so on. Anyway it's a known issue.I can confirm that the class 6  64gb MicroSD card can be formatted in Windows7 back and forth to most any format so after returning four class 10 cards, I'm back to class six.It's still unconscionable to deliberately design these cards to be incompatible. I hope SanDisk will come up with a solution or recall the cards. Buyer beware.Update: 9/29/12**********************I received my two replacement class 6, 64gb MicroSD cards and it took less than five minutes to open the horrible packaging and to perform a quick format to NTSF. Done!I gave my friend the Class 10 64gb MicroSD card formatted into Fat32 by HPUSBDISK.EXE and he couldn't read it on his computer. As it turns out, the class 10 cards are not only incompatible with most devices bur also with most usb card readers.  Another trip across town.I can confirm that the IOGEAR SD/MicroSD/MMC Card Reader/Writer GFR204SD (Green/Gray) selling on Amazon for $6.99 works. So after countless hours of wasted effort, my friend has a card formatted to Fat32 that works with a SanDisk mp3 player.Once again, SanDisk has admitted that these cards are not compatible with Androd 4.0 or above, that being 100% of Android tablets and a majority of Android phones. These cards are intentionally crippled by design.To quote a friend:""Per the SDHC standard, the format is FAT32. SDXC (64 GB and larger) the spec calls for exFAT. Microsoft has limited the OS to only format larger cards as exFAT and will not allow FAT32. Also, seems they have found a way to also block NTFS. Thus far, very few Android devices can read exFAT because they refuse to pay M$ for licensing of the exFAT file system. ""To all masochists out there--buy this card. To everyone else--unsafe at any speed.",
"What a DEAL............ I got this great tablet for a great price on Prime Day..... but was a little concerned it would be too big..to handle. but I was wrong.First I I was very surprised.. by several things about the Fire 10 that made me SMILE:......1) even though it is large in size the weight is LIGHT so it is much easier to handle than expected ( esp since my fire HD 8.9 HEAVY unit )).......2.) it does several things I wasn't expecting.. One is it has SCREEN MIRRORING... that means you can see your tablets screen on you great BIG TV screen. if you choose for games or what ever. 3. ) Smooth and FAST .. due to the nice processor.......4. ) WHOO HOO.. Google Play store can be easily added without disrupting you Amazon experience ( look it up on youtube))( it took less than 4 minutes and it was Up and RUNNING ))....... 5.) I think the Screen is Beautiful............ ( cannot imagine what others are seeing but this screen looks Great to me) 6.) FINALLY they put the speakers in the FRONT so it is much easier to hear you shows or music etc 7.) I think this is My FAV............I put in a great big 125g sd card and I am loaded to download anything I choose... loads of Movie from the A Amazon Prime Movies,..................ALL of my audio books from Audible.................and a huge amt of my Kindle Books...........I am delighted....... and should get several years out of this tablet in its present format..........ESP. now that google PLAY STORE is on it .Happy Happy Happy......",
I bought this to upgrade the 32GB MicroSD that was in my Samsung Galaxy S5. This works great!I recommend this for everyone.,
I have no complaints.  The micro SD is very fast and fits nicely into the adapter as well.  Great buy.,
"Bought this to use in my Samsung SIII as it was supposed to be a fast card. Worked fine until it totally died after less than a year of very little us due to the design of the SIII. Phone popped up a message that the SD card had been removed (it hadn't). Nothing I did to the phone brought the card back up. Removed it and tried it in my laptop (Win7) and other computer (XP Pro) and it is totally dead, neither will even recognize its in the drive. Working with Sandisk to get a replacement, they want all kinds of fairly useless information, will see if I get an RMA number and replacement card.This is the first memory card I have ever had fail.As an update, warranty service from Sandisk has proven to be non-existent. They first asked to have over 16 questions answered, then mysteriously lost all the answers I sent back, three times.",
good price for a 64gb card. purchased it to go along with the Hero3 camera. Just what I needed to complete the set,
I love my tap. It sounds great and is so easy to use.,
"Initially I gave the Echo Show a 3 star rating. In all fairness after about 20 days of use I've decided to change my score and here's why. First off Amazon reached out to me requesting feed back and advice. I appreciate the concern and their attempts to improve the device. I've also noticed quite a few updates in the short time I've had my Show and honestly things are changing for the better. I've been updating my review and will continue to do so as I've noticed updates and get more hands on experience. After separating my expectations from the actual capabilities of this device I've come to the conclusion that the Show still had me wanting more despite it's capabilities. I currently own the original echo which is in my living room, a dot in my bedroom, and one at work. I have lights, fans, a thermostat, surround sound, and TV all connected to my Alexa devices. Of course I had to buy one with a screen. I'm a big fan of Alexa, the products have become a routine part of my day. As soon as the Show was available to preorder I ordered one without any hesitation.Initially I wanted to put my show on a 70 inch TV stand by my 60 inch TV where my original Echo was. I figured it wouldn't look bad because I could use it as a digital picture frame also. I don't have end tables and quickly came to the realization that viewing a 7 inch screen from 8 feet away wasn't going to work for me. My Show now sits on my kitchen counter. I figured I'd get more use out of it in my living room because most of my Alexa enabled devices are in there and generally I spend more time in my living room than the kitchen. A few people mentioned why don't you put it on your desk.Read more",
"While this case fits a 7th Gen Fire perfectly, there is no comfortable way to hold it and it doesn't stand up on it's own for viewing. Returning to try another style",
Plays all my iPod music via Bluetooth. Also plays radio stations you can't get on a regular radio. Very practical and fun.,
"When I bought this a year ago, I had problems with it working properly in my Sprint E4GT (Galaxy SII).  The card kept waking up the phone to be read, over and over.  SanDisk acknowledged this problem in &#34;some&#34; android devices and shipped me a new card once I returned this one to them.  The new card still had the same problem, so I gave up.  The card is fast, and I got a good deal on the price, so I am pretty disappointed about it.",
I bought this to change my nook to android and boot off it. It's fast and reliable for daily use.,
I've had Kindle Fire's since day one and this is the only version that has slightly let me down. I'm having charging issues on a regular basis and occasional odd colors on the display. Also battery life isn't nearly what I expected. If the charging issues continue I will put in for a warranty replacement.....,
I bought this to increase the music capacity of my MP3 player.  As a bonus I can use the adapter with my old 8 GB Micro in my digital camera.,
I have been looking for a 64GB memory card and I found one at our local electronics store but it was over $100.  I logged onto Amazon.com and found this at a great price.  Why pay more when you can come to Amazon and get it for less.,
Really you can't say anything bad about it. Does what it says. Super fast and great storage size for lots of movies and such.,
"First I would like to say that I am coming from using Google TV. Fire TV is a great device. The voice search is accurate at picking up what I say. My biggest problem with this device is also with the voice search. Coming from Google TV if you used the search feature if would look for it in more places. Lets say I am searching for the movie Gremlins. On Google TV it would look for it in Netflix, Amazon Instant, instant prime, Google play store, HBO Go, and you get the idea. This device for example will not check Netflix. So I must do a voice search to see if it is on Amazon, if not I must open lets say Netflix and use the up, down, left, right buttons and manually enter the letter to find out if it is on Netflix. That was the big issue for me. A small issue is the amount of apps. No HBO Go, Google play store, and others. I am not blaming amazon for this. It is an open system so HBO and others just need to make the apps for it. This devise is quick, and amazon items start up instantly, but not Netflix. Netflix must load first, but that is not a big deal. If you are wondering why I am switching from Google TV, it is because Google neglected it and it hasn't received updates in a long time. I think Google gave up on it.",
I like the Amazon Tap because it is portable. I have used it several times and it makes things a lot easier.,
I use this memory card with my GoPro Hero 3 Silver Camera. I have had no issues recording 1080p video with this memory card. It provides sufficient write speeds. I bought the 16gb version. I wish I would have bought the 32gb version as 1080p videos become large files quite fast.,
"This card is exactly what it seems to be. It's large, it's fast, and it's priced well. Not much more you could ask for.",
"This was a good deal for my wife's new Samsung galaxy III,..fit right in(I did remove the battery first,..and so far have had no issues with the chip.....does what it's supposed to.",
"Before purchasing this I had a SanDisk 16GB Class 2 microSDHC. Needless to say, I didn't see the need in purchasing one of these. Then I began to read how Class 10 cards really do process recordings faster and records pictures faster. I didn't believe it, so I put it to the test. Using it in my Samsung Galaxy sIII, I installed it and recorded videos, took pictures, and played music on it. I also downloaded PDFs for work and other documents to it. In every test, it was far faster than any other class, and you can tell a difference between the classes. To close, I would just say don't settle for a lower class because it's cheaper. Wait for these to go on sale (because you know as well as I do that they will) and purchase one then. There is no reason to get a card in a lower class.",
"UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more",
I wanted a fast 64 GB microSD card for my Evo LTE and this one fit the bill.  I grabbed it on sale and it's worked great without any issues.Speed benchmarks fall into the proper range for a class 10.,
"This is a nice storage device, works well and comes with a standard size sd card adapter. Worth purchasing.Austin",
The memory card is an excellent condition and work as described. Dependable and easy to use. An excellent choice for the enthusiast who requires more storage.,
This 32GB card is fast.  Great for storing video and music and whatever you need to do without worry.  It is plenty large and the price is very reasonable.,
This allows recording at the highest quality in my Canon camcorder whereas many others will not allow high quality recordings,
Not much to say other than it is as advertised and it works. I haven't the means to gauge the transfer speeds but I've experienced no lags or delays with the combination of this storage and my hardware (Galaxy Note II).The shipping was faster than anything I received recently.,
"Extremely happy with this memory card. Very fast, and have not had a problem since I bought it almost 6 months ago.",
This little piece of equipment is a great way to watch movies and TV series. It's so simple to use.,
"Class 10 has a cost... I am wondering today how we did manage with 500MB cards when a few minutes of shooting a 1080p video do take so much space... I calculated that I could be able to record no more than about 5 hours of 1080p movies with this 64GB micro SD...On the other hand, the micro card itself is so tiny!... About the size of one of my nails. Miniaturization has gone a long way...In any case, I did put this into my GoPro 3 Camera and it recognized and formatted it immediately. No issue at all...",
This little SD card is pretty amazing.  It is really fast and there was no issues when installing it.  It even came with an adapter so you can use it as a regular SD card.,
Nice to see name brand things that are cheaper then in the store.  I bought this either for my phone or tablet.  You never need to worry about running out of space.  The only downside to this is if you have big fingers this thing is small and hard to manipulate for it to go in the proper way and space.,
"I'm not sure what to expect from a product like this, over the short term, other than it doesn't fail and is a good price. It has worked well in my tablet without incident. I would buy this again.",
"The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more",
Got a defective memory card.  Showed only 1 GB instead of the 64 GB.  Returned it for a replacement and never got the replacement!  Got my money back and went to Walmart.,
Works fine. Always likes sandisk products. Fits in my Samsung digital camera (takes MicroSD) fine and works great.  Fast and reliable so far.,
A 32Gb micro mem card for the Samsung Galaxy S3 is a great addition to and S3 unit! Never a problem with his card and I can expect a long life out of this memory card too!,
"This new KFHD replaces last year's basic Kindle Fire. Although it has some cool new features, it lacks a camera, microphone, and HDMI port. For this reason, I'm glad I kept my 2012 model since it does have these 3 features! Here are my initial impressions of the 2013 Kindle Fire HD: I like the placement of the on/off volume buttons. Being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one. I never cared for the carousel (this is what you see when you turn your Kindle on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed), and now there's an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead, and the apps/books can be rearranged to your liking. I was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar (which is now being called home). I don't know why Amazon removed this option, and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel. But you can still bookmark your favorite web pages YouTube videos for easy access. When I play songs purchased from Amazon's MP 3 store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style. Nice feature, but it doesn't work on every song. This device has a cool new feature called Quick Switch, which allows us, when reading or using an app, to bring up recently accessed items with a swipe instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one.In terms of sound, I find it to be tinny and not as rich as it is on the original KFHD. But you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds. Ironically, music sounds muffled unless you hold the device in landscape mode with your hands covering the speakers. Holding it this way projects the sound out to you.Read more",
"The only memory I use for most devices.  Have never had one fail, whether it be this microSDHC, compact flash, SD, flash drives, etc.  Great company.",
We love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen. Because of where we live AM reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Tap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through iHeart Radio and the Tap is portable.,
Purchased this for my GoPro HD Hero 3 Silver. It works extremely quick. No problems with recording videos or taking pictures on. I would buy it again.,
"There's a lot of counterfeits on these, and I apparently picked up a bum card from MemoryWhiz. My device shows me there's a 32gb of space there; it just is impossible to gain access to it. Rather, the /sdcard folder is found on my device's internal memory (the memory that came with the device). I even downloaded some apps that were supposed to read and write from my SDCard, but they work even when I unmount the card and remove it. So check out these cards thoroughly when you buy them and make sure they're what they say they are. Naturally, SanDisk isn't going to stand by a counterfeit.",
"What else does one need, right?And it does come with the adapter in case you want to use it on the SD slot. or put it into a flash drive adapter to use on your usd PC port.Great price here!!!",
I don't know why but I just needed some space. This provided me with the space to put all my extra stuff that does not physically exist...but it exists in the realm of awesome stuff. I have space now. It worked great. I have more memory now. oh joy.,
"Reading through the reviews I expected to have to jump through a hoop, or do something crazy special to make this work. The instructions say only up to 32gb is supported in my device.The card arrived. I chose the hassle free packaging... BEST CHOICE EVER! Inserted into the phone, booted up and chose format just in case on the card. The card formatted and I was presented with around 59gb free. Easiest ever. Very happy being able to start moving my music from the ever so aging iTunes to the card. The read and write speeds are more than acceptable, much faster than any of the other microsd cards that I have. I'm a very technical user, but would have felt very comfortable with talking my mother through such an easy procedure. I am going to assume it would work the same for the galaxy siii (S3).Not much more you can say about a boat ton of storage in a small container. 5 star!",
"This has some really fast speeds and has a good amount of storage. It's also almost as cheap as those bargain bin items that give out after a month or so of hard usage. This one didn't though. I'm pretty hard on flash, doing long sequential writes and what have you, and this guy just won't give up.",
"Works much Better than the 64GB version, at least in the GoPro Hero3 when shooting at higher frame rates. Sometimes the camera stops recording at high frame rates when recording to xFat",
"I love my Echo Tap! I have my own personal alarm, informs me on today's weather forcast and local events. Great purchase.",
Very nice product. The memory works perfectly and it is exactly what i was waiting for. I recommend it 100%,
Awesome product. Enjoy using it everyday. Would definitely recommend,
Perfect for HD video production. This will hold a lot of stills and videos with a reasonable write speed - No complaints...,
32gb of micro storage. Can fit tons of songs or movies on it as well as games which is nice for your phone or tablet. Also the fact that I got it for $24 is pretty awesome too. Thanks Amazon!,
"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more",
"FAST data transfer! This is the standard, the measuring stick for a great 32 GB micro SD card- you will not regret getting the brand name instead of getting the cheapos.",

"This is the fifth e-ink Kindle reader that I've bought. My wife and I were early adopters of Kindle, and when we buy a new Kindle, the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line. I loved the original Paperwhite, with its small size, touch screen, front-lighting, and virtual keyboard. The all-new Paperwhite is a definite step up, and for me, it was worth the move, but others will have to decide for themselves. If you read a lot, and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink Kindles, it's definitely worth upgrading to the Paperwhite. If you have the original Paperwhite, the upgrade is well worth considering. Although I've only had the new Paperwhite a few hours, I'm already glad I upgraded. Here's a summary of my initial impressions of the new Paperwhite.SIZE: It's the same size as the original Paperwhite - 6.7x4.6x0.36. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.8 ounces to 7.3 ounces. The Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand, which is how I usually read. The really good news is that if you have a case for the original Paperwhite, it will also fit the new one (thank you, Amazon). If you buy a case, I highly recommend that the case include the magnetic AutoWake function. It's much easier to turn the Kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch.LIGHTING: The front-lighting is noticeably improved over the original Paperwhite, which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the LED lights were located. (It didn't bother me, but some readers were annoyed by that.) I couldn't see any shadows in the new Paperwhite, where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform. With the Paperwhite's front lighting, you'll never need a clip-on light, even in total darkness.Read more",
"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded. I've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that I'd expect any besides possible fading).",
"This went into my Raspberry Pi, and it works great. I have had nothing but success from this little guy. Also, it conveniently came with the SD adapter.",
Does what it is supposed to do.  What more can you say?  I have no reason to rate it lower than 5 stars for that purpose.,

"I love SanDisk, and I have used quite a few of their products, including an mp3 player, a couple of USB keys and even a micro SD card (class 4). I have never had any problems. After installing this card, however, I have seen it unmounting itself randomly to be detected again and automatically being mounted by my Galaxy S4 device. This happens several times a day, including when I am in the middle of watching a movie on the phone (this is the first week that I have had the card). This is unacceptable. Normally, I would have just asked for a replacement, but after doing some research online, I have found out that this seems to be a recurrent problem on many phone models and doesn't seem to be just ""a dud"", but a production issue. I have returned the card, and I am going to go with another brand instead.",
"I purchased this item for my Galaxy S3 and it works wonderful.  I have no problems pulling up information and downloading music, movies, and pic!",

"This is fun but would not buy again. Not very informative. Keeps say ""I do not understand your question. """,
Works great and price was not too bad either. Worked perfect with out having to format it. Transfer rate was fast when I loaded 20 movies and 9 GB of musice and 2 GB of pictures all at the same time.

"Over the years, I've tried a variety of cases for the various models of Kindle and Fire tablet that I've purchased from Amazon. While I've found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive, I found myself coming back to Amazon's own product when I purchased one of their new 8 Fire HD tablets, and I'm pleased with it.This is a very good quality cover, it fits well, and it provides support to the tablet both in landscape and portrait orientation. It's made of fabric on the outside, with a microfiber inner lining to protect the screen of the tablet when the cover is closed. It matches the color of the Fire tablet perfectly.My only hesitation in purchasing it was the price - the case all by itself is nearly half the price of the Fire tablet! But I suppose that says more about how cheap the tablet is, than how expensive the case is (kind of).Still, I decided to spend the money for this case. The tablet needs the protection and I know from experience that Amazon's cases are durable and will last for a long time (I've used my original Kindle Paperwhite - first generation model - with the Amazon leather case since it was first purchased).I'll post some photos of the cover to show how it is packaged and how it looks on the tablet. I'm very satisfied with it. Notice how the speakers are visible at the top of the tablet when it is propped up in landscape mode.",

However, in my Droid it definitely shows as 64gb (well 59 and change)So far the card is functioning as it should: I have  played music, looked at pictures, and watched a little bit of a movie, all stored on the card, and eveerything seems to be working iin blissful Droid perfection.",

I can't be repair after that, so it gets totally useless. You can tell the card is going to fail before it's too late because constantly the phone shows a notification indicating that the card was ejected and it needs to be mounted again. When this happens I strongly recommend you to backup your data and change the MicroSD card of your phone and use it in other device before it gets corrupted.",

"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
"Even though it says my review is for the 32gb version it's for the 64gb. Not sure why it says 32gb above.I received this card to use in my 2013 MacBook Air for extra storage. I liked that the speeds were up to 30 MB/s. I figured there would be a little bit of a fudge factor but not this much.While I can consistently get almost 45 MB/s read speeds, the write speeds were only around 10.5 MB/s.I guess you could average these together but I don't think that's really the point. :-)I didn't see a review that dealt with this specifically so hopefully this will help someone else out in the future.Update: Only now did I go back and read the tiny print that ""Write speeds may be slower"". Well, that is obvious now but I think 1/4 of the speed is a lot slower.",

"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",

"Works great! Originally it had a delivery date of June-July, but it was updated and delivered within a week. Don't let the usually ship within 1 to 4 months stop you from getting it! Definitely easier than connecting my phone each time!",
"Got this MicroSDXC for my GoPro. I've got more than enough space not to worry about changing my simcard, but more about changing my battery.",
"I bought a similar one to this a little while back for a digital camera, I think I should've gotten this one instead. I believe it's faster (I think mine was Class 4 for the same price). For the money I feel I have all the memory I'll ever need for my smart phone, same for my HD video camera.",
"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more",
This product provides me with a stable and compatible storage augmentation for my Android tablet.  A true asset to my needs,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
Was a really good price on Amazon. I will be using this card to expand the memory in a Garmin GPS unit.,
"There is a speed penalty if exfat is used as oppose to NTFS.Using ATTO and formatted as exfat:read speed = ~45MBswrite speed = ~15MBsUsing ATTO and formatted as NTFS:read speed = ~45MBswrite speed = ~17MBsWith exfat, the write speed actually fluctuates as the transfer size increases.  But using NTFS, the speed are consistent.Tested on Lenovo T530 using built in SD card reader.",
"I didn't realize what small memory I had on my old phone T-mobile My Touch 3G Slide! I mean the thing was so slow and not accepting downloading stuff anymore! I figured later than the memory might be small. Sure it was! I looked up for a SanDisk memory card on Amazon and ordered one! Was surprised it was much cheaper than I had seen in a store! Installed it in my phone, worked like a champ! I can still use my phone for different downloads with that much memory!",
"Best memory I have found for consistency and high speed. Ideal for any modern application, especially high definition video recording.",
I love this .. Great extra for my amazon echo .. Does everything it does but it's cordless .. Keeps charge for many days .. Push button to activate .. Wireless speaker also out of wifi .. Really cool !!,
"Purchased it for use on my Samsung Tab 2 as well as my Note 3.The msd card came with 3 possible formatting : NTFS / FAT /exFAT. The default is exFAT, and there seemed to be some comments saying that certain devices might not be able to read exFAT.Being the smart alec I am, i decided to format it to NTFS, assuming that my android devices will work with it. Tab2 was not able to read NTFS, and I had to reformat it back to FAT in order to get it work.Subsequently, I tried using those USB-SD card reader (those that looks like a tiny usb drive)and realised that apparently the SD card formatting is too new, and it simply will not register as 64GB, but can only read up to 32GB.Have not tried on Note 3 yet, but should work seeing that the technology is pretty on par.",
Best kindle so far.,
The memory card works well in both my LG Optimus L9 (YES!!) as well as my Galaxy Note 10.1 Tablet. The card worked native on the Note but I had to reformat it to work with my phone (reformatting on the phone itself). It has the correct capacity and seems the correct speed.,
Works perfect. No complaints. It's fast. That's why I bought it. It does what it says it's going to do,
"Best price I could find for a high quality Micro-SD for my Samsung S4 cell phone. Every store in the area charged crazy prices for lesser quality cards. Don't even think of buying any sort of card from your cell phone service provider. They are the worst ! Amazon all the way for cell phone accessories. Items like cases, screen protectors , Micro-SD memory cards.",
"This is an amazing memory chip card. At less than half the size of a regular postage stamp, this card fits my Garmin GPS and allows me to take oodles of photos along for viewing. AND, it comes with an adapter to allow using it in my PC with one of the many multi-card readers. 32 Gigabytes in such a tiny card and at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended.",
"Don't buy the ultra-cheap substitutes.  Some of them misstate their capacity.  I know that with SanDisk that I was going to get what I paid for.Sure enough, I did.  I use this in my phone to primarily hold music.  Transfer speeds have been more than acceptable and there have been no problems with file integrity.",
"This card was dead on arrival and did not work whatsoever. When copying files to it, the transfer speed was below 1MB/s and then when I would eject the card the contents I just transferred would be lost. The card refused to format, I got an error message that the lock was on when it was not. Definitely a dud. I exchanged for a Kingston card of the same size which worked and still works flawlessly.",
Great Speaker but I really don't need the features. I just need good sound and don't really use anything besides that,
It holds all the stuff I want on it so I don't have to put it up on cloud storage which isn't always reliable.,
There is nothing to really say but sandisk really does well with providing quality storage technology at an affordable price.,
"These are great. This is my second Paperwhite and second charger. Thinking about a third, fourth...because while putting fiction on one and non-fiction on other have been thinking how great to have a Kindle dedicated just to recipes, another to health books etc would be marvelous",
Has a fast response time.Your going to need to buy one of these eventually since smart phones are advancing and so are the tablets coming out.Slided it write into my phone and worked like a charm on the first try.Pictures and apps load really fast with no lag time.Love it so much im going for the 64gb and always class 10 for me.1 less thing to worry about.,
"yet, but I will be soon. New in case and I look forward to using it!  I don't know what else to say about it!",
"I am using this with my Dell Venue 8 pro 64GB, and it is actually as fast as the onboard flash based ssd.  I can write to it very quickly, an di can read from it even quicker.  I recommend this if you need some additional storage space.",
"Works like a charm.  I originally thought this was expensive and bought an off brand card, which ended up being junk.  I returned it, spent the extra $15 on this card and it is awesome.  I have it in a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 (SMT310), and watch movies, read books (pdf), and listen to music on it.  Since I travel a lot I will end up buying a couple of these, that way I won't even need to take a full size laptop with me.",
Amazon Tap is awesome! Very happy with the purchase!,
"Holds lots of video memory. Small, compact and convenience for travel. Due to the small size need to remember where you place it.",
I've purchased 3 of the 32gb cards now. One each for my Galaxy S3 and my wife's. Also one for her Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.The cards are super fast and there have been no problems. The one in my S3 has been in it since they came out last year no issues at all.I purchased a 16gb for our Roku2.You can't beat the quality and price.,
Bought this to go into my Galaxy Note II. My phone recognized it and started using it immediately and automatically.  Very happy with purchase and would recommend to anyone with a Galaxy Note II.,
Fast transfer rates and great storage at a great price! I love these little micro SD cards and use them in several different devices.,
Super fast and quick read/write which i'm using for my GoPro and Surface Pro.,
"Pros:small,compact32 gbHCcons:none so farThis unit does what any micro sd card should do and does it quickly.  I bought this for my son's android tablet for memory extension and he can run apps directly from the sd card with no problems.",
"Not going to go on a rant about apple, but sure glad other phones allow these TINY slots that quadruples the memory. I drop and dragged tons of my music to the SD card and Android just finds it automatically and adds it to your list of music.",
"I bought this to supplement my OTHER streaming devices. I already have a Sony Google TV, which supports the Amazon Prime Streaming and YouTube etc. It connects to my TV using the HDMI. AND I have an Android tablet that lets me connect through the HDMI to my TV.The reason I bought the FIRE TV was I was under the impression I could use it to download Apps, (which is sort of true), and the App I wanted to use was the Xfinity TV GO. I have it on my Android Tablet, but since it's wi-fi only, it suffers a lot from stutters and stops etc. So I figured since the FIRE TV connects to my CAT-5/LAN, I would have a faster connection.FIRST GRIPE - When I get the FIRE, first thing I tried to find was the Xfinity App. It wasn't on the FIRE's Menu at all. Then I got on Amazon's site, and found it on Amazon's App Store, but there's a great big RED X next to the app, saying It's not compatible - D R A TSECOND GRIPE. No matter what I've tried to do, I cannot figure out how to limit my browsing of movies and TV Shows to ONLY show Prime eligible content. On my SONY Goggle TV, the app that came with it lets me filter out the content so that only my Prime Membership Free Streaming shows up in my search results. IMHO, this a less than subtle method of forcing you to make a buying decision every time you look for content. I don't know which is worse, no filters or embedded advertising.THIRD GRIPE - The APP store is extremely limited. There's just a little over 100 apps available. Considering this is an Android device, and the Android Play Store probably has well over 10,000 apps.... that's very poor APP support.OH YES, Either I couldn't find it, or THERE IS NO WEB BROWSER.It seems that everyone that makes one of these devices, has their own little world that they support, and they try to block out every one else that could be competition. The end result is the Consumer ends up paying the penalty. AMAZON needs to wake up - Not everyone is in love with Amazon.Yes, for a first timer, The Fire is a reasonably slick device to own, but I simply can't see the point in keeping the FIRE. It's so extremely limited as compared to a REAL Android device, and everything it does is already duplicated on one of my OTHER devices.I am sending it back for a refund.",
"Great fast storage. Works great as my Galaxy S4 storage card. You can always rely on sandisk products. Pay a little more sometimes, but worth it.",
"Found these for a really good price.  Bought 2, one for my wife and myself for our Galaxy Note 2 phones.  Hers worked fine but I did have an issue right from the start.  However, luckily it was right from the start because I had almost nothing on it so I reformatted in the Galaxy Note 2 and it has worked fine ever since.  It is recommended not to format it on the computer so I formatted it with the phone.  It works good as for now.",
Loaded songs for my bluetooth headset and it sounds great.  No issues so far.,
"Simply put, I now have 59.48 GB of extra storage space in my Samsung SGH-1717.  I did not think it was possible because Samsung recommends using a 32GB microsd on this phone.  I tried to re-format this card using my phone just like what the other reviewers mentioned, but, it didn't work.  My phone kept recognizing the microsd card as blank.  However, after using EaseUS Partition Master Home Edition that I downloaded on my PC (yeah, it's free) to convert to FAT32 , it finally worked!",
"I'm a long time Kindle user, and have upgraded a number of times. Every upgrade was a significant improvement, and the Oasis continues that trend. I love my Voyage, but the Oasis makes it feel like a hardback book. The pictures and descriptions don't do the size and weight justice. Shockingly light, and small even with the case. Used without the case, it's like holding a few sheets of paper. Amazing. Haven't had it long enough to evaluate the battery life, but never had a problem with the previous models, so I assume the promise of much longer battery life (with the secondary battery in the case) is accurate.The balance in the hand without the case is stunningly good. With the case feels a bit like the Voyage (although quite a bit lighter than my Voyage in its case). Case is high quality and easy to put on and take off as needed. Screen seems a smidge clearer and higher definition than my Voyage (maybe due to the updated lighting system).I had the 'pressure sensitive' page turner option on my Voyage turned off. Much too jumpy and sensitive, even at its 'hard' setting. I won't miss that. The new mechanical buttons on the Oasis are AWESOME. Nice upgrade there, and nice to not have to touch the screen for the most part.Yes, it is pricey. I would say if you are a 'few hour a week' reader, the Paperwhite is your best bet (solid performance and very good price/value). But if you are a reading fanatic who reads a lot every day (like me!), the extra battery life and the balance/size/weight, along with the slightly improved screen is WELL worth the money, especially when spread over the life of the unit.Edit: A few more comments now that I've been using the Oasis for a number of months.Read more",
This was a gift had no plan to purchase one. But very pleased with the portability and the sound quality,
No problems in my Note 2.  Slid what I wanted from the original 16 GB card on to this and couldn't even tell anything had changed. I mean that in a good way.,
"I use this for many technological devices and it works like a charm.I ACTUALLY DO GET CLASS 10 SPEED ABOUT 99.8 OF THE TIMES LITERALLY..................THE OTHER .2 IS PROBABLY RELATED TO READ/WRITE SPEED.........and let me remind you as I said earlier.MANY PLATFORMS FROM TABLETS,SAMSUNG GALAXY S3,S4,CAMERAS,PC,ECT..............WORKS LIKE A CHARM GOOD JOB SANDISK!!!!!!!!!YOU DID NOT LET ME DOWN..........",
Works perfectly in my GoPRo HERO3. Can't ask for more for the price. No issues with the card to date.,
"I put this in my hp envy x2 to extend storage, stays inside unit all the time. Works as a hard drive. It works as advertised",
"I purchased this for my Dell Venue 11 Pro, which effectively doubled it's storage capacity. Installation was simple and the card has worked flawlessly since I installed it. Great price, great performance, no headaches. Been going for a couple months now with no issues.",
Great price for 32gb SD card; It was delivered on time and I got it download from my previous SC card with out any problems. Great shopping for electronic stuff at Amazon.,
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
"This is my first SanDisk card, I have a bunch of other brands.  I use this one in a tablet.  It works great!  Really love the lifetime warranty that's included. So far so good!",
A great looking cover for the Echo Dot. It gives the Dot a softer and more elegant look. I feel that it is a little pricy for what you get but I do not regret my decision to buy this case.,
"32 GB Micro SD chip. If this is the size and memory amount you desire, this memory card has never failed or had errors on me. 5 stars for that and being the cheapest I could get at the time.",
"I like it for using on my cell phone. If used on Camera, it is slower then the &#34;Extreme&#34; version.",
"I bought this card because I have several devices that use microSD cards, but not all of them are compatible with the newer and higher-capacity SDXC standard. For SDHC memory cards, 32GB is the largest size available under that technology standard, so I went with this one from Sandisk. That way I didn't have to worry about compatibility issues with any of my devices. I've used Sandisk memory products for a number of years along with many other brands, and I've always had good results from them. I'm happy to say that my experience with this card echoes that of 5,000+ other Amazon users; it's been rock steady, reliable with larger file transfers (several 2GB+ movies at a time), and performed as quickly as I'd hoped for a Class 10 card in regards to its read/write times.Aside from the existing reviews and my previous experiences with Sandisk products, I also picked up this particular card due to its UHS-1 compliance. I don't currently have any UHS-1 devices that can take advantage of the increased speed, but for the negligible cost difference, it just made sense. Standards and technology update so fast these days; any future-proofing a product can provide to extend its usable life is always appreciated.",
This works with my Galaxy S4 and is fast enough to record 1080P video. I would purchase again I have always had good luck with SanDisk cards.,
Came too late in the ski season but will be mounting it on my bike helmet this Summer and then again when the ski season starts on my ski helmet.,
This is a great addition to a tablet. I store and watch movies on it as well as music and pictures. It does everything it says it does in its description and i have had it for about a year with no issues at all. I cant really think of anything bad to mention at all except that its so much memory in much a small package it could be the easiest way to loose nearly 100 movies in a washing machine and not even notice.,
"It's a 128GB microSD card, so there isn't much to say about it.  Make sure you check that the device you'd like to use this with can handle this much space.  It comes with an SD adapter, so if you have an SD port on your computer you can use it there.  Happily have this plugged into my Galaxy S5.Pros:- Lots of space- Durable little buggerCons:- Price per GB ratio is bad (but considering the tech this is probably as good as it'll get for a while)",
"Overall I was a little skeptical because this wasn't the product I wanted. Turns out, it's amazing!",
Great sound quality from such a small item. Easy to hide so it's not noticeable.,
"As has been the case for years, Amazon sloooowwwwly adds new changes and features to the Kindle. This one is no exception. If you've used a Kindle in the past, you're not going to notice much of a change with this one, but since there are some minor upgrades and so forth, I'll briefly go over them:*** SCREEN ***The new Kindle is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish with the slightly gray/off-white paper looking background. It's certainly not bright white, but it's also not LCD looking (dark gray.) It does NOT have buttons for page-turning as the older generations do. If you simply must have the page-turning buttons, please search for the older Kindles that offer that. One last thing regarding the screen: this is not a Kindle PaperWhite or Voyage where you have a back-lit screen... this has an unlit, off-white Kindle screen. I will say, the text is noticeably crisper and bolder than I've seen with previous generation Kindles and I believe that's because Amazon is using E-Ink's new Carta displays instead of the previously used Pearl displays. I love that and have been waiting for years for E-Ink, the Taiwan based company that makes the Kindle screens for Amazon, to improve them. It looks like they're finally getting it!The new Kindle's screen resolution is 167 ppi which is slightly lower than the Kindle PaperWhite which is 212 ppi, and substantially lower than the Kindle Voyage which boasts an impressive 300 ppi (individual pixels at this density can not be distinguished by the naked eye.) Price-wise though, the base model PaperWhite runs 99 at the time of this review, and the Voyage base model runs 199 so you can see, the more you pay, the better the resolution and features. 167 ppi is fine though...Read more",
"You'll pay $10 more for these anywhere else. I was initially leery of buying another SD card on amazon. 4 years ago I did so, and the card was a fake (said it had 32 gigs when plugged into the computer, but you could only load about 11 onto it, and it would say &#34;full.&#34; Apparently there's a way to fool your computer into thinking there's more space than there is, and this is what the fake/counterfeit cards will do).Not so with this one. It's the real deal, genuine SanDisk, and contains as many GB as it says it does. I'm a very pleased customer.",
"The advertisement calls this card a ""class 10"" card however I was not able to get ""class 10"" speeds with this card. SD cards seem to be MUCH faster at read/write then microSD cards. I get about 10MB/s write speed when copying a file to my SD card through my phone USB cable. I get the same transfer rate when in an adapter. These small memory cards seem to be very limited on their write speed. Also, this card did heat up some when transferring to it for a long period of time continuously but not too bad...just warm. The read speeds seem to cap out at about 18MB/s but I did see 25MB/s on small files. One thing to note, and this may be by design for this particular card but, this card is super fast when transferring small files but slow at big files so you'll see slower write speeds the longer you write to it with larger files whereas smaller files zip along one at a time at that 10MB/s. I was getting 8.6MB/s when writing a 4.6GB movie file to this card. All in all, this is an excellent card and beyond worth the money for what you get. I love it for my EVO 4G LTE and my previous phone the EVO 4G. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it did not perform as advertised at 30MB/s. However, if you are thinking of getting this memory card for an Android phone and don't want to pay big bucks, this is your card. Stop reading and buy it, I'm glad I did.",
"I find this card seems to frequently stop working altogether and have to be reformatted, or simply re-seated. It's hard to know if this is the fault of the device I use it in (a cellphone), or the card itself, so I can't really hold that against it, but all I can say is that's been my experience with this card, and not others.",
"I bought this for my girfriend and she is happy with it, she is not very data demanding as I am, I bought the 64 bit Extreme model.It works fine, not even needed to format it.",
"It's hard to believe they can cram 32gigs of memory into a device this tiny and also get good speed out of file transfers to and from it.  It's a good thing it comes with an adapter for larger size devices--I recommend keeping it in that adapter at all times unless it's inside something like a cell phone which only takes the MicroSD size.  It's way too easy to lose something this small.  I hate the industry's mad rush to make everything smaller and smaller with no regard to usability.  Anyway, the memory card is great outside of that, and since my phone does take MicroSD, I just keep it plugged in at all times and don't have to worry about it.",
I don't have any complaints about this Micro SD Card. I ordered it for my Sony Action Camera and its so far been doing extreamly well.,
"I have had cheaper SD Cards in the past, but they almost always wound up letting me down. I made up my mind some time ago that I would stick with SanDisk and have been completely satisfied with all my cards from them ever since. This card sits in my wife's phone and is used to store all her music and pictures. It has been in & out close to a dozen times (because I like to fiddle with stuff) and as proven very durable.In case anyone wants to know, &#34;Class 10&#34; is the only way to go with these cards (until they come out with something faster), the read/write speed is well worth the few extra bucks for my needs.I also have a &#34;Class 10&#34; 64 GB in my Galaxy SIII and it's as good or better. I even got it wet (I mean soaked) and it is still working like a charm.I will definitely recommend this to anyone, and will be sticking with SanDisk for all my other devices.",
"I love this storage unit. I would buy again definitely. Great for pix, videos, docs, or whatever you want to store. I have  it in my ME173x.",
"Bought this for my Raspberry Pi. Works great, it's fast and reasonably priced, and I have not experienced any issues with it yet.",
I bought this memory card for my Samsung Note 10.1. i amis really happy about it and i am recommending this product & am very pleased about it.,
I read all of the reviews of If you have the Fire HDX 8.9 don't buy this 10.1 tablet. The resolution is just as good on the 10.1 as the HDX. Starts up faster that the HDX. It's a nice size not a solid square like the IPAD'S. I saved myself 80.00 by buy the refurbished there is nothing wrong with it. I highly recommend this Kindle over than a high priced IPAD.,
Worked for awhile and then android would blow chunks (unexpectedly removed).  Windows sometimes could not read them and just blew up explorer.  Formated FAT32 .... ect ect ect over and over.  I'm done with SanDisk.  I think the problem is the CLASS 10 part of these cards.  All other cards I have work fine and they are less than class 10.  Maybe this was a bad batch because my replacement card a few days later (from Amazon) did the same thing again.EDIT: Decided to pick up the card that was laying on my counter for the last 3 months and give things another try.  Still does not work in HTC Evo LTE or EVO 3D.  Finally got it working in Galaxy S3.  Still very frustrating.,
WE use these in our phones to carry our favorite tunes or take lots of pictures.  They are excellent quality.,
"I have now owned 4 Kindles and just love them! My first one lasted for years and then died of old age and overuse. I had used it so much the printed keypads were all blank. I then got 2 Kindle Fires. I gave one to my daughter and kept the other. I have had no problem with the Fire once I broke down and read some of the direction, if all else fails. Other than operator error I have used it for over a year but it's too heavy for my old overused hands. Not heavy though. Books now give me problems. Even paperbacks. But I then bought the smaller, lighter new Kindle and loved it from the first. I carried in my purse a lot so it froze after a few months. I called customer support and they replaced it with a refurbished one. This time I bought a light weight cover for it. I don't like the added weight of the cover but in order for me to never leave home without it I have to protect it. I have had this one for months and have had no problems. I now have about 600 books awaiting my pleasure! I just looked the Kindles over again. I'm getting paranoid about my little Kindle and am considering having an on site backup although Amazon would get me one here in just a couple of days. Still giving it thought. Basically I love my Kindles and use both of my current ones for different apps.",
"While SanDisk's packaging makes much mention of Android phones and tablets, there's nothing Android-specific about this microSDHC card. I bought the 32GB version to use in an automotive ""dashcam"", where it works perfectly.The packaging also says that an Android app is ""included"", suggesting it is preinstalled on the card, but the (very!) fine print on the back says you have to download it. Unlike another SanDisk flash product I got recently, there was no ""bloatware"" preinstalled on the card.I like that this card is also said to be resistant to temperature extremes, important to me as it will be behind a car windshield and will get hot at times.",
The sound out of this little cylinder is incredible.,
I really enjoy it love the sound and it's really easy,
"I believe in generic. I tried generic. for somethings, you need SanDisk. you can trust SanDisk, it always works and if it doesn't, they will make it right.",
bought it for my Galaxy Note 10.1 and worked since day one. Easy to use in multiple devices for transferring files also.,
"Well i do try to take alot of pictures and with this card it does the job for me, i would recommend this to even my enemies really good product especially when they go on sale on amazon....Package kinda two big for this little thing, but i will work with that little problem.",
This is a solid card that I use in my GoPro. It holds the data and the read write speeds are impressive.,
Its amazing the amount of storage we are putting in micro chips these days.  I use this for my dive camera taking videos and pictures.  The chip hasn't let me down yet and no errors.,
Work good,
"what can I say besides what the title says, Plenty of memory....plug and play and a GREAT price...you won't be sorry!!!  :)",
"I bought his card in November 2012 and it just died. Fortunately, I had backed up the files but for what I paid, I am dissappointed. No more SanDisk products for me.Update: I realized that the reason this wasn't working was because I had an AOSP rom on my Note 2. When I went back to Touch Wiz, it could be recognized again. I've changed my rating from 1 to 5 stars; it is working great.",
"Overall good, not great. I get tired of having to push the button to talk to her and she can't find a lot of the music I liked. Am getting some Dots to see how they will work. For price point it works.",
"Purchased this as a memory addition for the Surface. Great way to add all files for a meeting, so the laptop can stay behind. This card is fast enough so you can access files quick. Great Product.",
"Hard to say much about a memory card other than it works as expected, since it's class 10 it's fast, since it's 32GB is has plenty of space for music, pictures, and videos.",
"Hey, it's memory. Everybody needs it, and you can never have enough.And, as I'm always losing my memory, I have to keep plenty on hand and stashed away for a rainy day.",
I love this Micro SD Card. I'm glad I bought it and I use it for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I have never gotten any errors with it so far or failures.,
"I've had the SD card for over 6 months, and use it in my Galaxy S4.  It has never had any issues, it transfers data pretty quickly and 32GB is a good amount of space.  Great price too!",
"I have Only Filled this one time, and that was over 140 pictures @1080, and 4 videos to boot...This Holds Plenty of Pictures",
"Memory Card works fine, no problems.  I have a number of SanDisk Memory Cards, and I've never had any problems with them.",
This is what I needed for my tablet and it works great. I will buy two the next time. thank you .,
"In the past, I've bought lots of CF and SD cards and USB keys. Years ago, I bought brands randomly until I had a failure with a particularly high-priced brand. At the time, these critters were tres chere, so I decided to standardize on WD because I'd never had a failure (except for hard drives, but that's a different topic).Now that the price per gig is less than I used to pay per meg, I still stick with WD because I'm using these cards over long periods of time and don't want to lose the data.I recognize that this is anecdotal and may or may not be in line with what Consumer Reports says or others' experience, but by now, I'm a mindless fan and frequently chant ""Roll WiDe.""Now, if only they would get rid of the anti-shoplifting packaging . . . .",
I gave away my last card to a friend who needed one.  After reading the reviews for this card I purchased it.  I seems quick enough for my needs and plenty of space.  I've never had a problem with SanDisk.  My go to company for all my Disk needs.,
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
"Works great, my phone detected and let me format it to FAT32 with no additional tools. Once formatted its 59GB (you lose some in the conversion metric from GiB to GB. Bought it for my Motorola Droid X first generation phone, I wanted to use it as a media player and it works wonderfully and has lots of storage for my movies, music, games and books. Its a class 10 card so its also very fast, certainly faster than the stock card.",
I haven't figured it out yet. So far it seems ok but I haven't used all of its potential yet.,
"Review updated September 17, 2015As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing this review from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the 2013, 2014 and new 2015 Paperwhite, the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9. This review is for the 2015 All-New Kindle Paperwhite. The attached picture shows the 2014 Kindle on the left and the new 2015 Kindle on the right. Here is the summary of my initial impressions of the 2015 model versus the 2014 model.I am somewhat disappointed in the 2015 version as there is not a huge improvement over last years model. The Paperwhite made many improvements from its original first generation 2012 model to its second generation 2013 model, especially in the display and processor area. The 2013 model came with 2 GB storage, a wonderful display, a great battery and was the e-book workhorse. The second generation 2014 model changed by only increasing storage to 4 GB. The third generation 2015 model increased the display resolution but reduced the battery life slightly.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: A Paperwhite device, a quick-start guide and a short USB cord. Amazon still does not supply a power adapter.SIZE: Its the same identical size as the older Paperwhites. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.3 to 7.2 ounces, a fraction of an ounce, most likely because of a smaller battery.The good news is that all cases that fit the other Paperwhites will fit the 2015 version!!DISPLAY: The resolution has been bumped up to 300 ppi, equivalent to the Voyage.Read more",
Works well for the Galaxy S3 and provides additional space for pictures and music. It was exactly what I expected it to be.,
"This is the fifth e-ink Kindle reader that I've bought. My wife and I were early adopters of Kindle, and when we buy a new Kindle, the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line. I loved the original Paperwhite, with its small size, touch screen, front-lighting, and virtual keyboard. The all-new Paperwhite is a definite step up, and for me, it was worth the move, but others will have to decide for themselves. If you read a lot, and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink Kindles, it's definitely worth upgrading to the Paperwhite. If you have the original Paperwhite, the upgrade is well worth considering. Although I've only had the new Paperwhite a few hours, I'm already glad I upgraded. Here's a summary of my initial impressions of the new Paperwhite.SIZE: It's the same size as the original Paperwhite - 6.7x4.6x0.36. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.8 ounces to 7.3 ounces. The Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand, which is how I usually read. The really good news is that if you have a case for the original Paperwhite, it will also fit the new one (thank you, Amazon). If you buy a case, I highly recommend that the case include the magnetic AutoWake function. It's much easier to turn the Kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch.LIGHTING: The front-lighting is noticeably improved over the original Paperwhite, which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the LED lights were located. (It didn't bother me, but some readers were annoyed by that.) I couldn't see any shadows in the new Paperwhite, where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform. With the Paperwhite's front lighting, you'll never need a clip-on light, even in total darkness.Read more",
"There is not much to say about a micro-SD card, but this one seems to work for me. word, word.",
Just what I needed for my Tablet. Recommend the product and getting one for my phone too. Fits my expectations.,
Bought this for use in my Canon 60D camera.  Works great with no lag.  haven't had a problem with it.,
"32GB worth of memory space, perfect if you love installing a variety of apps and it is useful when you need to store memory into your phone, camera, or tablet.",
"Have saved all the tablets photos, free apps and oodles of other stuff.  I don't see any way to ever use all of the memory.",
Bought this to use with Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (Verizon) and works wonderfully.  I did not need to reformat.  Just pop in and ready to use.  Didn't get the same speeds that the manufacturer says but more than I need to stream media from it.,
"Still working with no problems so far, so it seems to be reliable. Not sure what else to say, but they want more words.",
"There isn't much more to be said.. First, there is the Sandisk name, Sandisk quality and Sandisk speed. The packaging was done well and shipping was not an issue.  As a professional for both video and photography, I've never had a Sandisk product fail me.  This unit was purchased specifically for my GoPro Hero 3+ Black, but could just as easily work in my Canon 5D mk III (with an adapter) in one of its dual slots.",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
This product was formatted and installed in a GoPro Hero 3 Black. I get 4:30 hours of recording time on 1080p 60fps. No issues so far and don't expect any since SanDisk is basically the standard for solid state memory.,
"Be aware--if you want to use this device to record and play high-definition video with files greater than 4gb, you'll need to format the card as exFAT or NTFS (if you want to play the files on either a PC or a Mac. But it works well after properly formatting.",
"I saw the difference between this and another of 4gb that came with my digital camera, it's really faster than the other.Now I'm using it in my smartphone without any problems so far.",
This rating is based on multiple years of use of this memory card. Its reliable and easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a memory card for long term use.,
Was worried about some articles saying to use 2 X 32gb cards instead but this 64gb card worked out fine for me but was scared when the camera got real hot the first time around.,
"As usual, SanDisk does not disappoint. The speed is incredible, as is the price. Although you can get a variety of different manufacturers, none are as reliable as this one.",
A+ on product and seller- Came as described- shipping was very fast- I was excited to see how this class 10 was compared to other micro sd cards. I have it in my new galaxy s4- Pulls pictures videos quickly and stores them just as good. I have already recommended this to friends.,
"awesome large SD card for all mobile devices, enough room for all my music and even a few movies, buy it!!!",
"Ordered two of these and none works w my Cell Phone, Audio player or Camera.Guys, you have a problem......................................................................................",
"this is by far the very best sd i ever owned. it writes and read at crazy speeds. easy to use and connect to any device.im glad i bought it. plus is waterproof, shatterproof, freeze proof, g-force to break it is incredible.",
"Pretty much as stated above.  Write rate holds up well from small files to large files.  Reads vary from 25-33MB/sec but holds pretty steadily via card reader (in supplied SD adapter), through Motorola Photon Q, and through the SanDisk SDDR-121-A11M adapter via USB 2.0 and on either PC I have",
I'm hoping this one behaves as good as it is now for at least a year.ill Update if something goes wrong.Very fast.,
"Fast, great storage. We used this SD card for a new Samsung Galaxy S5. Works like a dream. Well formatted and fast. I would recommend this product to anyone who need a high gb sd card. The added on sd adapter is a nice plus and comes in handy for pc transfers.",
Thank you Amazon for showing me what type of Memory Card and Adapter that I needed. I love buying everything I need at once to use my electronics purchases.,
"I've officially expanded the memory in my Surface Pro 2 by 50%. How amazing is moderity? Literally, my entire life's work can be stored on a device smaller than my thumbnail. Great.",
This little microSDHC memory card from SanDisk is equal to their reputation. It is fast enough and large enough to store and stream full length movies that we've ripped from our own DVD collection. This is a perfect addition to our new smartphones. We bought three of these for our recently purchased smartphones.Highly recommended by me.,
So far so good. I bought a samsung micro sd card from bestbuy and it somehow erasedeverything. So this is my second one. Hopefully it keeps all of my stuff,
Works good.  What can I say about an SD card?  It stores my video files for my GoPro.  Nuff said,
"Writing for the person it was bought for. she loves Loves LOVES it. her life has become very limited and this has really helped. The fact that she can ask Alexa for the news or weather is just wonderful. And she loves scrabble and solitaire. They are a little difficult to navigate for her but she persists, and does it. It just takes her a lot longer. The voice app in the Fire Messenger is very difficult for her to manage, the button is so tiny, and crammed up against the other things, It would be nice if someone would make HC friendly apps.*Note to Amazon Fire Designers*I would ask that you convince DRAGON to make a version of their Voice to Text app for the Fire, THEN she could enjoy things like FB. As it is all she can do is look, typing is way too difficult.",
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
"This ""Ultra High Speed"" card is about half the speed of the Class 4 card I was using.  10MB/s Read and 6MB/s write is more than a little below where a device with this rating should perform.  I could believe if it was the same speed as my old card, maybe my brand new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7 doesn't have a UHS1 rated port, but to be half the speed of my Class 4 card, this ""UHS1"" thing clearly is penciled on by marketing monkeys and sold without any testing or quality control. I wish I knew how to rate with 0 stars.",
It's A good reliable product that I can always rely upon. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a micro sd.,
"This is a great personal speaker. I have both the Tap and the Echo. The only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically ""tap"" the mic button to activate Alexa. The sound quality is pretty good for the price. If you can afford it, I would upgrade to the Echo.",
"I was a bit skeptical about getting this card because the official instructions for this phone only mention that the external memory is expandable UP TO 32gb. I did a bit of research before purchasing & many reported being able to use this card with the EVO 4G LTE. I can confirm that it works!At first, the phone won't recognize the card. YOU NEED TO FORMAT THE CARD WHEN YOU FIRST INSTALL IT! once you format the card, the phone will recognize it & you can write & read data with no issues.I got such a large card because of music. I wanted to add music in .wav format for better audio quality (or at least in mp3 320kbs). I'm very happy with this card!",
This chip has done very well for my Samsung galaxy note 2. I would highly recommend getting this brand. I have had other brands to have failed and taking all of my data with it.,
Works great with the GoPro camera!I can get about 3 days of kayaking video and photos on it.Price was fair.,
"It has sleep timer capability alarm I use it at work, or use it at home while I'm in the shower and I'll bring it to Friends houses and we use Alexa to gain information or just have fun. quality a 9 its loud too.",
No brainer. This is not the regular 32 micro sd its the HIGH CAPACITY ULTRA...just go price this baby anywhere else and you'll see that AMAZON is the only place you should even think about buying this little powerhouse from. No brainer.,
"Using the included adaptor on my MacBook Pro to transfer files, I was impressed with the speed of this card.",
"I have this installed in my Samsung tablet that has 16gb.  All my music, lots of pictures and a number of apps are on it and work flawlessly.  Can't find anything wrong with it and the price was not bad either.  Love it!!",
What can I say. 64 GB in a microSD card. ~30mb/s transfer speed while inserted into my laptop. Works great in my S4. Can't really go wrong with this price either.,
"Don't know what exactly to say, but the little micro seems at least as efficient as any other micro that I've ever used.",
"I have the Echo and a Dot and now the Tap, too. My only issue with the Tap is that I got it after the Echo. This means that by the time I got the Tab, I was already used to just calling out commands or questions to my Echo. Of course with the Tap you have to physically get up and touch the Tap. I think if I had first started out with the Tap and having to touch it, it wouldn't be so difficult now for me remember to tap the Tap. But it is a habit to just call out now. So I wish I'd gotten the Tap first and then had graduated to the Echo. Try the Tap first. You might decide you don't even need an Echo. You definitely won't be disappointed !!",
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
"The Fire HD 8 seemed like a great deal to me considering the size, economical price point, and the ability to watch content offline. And it offered exactly that...but fell short on performance parameters. If you're price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet, larger screen than the 6 Fire, and the ability to watch content offline, this is a decent device to get. However, if you already have an earlier Kindle like the HDX 8.9 or even an earlier version of the Fire, I recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn't really be a worthwhile upgrade. I have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device. If you're looking for a very basic tablet to watch videos or for your kids, the 49.99 Fire is a better option.QUICK SUMMARY:PROs - Price, dual stereo speakers, expandable memory slot (great for viewing content offline), full access to Amazon content. Good basic tablet specially for watching videos.CONs - Screen resolution crisp but not great, lags quite a bit when switching or starting/closing apps (runs fine once an app is open), battery life is just ok, freezes quite often and the only solution is to reboot the device which becomes frustrating after a while.The device is basically slow to load apps, lags quite a bit when switching apps (this becomes worse as you load more content on the device), freezes quite often, and I find myself having to reboot it every now and then. A frustrating experience to say the least. The device is claimed to be Designed for Entertainment - true, but I would also add Not designed for performance.This is meant to be a basic value tablet giving you access to the Amazon ecosystem, and it is exactly that.Read more",
"Works like a dream with my S3 smartphone, used for camera pics storage, videos and music; really enhances the capability and flexibility of any device with the slot.",
"I ran several tests both on my computer, and my phone it wrote at 6MB and read at about 6 to 10 depeneding on its mood. I bought this to replace a generic 32GB class 10 card that I lost (so dang small i droped it and could not find it. that Card actual wrote at 11 to 12MB and read at 20MB. I went with sandisk because my phone came with a class 2 that performs more like a class 6. What a waste of time. Refunded this item",
"Using this card for my GoPro Hero 3 Black.  No issues to date.  Card was used to video vacation in Palau, Yap, & Guam - underwater video.  So far, no complaints!",
"I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.br /br /Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.br /br /One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed. It sometimes takes a while after you push next page' for it to actually change.Read more",
Had to return it because it only formats into certain formats and i needed ntfs which it would not do at the time.I did purchase this again in Oct 2013 and found it work as needed. So far it's working great.,
This was my first time adding an SD card to a Smart Phone. I just got a Nokia Lumia 1520 and with such an excellent screen I wanted to be able to play movies on it for trips or to watch at my desk while working.So far I have put 6 albums and 6 Hi Def movieson the card and still have 20gb to spare. Everything loads up just as fast as if it was stored on the phone's internal memory.Very happy with this little guy.,
"Bought this for my new Samsung Galaxy S4. Works great, no problems with transfer speed. No failures with it so far, so I would suggest this to anyone.",
I have a problem with the size of these mini cards --they are hard to hold on to  and get in and out of my drift cameras they get stuck all the time,
"I like it but the most used app is Netflix. This Netflix app version is older and a pain to use. Why they have this outdated one, doesn't make any sense.",
We ordered two of these for our Samsung Galaxy S3 phones. They work perfectly!  Exactly what we wanted and needed:),
"I've used many SanDisk memory cards over the years.  This one ranks way up there just like all the others.  I am using it in a Samsung Tablet and it does all I want it to do.  I cannot comment on speed, since that isn't an issue to me.  For storage this is quite the gem.  And I bought it &#34;pretty cheap&#34;.",
"I bought two as a back up for my Gopro Hero 3.One from Amazon the other was a gift from BB.Both did not work in my cameras, thinking it was Gopro's new update.Kept getting a SDERRI returned other and it worked with no problem.NOTE to all, there are boot-legged products out there It is hard todetect. But of all the Items I've received from Amazon/Prime and beyondHave been great. I just got stuck with a bad batch.GoPro recommends HX,HC,XC and extreme micro cards.",
"Used in new smart phone, seems to be working well so far. Three months on the clock. Time will tell re durability.",
SANDISK is a good brand for me and this just worked.  Cant really ask much more of it than that!,
Works great on my Galaxy S3.  I have not had any issues with it in about a year of ownership.,
"Class 10 SD cards are certified for certain high demanding applications like cameras. We use a pair of these in our HTC One cell phones, and have had fantastic luck with them.",
"Pro:  &#9642;PriceCons:  &#9642;intially began to get card read errors on Samsung Note.  Right at 6 months it fails, lossing all my data.  Pictures, videos, documents, ect...  all gone.I shouldn't have cheaped out, I should have bought the samsung card.",
"Very fast card in my SGS3.  Sandisk always makes quality cards.  I always get read/write speeds of at least 14MB/s and 22MB/s with this card (see my uploaded pic).  Card hasn't given me any problems.  Reliable, fast, great price.  A++!!!",
worked for me and at great Amazon price. In my Hero 2 GoPro's doing video's at least once or twice a week for over months.,
I used this card to replace the hard disk in my old laptop so I can use it to stream netflix. I installed linux Ubuntu on it. The card works great. It's very fast and is very reliable. I recommend it.,
"The card works in the above mentioned phones but I did have to format it using another program downloaded for Windows. Windows will not let you format the card for FAT32 which is the format you need to use for the phones to see the card. The also could not format the cards correctly on their own, but once I was able to format them properly, they worked perfectly.",
cant complain about anything sandisk.  I buy this product anytime I need a memory card.. prices are decent and storage capacity is as well,
Love being able to use Alexa unplugged. Amazing device!,
Replaced one that crapped out in my tablet - taking most of my apps and a few hours of my time with it.,
I purchased this card to work with my gopro and I have no complaints. I does not lag on 1080p 60fps or when I do a 10 photo burst. Great product and an even better price,
My local electronics store had no inventory for memory in Micro-SDHC format. Amazon fixed that problem.This came in quickly and was a breeze to install. It saved me $15 - and that was an added bonus.Now I can download all my music to my cell phone.Problem solved.,
Using the SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter... with my samsung tab 2 7.0 and it performs well.,
"Its probably better than I think it is. I got this to go in a Samsung tablet which is about to get replaced with an iPad. But the SD memory card portion has not given me any fits yet.

"I noticed within a week that some movies I had watched in the past on PRIME for FREE are NO longer on the Free list. And where did all the Chick-Flick movies go we have to pay for each thing now still deciding if this is getting returned or not. The equipment is awesome and set up was fast and so so easy, but I didn't purchase it to PAY for each and everything I want to watch. I love Amazon and shop all the time, but .... why take the movies off the FREE list for PRIME",
"I formatted the card, saved the data from phone's 4 gb card to desktop, dragged and dropped the files from 4gb to 32 gb card. Installed 32 gb card in phone. Phone works perfectly. Win win.And a great deal for the price.",
Memory card works awesome and for this much memory for the price is awesome. I use it for my GoPro but you can use it for anything that can take a micro SD. Comes with the bigger SD card so you can put it into a card reader or computer that reads SD cards.,
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
"As other reviewers I wish that the remote still came with the handy magnetic base like the first ones did. It does, at least, come with the battery still. Because I know the remote will disappear to a never been seen again realm without a home I have decided to swallow my irritation it doesn't come with a dock and buy one to use with it. From my research it looks like this is the best bet - TotalMount Fire TV Remote Holder. The Fire TV remote appears to be the exact dimensions of the Echo remote, so I'm hopeful this will be a great solution even though it irks me to spend another 10 on a solution for something that used to be included! **Update: I ordered the TotalMount Fire TV Remote holder and it works great with Echo Remote.**We have a few Alexa units in the house and aside from the original one that came with a remote I haven't felt the need to buy another remote. Unless you blast your music it is normally fairly simple to engage with Alexa (at least how we have our rooms setup) even without the remote. However, my 3 and 4 year old have recently become quite the Alexa fanboys - checking the time, asking for jokes, listening to their playlists we've set up.... one of them can articulate clearly and Alexa responds, and the other can not. Before frustration got to a crazy level I decided a remote for the unit they normally talk to was the key.They (and I) love that you don't have to say Alexa *just* right to get a response with the remote. You simply hold down the microphone button and start talking (no wake word needed). Happy campers now. The range is great, the Alexa unit connected with this remote is in the middle of the house upstairs and no problems with using the remote anywhere upstairs (about 2000 square), as well as from two floors down in the crawl space - tested simply to see if it would work, and it did! We use Alexa on a daily basis and the remote is a great tool to go with it.",
Works great in my Samsung Galaxy Note 2.Put the memory cards in and go to storage in the settings.  Click format card and off you go.I have not measured read or write speed but i can tell you i can copy over 1Gb video file in just a few seconds.,

"Works well, as advertised. I like the Class 10 speed. Price was right. Would recommend this product to others. Thank you.",
This is perfect. A lot of people were commenting that the case falls off and it's not portable. That's not the intended use of the case. It is strictly for decorative use. It look great and comes in several color options. Would definitely purchase again.,
Very good product!!!  Comes with an adaptor to fit regular size card slot.So your good to go for both.( I love it),
Stopped working and could not reformat.  Didn't have good luck with this item or the vendor selling this item.  Hopefully just a bad one...sandisk is usually pretty good,
"I bought the first Kindle when it came out and, while I liked it, I didn't use it that much because the page turn buttons could be too easily triggered, and the cover was somewhat clumsy to use. The second generation Kindle was a lot better, but I still preferred to read physical books with the Kindle being a solution for being able to have books available without taking up any more space (I still buy physical books, but most are donated to the local library, Salvation Army, etc. after I've read them).Next, about a year after it came out, I bought what Amazon called the Kindle Keyboard and was hooked! I began using the Kindle as a preferred reading medium over physical books and thought that the Kindle Keyboard couldn't be improved upon (I've since given a couple as gifts). I liked the storage capacity, the 3G capability and thought I wouldn't want to be without the keyboard. After reading more than seventy books on it I couldn't imagine trying a Kindle with less memory and only Wi-fi.I was wrong.I ordered this 4th Generation Kindle earlier this year, thinking I'd have it for a backup to my Kindle Keyboard. Instead, it has become my much-preferred device. Storage room With the cloud, it's really not an issue. I keep a few reference books on both of my current Kindles (the Keyboard and this one) as well as what I'm currently reading. I haven't had any problem with coming close to exceeding the storage capacity. While it would be nice to have 3G, it's not a deal-killer at all. I've already read close to 50 books on this Kindle and I've only found myself without easy access to Wi-fi once. When I'm close to finishing a book, I plan ahead and download a new one (or two) so that I'm ready wherever I happen to be.Read more",

"Do not buy, card failed on the third usage.  Kicker not to my favoris you only have about 2 months to return this card for a full refund.Then, it's a pro rated rated deal when you send it back to Amamzon inLexington, KY.The failed card was in a GoPro White Edition. Needless to say, a camera thatwas purchased for summer outdoor usage in November is going to sit for quite awhile before you have time to get your money back.  Card sat all winter and failedtowards the end of April.  6 months lag to get a decent, even pro rated refund.Out of all the items I bought from Amazon this is my only bad experience.64 gigs crammed on a tiny micro SD card is too much.  I'll stick with thesmaller 32 gigs until this technology is meant to last.Refund Update, once again Amazon did the right thing anbd refunded full purchase pricefor the dead 64 gig.  Amazon is where I shop for 2 reasons.  1. I live 50 miles frombig box stores and 2. they ALWAYS make things right with no muss ...no fuss.I replaced the dead card with Amazon brand Micro 32 gig SD micro card.I have purchased Amazon branded SD cards before and they work just as good as any.Not to mention the cost savings.",

"SanDisk makes a lot of claims about this card and some of them are questionable. I own two, and while the high-capacity/low-price certainly makes them useful, they're not the answer to all of my recording needs. First of all, do not use this with a GoPro Hero 3 (or later model). Despite SanDisk's claims, these cards cannot handle the demands of true HD recording. GoPro removed it from their list of recommended cards because it caused the cameras to lock up and turn off. Even with myCanon VIXIA HF10 Flash Memory High Definition Camcorder--technology which is over 10 years old--the SanDisk Ultra card does not meet the requirements for shooting in FXP mode (1920x1080, 17Mbps) even though the camera says only a class 4 is required. A firmware update to the GoPro 'fixed' the issue for Hero 3 and Hero 3+ cameras, but it did so by throttling the recording speed for the cards, i.e. lowering the quality of the recording slightly.Those shortcomings aside, the SanDisk Ultra can shoot in XP+ mode (1440 x 1080) on the Vixia HF10 and it works with all of the settings of aContourROAM Waterproof HD 1080P. Is it ""water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof, shock proof""? I can't say. The ContourROAM is a waterproof camera, so even non-waterproof cards are safe for submersion if they're in the housing. The Ultra has functioned in 10 weather and after being dropped, so there's validity to the claim of it being temperature- and shock-proof. I guess I'll find out whether it's x-ray-proof the next time I go through the airport...",
"These are great. This is my second Paperwhite and second charger. Thinking about a third, fourth...because while putting fiction on one and non-fiction on other have been thinking how great to have a Kindle dedicated just to recipes, another to health books etc would be marvelous",
For this capacity and price you can't go wrong.  I'm not sure what class this is but they recommend higher class for video. I would recommend this product. Good luck,
Great buy and cheaper than most stores. Fits my Galaxy S3 perfect for my music and photos. Fast speed and functionality.,

"As soon as I learned that my Nokia Lumia 1520 would gladly accept 128Gb MicroSD card, I sought one out. The $119 promo price on Amazon had evaporated along with the stock of the rare cards! The price had skyrocketed to nearly $200, AND THEY WERE OUT OF STOCK!? I pined. I whined. Then, one day, in early May, there it was! Back on Amazon, for the awesome price point of $119! I pulled the trigger immediately! Well, apparently the cards were on backorder, but in was a short wait. Four days later, I had my card. After formatting it via the phone, ands changing all my phone settings to save everything to the card, I'm a happy camper. Read/write speeds are good, and the only really noticible lag is when taking photos, but that has a lot to do with my choosing to take photos with a 5Mp ""low rest"" version, and a corresponding 16Mp RAW version,, too. Other than that, this drive has allowed me to store >1Gb apps(games), (of which I have many), and tons of pics, and 1080p videos! I'd say, that if your phone accepts 128Gb cards, this is a no brainer!",
"The SanDisk Ultra is a very high quality micro sd card. I have bought several and have never had an issue with any of them, which I can't say about less expensive cards. If you need a card for your smart phone or tablet, this is it, just make sure not to get a bigger capacity card than your device can use.",
"Using it in the kitchen mainly. It has good sound, works excellent as a cooking timer. Also alarm for certain events thruout the day. Nice music source.",
"Get just about you want in it, plenty of space to keep your best shots and memories.  It's the best and the price is very reasonable.",
Meet my needs but feel should be supplied when actually purchasing the Oasis E-Reader.,
Card works great in my GoPro Hero 3 White Edition. I did a 48 hour time lapse and had no issues whatsoever with corrupted data or missing files. I've always had good experiences with SanDisk products and recommend them to everyone.,
"This card only lasted two weeks before it began giving read errors. I used it in a dash cam and no matter how many times I formatted, it would only record for about a minute before failing again.

"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",

"This is a great case! It allows access to all ports and camera, while not taking from the protection of the tablet itself. It feels very durable, and I think it would protect the Fire well against accidental drops, bumps and scratches. As a blind individual, touch is very important to me. This product feels well made. It feels expensive, and I'm certain looks the same. The standing feature is great, it stands well for movie viewing or apps that do better in landscape. This is a great accessory for the new Fire 7. I'm sure there will be other companies making cases for it. But this is how the folks at Amazon envisioned their device, and it is amazing! Don't be fooled in to buying a cheaper product. Amazon devices do best with amazon accessories.",
"I have had to change the batteries in this remote once or twice per month since I purchased it in March. After the battery's short life span after the first battery replacement, we stopped doing any gaming with it and just used the gaming controller. It did not make a difference. It still drained the batteries just as quickly. I do have the option of using the phone app, and I do, but what if I'm not home and someone else wants to use the fire tv This is very, very poor quality product. Of course. It went out of warranty 12 days ago. I guess I should have been more mindful of that date. I do not recommend this product and I think Amazon should extend the warranty coverage. It is ridiculous that this remote basically doesn't work.",
"Although Amazon claim it is a C10 ultra fast Memory Card, it actually has much slower write speed than other C10 microSD card (it only scores about 60% of the normal speed). For example, I have tested it against my old Maxell C10 HC microSD card. The test was done by writing the same 3035MB random data from DRAM to empty microSD card through a USB3 card reader. The resulting time was the average value from 3 tests of each device:SanDisk Ultra 32GB C10/UHS1: 5m50.816s means 8.7MB/sMaxell C10 HC: 3m38.787s means 13.9MB/sThe speed is completely unacceptable for a Class-10 claim (13% lower than 10MB/s, the lowest boundary of Class-10 device), even the over-advertisement of SD card speeds are common (claiming 30MB/s for actual 12-15MB/s). It is almost a scam. Some Class-6 card will beat this ""Class-10"" card.",
"Do not buy this if speed is an issue. You want type 4 at least for speed, but this type 1 works great in my phone to just increase storage. I keep all my pictures on it and random files. I have not used it for music but imagine that since it plays my videos included with my pictures that it could easily handle music.",
Plug and Play simplicity. Popped it in and it works. Didn't even need to format it. I believe SanDisk said it was formatted as 'exFat' so I'm good with that and so is my wife's phone. It shows approximately 119Gb before use. Holds a whole heap of photos and videos.,
"UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more",

"Okay, I'm a memory hog. I admit it.The Note 3 has 32GB internal storage and it's nearly full. I had a 64GB microSD card in it and guess what? 15GB left! So what's a geek to do?Buy THIS! Wow, what breathing room I have! And then some! I copied the entire 64GB card to the 128GB card, and then added more HD movies. In addition to the phone's stuff, I have all 6 Star Wars movies, the Back to the Future trilogy, and the Indiana Jones movies on this card and room for plenty more. No doubt when the Note 4 comes out, I'll be ready with a kick-butt memory card.The Note 3's specs state that it will accept cards ""up to 64GB"". Well, at the time 64 was the highest card available, so they couldn't possibly test for a higher capacity. Phandroid / Android Forums, however, has a fairly comprehensive list of devices that are compatible with this card, accurate to the date of the article:[...]So I'm a happy camper. Yes, I paid a premium for being an early adopter... but I'll be saving my pennies for the inevitable Black Friday sale in November, which will be just about the time the Note 4 is released. Folks, I can't recommend this card enough: just make SURE you're backing up to a PC regularly! If it does fail, you definitely want your precious pics and data backed up.",
Bought it for my Galaxy Note 2. Add tons of storage to my phone. Now I can store video and songs.,
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",

"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",

I bought 3 when they were on sale but I did buy 1 prior to the sell. I use it in my go pro and it works great. (I can't compare to others tho because this is the only memory card I've used before),
Got this for my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Recognized it immediately. Seems to work fast for the pics and videos I've taken. No complaints. The price on these things fluctuates quite a lot. I would recommend to use a price tracker (camel camel camel) on this before purchasing or at least pay attention to the price a couple of days of purchase. The price had dropped by fifteen dollars after it shipped. Amazon's awesome customer service refunded the difference without any trouble. Thanks!,

"Bought October 7th. Passed away December 23rd. RIP.I didn't really even use it because of the built in storage on my GS3. I had about 15 gb of music and movies on it, but only for when I was unexpectedly bored and without my zuneHd. On to the next brand I guess.",
It makes me so happy to listen all kind of their music station,
I got this while it was on a deep sale here on Amazon. I couldn't pass it up. It comes with an standard SD card adapter so it'll work in your computer or anywhere else you can stick an SD card. It hasn't had any faults and does the job.,
I love it it does everything I want can't believe how great it is,
"Lot's of space now! My Galaxy was getting full, so I got this. Tons of space for movies and music and pictures and videos and kindle. Get the point? Lots of space.",
It works just like it should. It really does work like it should. I bought this thinking it would work and it does!,
"I installed this on my Galaxy Note 2 and it crashed after one month. Lost all my pictures on the card. Had it not been for Google Plus instant upload and redundant backup to Dropbox all of the pictures would have been lost. I think I should get a refund but I did not keep the original packaging. I would not buy this, but if you do keep the packaging so you can return it. If you read most of the reviews you will see that a lot of people have had trouble with this card crashing. I don't think Amazon should offer it as it hurts their overall customer satisfaction.",
"works great in a Samsung phone. Easy to use, get to, and can take some punishment...i'll be buying more soon",
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
"What more can be said?  It's a great card with plenty of storage space to handle or expand your tablet, camera or video cameras needs.  With the included SD card adapter, the micro card can be read in any SD card reader/writer.  It is initially formatted in some format that my Windows 8 Pro MS Surface Pro could read or see.  But from another laptop using the SD adapter I was able to reformat it and make it usable for the Surface Pro.Great card for a great price!",
"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded. I've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that I'd expect any besides possible fading).",
"Works great. Adapter makes it easy to load music, ebooks, pictures and movies onto card for use on a phone or tablet.",
"works great on my sprint htc evo 4g lte.  Formatted w/ fat32 so of course the maximum file size is 4gb meaning no full length hidef movies.  However, this isn't a problem;  I bought the card for putting a music library on my phone.Like all class 10 micro-sdhc cards, it does NOT do 10MB/s, but it's closer than any other class 10 card I've ever tried.  Most do 3-4MB/s.  Kingston 32GB did 7MB/s.  This card does about 8-9MB/s.Can't wait till 128GB and 256GB cards become available and affordable.",
This case is very well made and sturdy. It perfectly matches the color of the tablet. I cannot figure out how to use the back as a stand. There is only one way it folds so it should not be that difficult. It does not work for me so I have given it a 4 star review.,
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
Very useful for those who enjoy reading and inspiring those who do not have a habit of reading. Needed for anyone not yet,
"Works great in a Samsung Galaxy S3.  Formatted straight away, full size there.  I can't really tell the speed difference between this one and a slower card it replaced.  I guess the IO in the phone can't take advantage.",
"I got this for my cell phone and it was easy to put in. I have had not problems with it at all, it's been in my phone for a few months now and it's great having all the extra storage for pictures. I got it on time and it was so easy to remove from the package.",
"So far it has worked very well, stores more that I need which is a great feature. Another nice feature is the red paint, really, I drop these little cards and the all black version are often hard to find, the red is easy to spot, now if it only glowed in the dark..lol",
I used it with my Samsung S4 and it works great. I bring a lot of music and movies with me when I travel and it is great that I don't have to bring an entire hard drive or extra memory cards that can be misplaced. Totally worth the money.,
"I can say that SanDisk is one of the best company in the fields of electronics and Digital Cameras, but I am very dissapointed of this Memory Card.The card memory is only 25GB and the speed is 14MB/s which is not as advertised.I gave it to my dad to use it on his phone and I started to use the Sony 32GB MicroSD. I can say that it works perfectly: the storage is 32GB and the speed is 43MB/s.Buy it now: http://amzn.to/1iGqMVm . This is the exact link I used to buy mine.",
"I absolutely love this speaker. It is easy to use and the app is user friendly. I have used it at the beach, pool, lake, and park I will not travel without it.",
"You can't go wrong purchasing this memory card. The more memory, the more you can store. It is FAST and reliable. On my GoPro Hero3 cam, one can store up to 9 hours of video time and LOTS of images. I never keep track because I have so much space. I've been able to store many videos and images on this memory card. I highly recommend the SanDisk Ultra!",
Got this for my sweetie. Her tablet has 32 on board. She likes books and this will hold a lot. That and the quality and price are great.,
I've ordered other SD cards before but this one is the best overall. Shipping was excellent fast and reliable. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a quality product. Thanks again!,
"Received today and there was a surprise in the package.  It contained an adapter so the Micro SD card can be used in a traditional SD slot.  I don't need it, but I can see where it might come in handy if I want to transfer files directly to my laptop.Actually, I purchased this for a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 - 8&#34; tablet which also has a USB port for attaching a flash drive or any other storage, so I could always transfer data that way. In any case, I don't expect any problems, but the Galaxy will not arrive until Monday.",

"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
Second remote. Stopped working. Will not work with firestick software on tv. Very carefully chose home arrows ..has a mind of it's own. Had to unplug so that it wouldn't deregister device! I did not(!) choose that selection. Bad device. Kept defaulting to video game or going to sleep/options window. However none would select. Going to look for another service.,
"I can storage a lot on this little thing, lots of videos, lots of pictures. And it's great that I can just take it from my tablet and insert it again on my phone. Also, with a SD adapter, I can place it on my camera and there's no significant speed loss, I mean, I didn't notice anything.",
"It came in an easy-to-open package, I installed right away to my new Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition, and works great!",
"Bought this to use on my HTC EVO 3D, which is supposed to have a maximum cap or 32 gb, however after formatting the card in FAT32 format, the phone will read it, and functions w/out any issues. unlike my old memory cards, even with a power loss I have not experienced any lost pictures or videos. worth the price since when i bought this over a year ago, it was still double the price retail and no one carried it locally.",
"I bought a bunch of these for many many hours use with hi-res video cameras and every one has been fast and flawless.Plus, if you get more than one like me, you might want a way to keep track of which is which. Notice there is a small blank area in the red to the right of the SanDisk name. You can write a number there with a fine tip marker. Don't try that on one of those solid black chips!",
I'm finding more and more electronics are using micro SD cards.So I'm stocking up. Good buy for the price.,
"Exactly what it is supposed to be. Works great and I love the built-in light. Perfect reader, and very quick delivery.",
"I have loved and used my Kindle Keyboard for years now but I missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark. I purchased a Kindle Fire and I also use an iPad 3 but for ease of reading on my eyes I prefer the Kindle Keyboard. I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this new generation was released before I spent my money. I got this because I wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and I just love this new tablet. It offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text.I have added a video of the Kindle Paperwhite compared to a Kindle Keyboard and a Kindle Fire. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I will try to answer them.I love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear. I use the Kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books. Reading was my number one hobby my entire life and I just loved it. The Kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen I can enjoy my reading in every type of environment. I laid my Kindle Keyboard and the New Kindle Paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new Paperwhite. The new lighting system and screen clarity is where this Paperwhite design really is outstanding. With better contrast, lighting and custom designed fonts, the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e-Reader before. With 221 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) this screen provides a 768 by 1024 pixel screen that just makes the old Kindle Keyboard look old fashioned. Technology certainly does move quickly on.Read more",
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",

Bought this for a Samsung tablet which  arrived busted. The tablet long gone back.Still got the Sandisk which is looking for a home in a another tablet.,
Works as it should. i use it with my GoPro HERO 3+ and I have not had any issues. Holds tons of footage. I have 4 of these and it is overkill but they were so cheap that why not. Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.,
"This is a great SD card, it's very fast and works well.  I have been using it for my GoPro with no complaints.",
Works great with my Galaxy S4. Didn't need to format the card or anything. Just popped the card in and everything worked great out of the box. Transfer speeds are excellent with this card. I would recommend this card to everyone.,
"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.",
"I bought this as an expanded/backup memory for my tablet (a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3), and it installs easily, works quickly, and even has a great SanDisk memory app that helps me organize my files and see a visual representation of how much memory is taken and how much is free.It came with an adapter so I can plug it into my computer to transfer files if I want to, which is awesome.  Nothing bad to say about this memory card!",
"I tried to read some articles and reviews on cards, when wanting to store music on my phone for the Amazon MP3 app. I found it to be a bit confusing and in the end took a chance and just ordered this one. I couldn't be happier with it. I found an app that automatically moves my Amazon MP3 downloads to the card and I'm able to store a ton of music on the phone, saving me from having to stream it and jeopardize my 2GB Verizon limit. This was a painless install that I should have done a lot sooner.",
"This MicroSD card made for a great upgrade for my Galaxy S 3's storage capacity.  The card performs efficient read/writes and is giving my phone the kind of data storage I never thought I'd have.  If anyone is looking for enough storage space on their phone or tablet for a large amount of pictures, video's, apps, or even document files, this may be exactly what you're looking for.",
"My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new friend named Alexa!

Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.Happy HolidaysRoy",
"This memory card works on my Motorola Droid RAZR M! Even though my phone's &#34;information guide&#34; says it is only compatible with a 32GB memory card.  Once formatted, it works great.  So worth not spending the extra money just to get a phone with a ton of built in internal memory.",
"So far, this is doing what I wanted it to. I purchased it for having Alex hear me from my bedroom and my dining room. At times when I am playing music louder or just wanting her to do a command, I have to repeat myself louder. I usually keep the remote in the bedroom to give her commands but I will move it when I have company and am sitting down to eat or with guests in living room. I can practically whisper the command using the remote whereas without it, I have to shout the command out to the other room. Also, did not find opening the back to insert batteries that difficult. Did take a few tries to pair it. I ended up replacing the batteries that were sent with Duracell",
"Bought this for my son's tablet (asus prime) and it works great.  We were able to load his music, movies, and a few apps and haven't noticed any lag time as we have in the past with other cards.  Would definitely purchase more.",
"Transfer speeds are good, worth the price tag, use it in my samsung galaxy s3, sometimes it craps out and has to be reformatted or rebooted in phone. Otherwise no problems",
We use these in both our cameras when we are traveling. With the 32 GB we do not have to take a bunch of accessories. We also use them in our Cell Phones.,
Great card with fast write times. Excellent for use in DSLR or Gopro camera. I have used it to save both photos and movies.,
Works wonderfully. I had this sd for over nine months and it is still working great. I had trouble getting it to recognized at first by my S3.Formatting from phone and or generic windows format menu did not resolve this issue so I downloaded EaseUs partition master and formatted and it has been working like charm ever since.Write Speed: 8.4 MB/s @ default cache speed.Read Speed: 37.9 Mb/s @ default cache speed.,
I added this to my Samsung S3 32gb phone and it works great. I can store most of my music for when i travel. I will nevery have to listen to the same thing on a signal trip.,
the microSD card works wonderfully with my galaxy tab3 and gives me a great deal of extra storage for my media on the tablet,
"the best quality there is in memories is super fast, wonderful and cantiad of gigas is very good, the best brand and speed",
Shipped fast.  Works in my camera..  Does store video much faster than my older memory card.  For the price it is a good deal.,
"Now my new surface tablet is complete!With all this storage I redirected my photos, music, videos and documents to save to the card. Its fast and I love keeping my internal storage available for apps only.",
"The package arrived on time, it's very well packed and it's got an adapter. It works perfectly with my phone, though it doesn't allow a computer format, once it's been on the phone, so it asks you to erase everything before you use it on a computer. So if you're planning on buying this for different purposes and devices, gotta be aware of this. I just need for my phone, so I transfer files with my usb cable, that works just right. I also give it a 3 star because it says there are 64gb, but even when it's totally formatted it only reaches to 60gb..sooo, I don't know where my other 4 gb are...anyways, overall it's working well. I do think it's expensive for what it is.",
"As the title says, it can cause your GoPro Hero 3 to stop recording mid recording if used at the highest resolutions and frame rates.",
"The card seemed to work well in most devices that I tried it in, but in a Samsung Galaxy S4 it would continue to unmount and mount over & over on the phone - a known issue on the Galaxy S4 forums due to a possibly bad batch of them.  I tried to reformat the card in the phone and from a PC computer, but that didn't help.  Finally I just called SanDisk and they had to RMA the card, which took about 2 weeks from start to finish when I had the new card in my hand.  The new 64 GB card from SanDisk looks slightly different, but still has gray & red on it.  However, it now works great in the Galaxy S4 and hasn't had any unmounting issues now for the past 3 weeks.Good card for pretty much everything else, except in the new Samsung Galaxy S4 phones.",

"Bought this for my wife's Samsung TL240, which kept locking up with a lesser speed SD card. After throwing this card in there, the camera rarely locks up when taking pictures back-to-back. If you are shooting 10+ MP and taking pictures back-to-back or shooting HD vid, it's a good idea to upgrade to a Class 10 card.",
"This is a review of the Kindle Paperwhite launched July 2015. Essentially. the same as the previous Kindle Paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded (300 dpi) screen, more memory and storage it's a terrific reading device. This review aims to describe both this product, and compare it with the other Kindle devices available to help you choose the best one for you.Before I start, Ive noticed several complains about Kindle not supporting the ePub format used by Canadian public libraries. Dont be put off, theres a solution in the Frequently Asked Questions section below.This review is broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits. If youre in a hurry Ive included a summary at the start, and a Frequently Asked Questions section at the end.Summary - What can you do with it-----------------------------------------* Read a book. It can store 1,000s of books - take an entire library away with you on holiday.* Buy a book. You can browse the Amazon kindle store, and buy books over a WIFI connection* Borrow a book. Using the Kindle Owners Library you can borrow one of 60,000 books (if you have Amazon Prime Membership)* Share your books. Using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family* Highlight a section. Using the touch screen, you can highlight a particulary interesting few lines. If several people highlight the same section, that's also indicated.* Record a bookmark. To come back to it later* Read a book on your Kindle, continue on your smartphone or tablet computer, and it will jump to your last known position* Look up a word, and record them in the vocabulary builder* Track a characters appearance throughout a book using the X Ray feature.* Read for weeks without needing to recharge - typically 4-6 weeks* Share you books (Multiple Kindles on the same account, or family sharing)* Access every book you've ever owned on the cloud - available for download within seconds over WIFI or 3G..What Devices are available--------------------------------As of July 2015, Amazon have the following Kindle devices on sale:-1. Kindle 6 (around CDN 79)2. Kindle Paperwhite 6th Generation (212 dpi - launched October 2013) - around CDN 1292. New Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen (300 dpi - launched July 2015) - around CDN 139-2093. Kindle Voyger - around US 219-289 (Doesnt seem to be on sale in Amazon Canada)4. Kindle Fire - 6 or 7 colour tablet computers at around CDN 300-400So you're faced with a few devices, plus additional options. Which to buy Here's a quick summary in order of cost.*** The entry level Kindle ***An entry level black and white (e-ink) book reader, it has a 6 inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books, and a battery which should last around 4 weeks.A terrific device to read books, and a worthy contender. For the technically minded, it has a 1Ghz processor and 4Gb of memory with an E-ink display. Essentially this means it's (a) Black and White (b) Fantastic to read even in bright sunlight (c) Requires very little power - hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours.*** New Kindle Paperwhite ***Launched in 2015, this is really an upgrade adding a super-sharp display with 300 pixels per inch - the same as the top of the range Voyage. The high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye, but battery life is reduced from 8 weeks of the original Paperwhite to 6 weeks - but still a very long time.Compared to the existing (2013) Paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means its faster and slicker than before, and a new Bookerly font plus better presentation of fonts on screen.If you have an existing Paperwhite its probably not worth upgrading. However, if you own a prior device, youll notice the huge leap in screen quality, contrast and performance.*** The Voyage ***Far more expensive that Paperwhite, this is thinner and 26g lighter. It has more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the e-reader body which makes it look more like a tablet, and keeps dirt from getting caught in the edges. The back has a soft touch plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand, and it has new Page Press buttons on the side to turn the pages. When the buttons are pressed theres a gentle vibration for feedback (nice touch). It has 4Gb of storage (same as the Paperwhite), and a similar battery which should last around 6 weeks on a single charge.Although it has the same sharp (300 dpi) screen as the Paperwhite, the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions. This means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright. In addition, youll find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness. To compensate, the Voyage automatically softens the light slightly. A lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device.*** Kindle Fire Tablet Computer ***The Kindle Fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the Kindle range. Similar to the Apple iPad mini, it has a high resolution screen, a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life - hours rather than weeks. Although you can read books on a Fire using the Amazon Kindle App, youll find the Kindle with its sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book. Youll find it produces less eye strain, and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web, watching videos and reading eMails, the Kindle is a dedicated book reader device.Unlike a Kindle, the Fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep. The Paperwhite and Voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back-light which is far more suited to reading in bed, and it wont for example, wake your partner if reading in the dark.Finally, unlike the rest of the Kindle range, the Fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while its fine for everyday use, its less useful on holiday. The Kindle range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books, and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight.What other options do I have----------------------------------Having decided upon the model (Kindle, Paperwhite, Voyage or Fire), the next decision is around:-* Special Offers - ie. adverts* 3G or WIFI connectionPersonally I have no issue with adverts on a Kindle. They only appear on screen when the screen saver is on, and are not at all distracting.The 3G option is a more difficult question. This effectively means you can use your kindle to buy or download books over-the-air instead of at home or near a WIFI hotspot. Personally I went for the WIFI model as the saving is considerable, but its a personal choice. Of course if you wont have WIFI at home, then youll need the 3G option.One point worth mentioning however, is if you have a modern smartphone, you can always create a Personal Hotspot or local WIFI signal that your Kindle (or indeed any other WIFI device) can connect to. Got to Settings Personal Hotspot on your mobile to set one up, and you can connect your WIFI only Kindle while youre out and about.Conclusion-------------If you love books but your on a budget, the original Kindle with WIFI and special offers is a great option. Youll still be able to carry thousands of book around with you, but youll lose out on the soft white back-light and super crisp display of the Papwerwhite.The Kindle Paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb 300 dpi super-sharp screen. Finally, theres the top of the range Voyage with the page press buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness.If youre in the market for a Tablet Computer then the Kindle Fire range is worth considering, but youll get a better book reading experience on the Kindle. Myself I have both a Paperwhite and an iPad Air 2. I was skeptical at first, but the Kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand (on the train), and the back-light and long battery life a huge bonus.Frequently Asked Questions---------------------------------Q: What file format will a Kindle readA: Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively in addition to HTML, DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversionQ: What It doesnt support EPUB formatA: No - but you can convert your EPUB books using a freely available program called Calibre. Simple search for You Tube um0teoAR6zw and youll see a video explaining how to do this. Simples.Q: If I lose my Kindle, do I lose my books as wellA: No. All books are available on your Amazon account to download on a new device.Q: Can I save my place in the bookA: Yes. It will automatically save your place, and if you resume on other device it will prompt you to jump to that position.Q: I often need reading glasses - can I adjust the font sizeA: Yes. Theres a range of fonts, and sizes to suit all tastesQ: Can I share books with my partner or childrenA: Yes. You can now share your books using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire familyQ. Can I use a Kindle to read in bedA. Yes. But only on the Paperwhite and Voyage models. Its a pleasure to read in the dark with a soft white light. For the base Kindle model youll need the light onQ. Are there any free books availableA. Yes! Over 40,000 classic titles are available for free (out of copyright), and they can be legally downloaded. If you have a Amazon Prime membership you can also borrow a book from the Kindle Owners Library which includes around 60,000 books.Q: How long does the battery lastA: Depending upon model, you should get between 4 and 6 weeks between charges on around 30 minutes of reading per day. Ive certainly found Ive gone for weeks without charging the deviceQ: How long does it take to chargeA: From absolutely flat, around 4 hoursQ: How many books will the Kindle holdA: Literally thousands. You can also download every book youve ever owned from your Amazon account - so the list is quite literally unlimited.Q: Do I need anything elseA: Youll need a smartphone charger or laptop with a USB socket as the Kindle range doesnt come with a charger (but the Fire does). Amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it. Some people also buy a cover, but I think this is not really needed. It adds to the weight, and is not really needed. It will protect your Kindle from a drop however, and protect the screen if its left knocking around in a bag.",
SD is always reliable and top of the line quality. I will always buy SD and none other. Great buy.,
"Have not experienced any wirting speed problem with my android sticks or PC. So I suppose it lives up to the 10X claimed. Tried with both SDHC & SDXC readers on both abdroid TV's and PC's USB ports, and all worked as smmoth as silk.",
"Good size card and a great price. My only complaint is with the adapter card. The little lip on the end of the micro card is almost nonexistent and the adapter card slot is very, very tight. The only way I could get the micro card out was with needle nose pliers. Had to take a utility knife to the opening of the adapter card so I could actually slide it in an out with ease.",
"The name should speak for itself! It comes with a regular SD card adapter. If one day you feel that you have no need for a microSD card then just simply put it back into the adapter and use it as a regular SD card for your camera or other electronics that takes a form of a regular SD card. It reads and write very fast, which it should since it's a class 10 card! I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it's a nice addition to storing those big 1080p files & MP3 music loads. Hands down the best brand in the industry for SD cards! I highly recommend it!",
The sound in this is on par with other high end portable speakers. That however is really just the tip of the iceberg. If you have amazon prime you can access all your music just by asking. Also this works if you have Phillips hue so you can turn the lights off and on with your voice.,
"I needed more storage for my Venue 8 Pro tablet, plugged it in and was able to store large files on it within minutes. So far so good.",
"Listen, I am basically an Amazon fanboy...I do a lot of shopping thru Amazon, so it pains me to write this review, but it's gotta be done. Corporate stupidity just HAS to be addressed.I have a couple Roku's, a Google Chromecast, a couple TiVo's, etc.(1) Voice search is nice, but searching overall is UNACCEPTABLE as it is NOT a universal search, like on Roku (i.e...search ALL sources for a movie, etc, not just Amazon).(2) Will there EVER be a way, Amazon (are you listening), to search Prime for the FREE content The Fire TV doesn't do it. Unacceptable.(3) The Roku 3 has a headphone jack on the remote...BRILLIANT...this simply has to be a standard feature on these kinds of boxes...but the Fire TV does not have it. Unacceptable.(4) No HBOGO. Unacceptable.(5) No volume control. OK, none of these boxes have what would be a VERY desirable feature...a volume control on the remote...so the Fire TV does not lack here compared to the competition, but it sure seems like Amazon should have figured out how desirable a volume control would be, and included it.(6) Adding android apps is very hard for average users.",
What else to say about this Sandisk Ultra 64 GB micro SD XC ? just perfect as all Sandisk cards,
"This card is great. Ive noticed slight improvement in every aspect of my phone. So much space! Very pleased. Came on time. Brand new. Easy to open thanks to Amazon. And it mentions on the tiny booklet that this thing is temperature resistant. Thats a big plus since overuse of smartphones tend to heat em up pretty good. Being from Texas, the heat out here only makes em hotter. And my last SD seems to have fried. Well this is a good buy. If i need another i'd definitly buy again. Maybe the black and gold one. It only available in 16GB but its super fast.",
"I was given this card in October to add to my new Samsung Galaxy S3. I was thrilled I copied a ton of music onto the card and used my phone as my mobile Ipod substitute, leaving my Ipod Classic on my desktop in its speaker system cradle.Everything worked fine until a couple of weeks ago. I started getting messages that seemed to say that I had removed and inserted the memory card. Of course, I hadn't touched it. Then a few days ago the phone told me that the card contained unsupported files and that I needed to reformat it. Well, I tried reformatting. After that, nothing. Nothing at all. I pulled the memory card, reset the phone. Reinserted the card. Nothing. I tried the card in the adapter on 3 computers. It wasn't even visible.I called Sandisk tech support. It didn't take terribly long to convince them that I had a problem. But they quickly offered me two 16 gb cards as a replacement. I literally laughed at them. I got the disturbing sense that this is something that they are required to try. If so, that's a lousy business practice. After bouncing me around a few time, they agreed to send me an RMA and a shipping label. I duly sent the card off a couple of days ago. To be frank, I have no idea at all when I might receive a replacement.If I weren't already in the grips of Sandisk, I would buy another card. The fact that 10% of the comments here are negative is an indication of a real quality control problem. A 10% fail rate is simply unacceptable for a product such as this.Update: Well, I do have to give Sandisk credit for customer support. I returned the card using the supplied UPS label on a Tuesday and I received a replacement by UPS on the following Monday. That's very good service. It does, however, increase my suspicion about the offer of two 16 gb because the 32 gb cards were ""out of stock."" If they were out of stock, they sure got ""in stock"" in a big hurry. In any event, I've upped my rating to two stars.",
"This is one of the best products we have every purchased. Plays any songs, give directions, weather and the sound quality is EXCELLENT!",
"Great price delivered to my front door what more could you ask for. Access speeds are quick enough for my phone (note 3), have had no issues thus far.",
"Bought this to use in a ContourROAM video camera. It was the Deal of the Day, meaning a special discounted price. Also came with hassle-free packaging. Never a worry with SanDisk memory. Awesome deal.",
"I've purchased this MicroSD card back in January for use in my tablet and my Android smartphone.  I've used this card extensively to transfer music and files and I've found it's rather interchangeable and versatile across a number of surfaces.  The card hasn't corrupted itself or become unusable at any point so I figure, for the value, that's pretty much what I want.  And 32 GB covers the amount of storage I would want for my mobile devices.",
"Love this card, its fast and sports an insane 128gb of storage. Amazon had a killer price on it too, well below the big box stores. Works perfect with my phone and my HD video recorder.",
"Very, very good and reliable.  Use it in my Win8 tablet, so I don't take it out a lot, but when I do, it seems to work fine in other places.  I bought it a while ago, and it's never failed.  I would recommend it.",
This card allows the camera to work for hours and continued copies.It was one of the best purchases I have ever made. It was worth the money.,
"Bought this because I discovered that I had accidently left a class 2 card in my phone for over a year. Was troubleshooting the sluggishness and realized my error. This card, while not officially supported, works perfectly fine. I partitioned it using the ROM Manager. Also installed Link2SD and moved the largest apps to an ext2 partition.",
"This is a class 10 microSD card, and it works just as advertised. It's very fast- good for recording HD video and such. It's pretty decently priced per gig for a card of its class.However, beware that adapter that comes with it! Put the card in, good luck getting it back out. I made the mistake of doing this to test the memory on my laptop, and actually had to resort to pliers to pull them out, which is probably not a great way to keep the chip in tip-top shape. Note I also said 'them' there- I got two of these and they were both that way, so I doubt it was just a manufacturing defect.Buy the memory, throw away the adapters. Seriously, they are dangerous to use and for all intents and purposes convert it into a standard SD card permanently.Pro:ReliableFastGood priceCon:Adapter: It's a trap!",
"Lots of capacity, no problems with loading it up, and no issues with corruption.  Transfers and access are fast and you really can't beat the price for a name-brand card.Not much more to say... it's a memory card that works :-)",
"There really isn't a whole lot to say about this. The amount of storage space is fantastic.There are options for using this on older devices, that don't necessarily support MicroSDXC formats. Windows, by default, will only allow you to format the card as exFat or NTFS. These formats will work for most new devices, but some may have issue.If you use FAT32 as the filesystem instead, you can use this card for older devices, and it still works great with Android. I've been using this card on my old Sandisk Sansa Fuze (running Rockbox) and it works great. I was not expecting that, but I am very happy with it!",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
I purchased a couple of these for use with a new digital camera that also shoots 1080p video. This is a great product for that purpose. Fast transfers and I have had no hiccups in writing to the card.,
"I used it for my Galaxy Note 3. It works fine, no lags no problems. Data transfer is good. Thanks",
I use this for my family - 3 Samsung Flight II phones.  We have not experienced any problems.  The kids take a lot of pictures with their phone.,
"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysOctober 11, 2013Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound, and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD. As you correctly point out, the new Kindle Fire HD is the successor to last year's entry level Kindle Fire, which does not include features such as camera, microphone, or HDMI port. You are also correct to point out that this device does not support Mayday, although there are still multiple ways to get help for free directly from your device. We hope you enjoy the new features and services. Thanks, The Kindle Team",
I never give 5 stars because there is nothing in life that is perfect and you really don't know if there's a problem until you've used something for several months. This kindle meets all of my expectations and seems to be working just great.,
I paid less than $60 shipped to my door. Had it for 2mth and have had no problems after formatting it to FAT32... and its as fast as my internal  memory in my note 2.,
"After extensive review / research I wanted the best 64gb available to improve/increase memory for Samsung tab 3 7.0 many cards out there but this one loaded up quickly and appears to be ready for add on apps and preserving meory storage. The price was right, delivered quickly even with holiday, loaded and was quickly loaded/compatible with Samsung tab 3 7.0. Sandisk actually has a use chart that will show shopper what card to use for their device. Very helpful",
"If you want one of the most advanced alarm clocks on the market then this is your device!It works well. Calendar functions, plays radio, most podcasts, can order Domino's. But you have to be aware that most features require to some degree Amazon Prime membership. For example Spotify will not work unless it is a premium account.",
"We have a dash cam that came with only 8 gigs of storage... so we ended up only having the last half of our Moab jeeping adventure.  With these, we will never have to worry about recording over the good stuff",
Almost a year with this card and no problems so far. I used first with my GN 2 and now with my Note 10 2014 edition. Fingers crossed.,
"This is my 4th Kindle since I bought my first one as soon as Kindle was launched. With every new model, I was fascinated by the improvements and kept recommending them to friends. The Voyager was the first time I felt somewhat frustrated with an Amazon product.Yes, it is lighter and even easier to read than my previous models - if you are buying your first one, don't hesitate - it is still a great product and still much more comfortable to use than trying to read a book on an iPad - even if it is an iPad Mini.But... There are a few things that I thing Amazon should fix on this one, specially because it is the top of the line Kindle:1. The battery cover just keeps disconnecting from the reader itself. The magnetic attachment is just not strong enough to keep it in position as you manipulate the reader. Previous covers just stayed in place and even the Apple magnetic cover attaches better than this one.2. As you are able to turn off the page buttons on the side, you should be able to turn off page turning on the screen. The way I got used to handle the kindle and as I constantly change hands when I am reading, I get a lot of undesired page turns because I touched the screen somewhere. A very simple fix that could be in one of the next software updates that would greatly improve my perception of the device.3. Battery life (even with the cover) is far from what I expected. My old Kindle had a battery that lasted for more than a month, the new one needs recharging every 15 days.4. The device itself is so light and the battery cover so cumbersome that it should come with a simple,e cover just to protect the screen when you throw it in the bag.5.Read more",
"Came pre-formatted and easy to install. Came with adapter which is great. I recommend this if you are looking for a micro memory card, very worth the price.",
It's a memory card. It works. What else do I need to say. I'll be using it in a data logging project soon.,
Good priced memory comes in plain white wrapper and an adaptor for SD card size. It didn't forget what I put on it so I guess it works.,
"If you do not have WiFi connection, my device says I am connected with excellent score, the airplane mode is off, but still no real connection. Try using the online help with connectionOf course they do not publish a telephone number thus, it is worthless",
its 64 gigs it works great not sure what else to say about it really. Not much else to say.,
These work great in a GoPro Hero 3+ Black.,

"I bought exactly the same micro SDHC SanDisk Ultra 32GB about a year ago and which I'm using daily. This stuff is reliable, it has never gave me any sort of problem. My setup for this card is like a hard drive in a PC where I Read/Write a lot of large amount of data everytime like video files, photos, maps, documents and it has been working flawlessly. Not an instance I recall that it failed me and also it is fast. My tablet is my PC now and I'm using it for several hours each day. All of my data are set to be read and written into this external disk. I couldn't be more happier. I had use other brands in the past but somehow it didn't meet my expectations. The new disk I ordered will be my backup copy just in case I lost my tablet.",
"I bought two of these 128 gb MicroSD cards which I formatted to Fat32, and I currently have about 62 gb in 35,000 files on each card.  I carry one card in my wallet and keep one in a safe deposit off-site.  I've been through the SanDisk literature looking to see if there are any restrictions on their use, other than as ordinary &#34;flash memory&#34; for file storage.  There are no restrictions I could find.  What I have found is that these 128 gb cards (and a SanDisk 64 gb card I bought previously) cannot accept 62 gb of data written from a computer without suffering errors.  I've had to resort to copying no more than 1/3 gb of data at a time to these cards, stopping, then starting another 1/3 gb until the complete data is copied.  The errors actually occur early on, at approximately the 2 to 3 gb point.  I have several other 128 gb flash memory sticks - the Lexar Echo series, as well as a hundred other lower-capacity flash memory cards, and do not have this overflow/error problem with any of those.  To repeat, there are no restrictions on the use of these memory cards (example: can be used only in a camera) given by SanDisk, and given that the 62 gb of data on each card has been verified as to integrity, they are not defective.",
"The case that came with my Oasis had an edge that wasn't quite glued down. Amazon replaced it without difficulty and the new case is flawless.It detaches from the Oasis quickly and easily. I pull the Kindle off when I'm holding it one-handed and pop it right back in when finished.My only complain, which is a minor one, is that the felt inside cover can collect dust and dirt. But I don't know that there's a better way to construct it since the interior needs to be soft when it rests against the screen.In any case, it's a brilliant bit of kit, and I would buy another in an instant were anything to happen to the one I have now.",
"I love everything about this case except for how it fits on the Echo Dot. I was expecting a snug fit however, it is very lose and so you have to make sure that if you pick it up to move it (and the power cable is disconnected), the dot will fall out of the case.",
I added 128bg with two San Disk Ultra 64GB memory cards to my PSP with a micro SDXC Adapter to the memory stick duo.,
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
Haven't been using very long but so far it's working great,
"Sling is simply awesome and so is the Amazon Tap!! My tap arrived this morning along with this sling and I am currently testing both products out as we speak!! This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.)

Bought this gift for my wife and she loves it. Works as expected.,
"Working perfectly so far, fit my ZEEPAD Android exactly & is running great.  I recommend this 32 GB Card for any Android or similar device needing additional recording space.",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
I've enjoyed using the features Alexa app and like the portability that this unit offers. The sound quality is good.,
Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Note II.  Install it and forget about it.  I've never had a problem with it.,
It's unreal that 64 GB of data fit in this small of a memory card. Not too long ago this was considered futuristic. :),
I love this card and it is super fast. Great for putting it in a tablet to keep it from slowing up. And it was $15 reg $70 gives me something to brag about too.,
I like the device. I had the Apple TV. THE Amazon is better than apple and Roku. The only network Amazon needs is the WWE Network app. There is a lot of WWE fans out there with Amazon that would love this app.,
I bought this to use in my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it works great.  Transfer speed is excellent and it is completely plug-and-play compatible with my device.,
I bought one for my daughter and one for my daughter-in-law: they inserted them into their phones and transferred their iTunes to their Galaxy S2 and S3 phones.,
"Hard to review this as the card arrived DOA. Couldn't write to it at all, and it wouldn't format. I returned it and Amazon was great about the credit. I've owned several SanDisk memory cards and they have all performed well and I was a little surprised that this one failed out of the box. I'd read a good review of the Samsung 64GB micro card and I bought that instead. Very pleased with it.",
There is nothing really to say except that I love having this much storage and not having to worry about running out.,
dont need any extra cards now!,
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
"Good amount of space for the stuff I want to do, and fits in my GoPro. What more can I say?",
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
"I bought this to go along with my new S4 that I purchased and I have to say I am pleasantly surprised at how much 32GB can get you on a phone!  I have pushed all of my apps to my SD card which has given me plenty of free room on my phone (a major detraction placed on the S4 especially).  I do notice that since moving most of my apps to the card, some load times and other features may take an extra second to really get going.  This may lead me towards going with more powerful SD cards in the future though I am assured this will work for all of my current needs.",
"Easy to set up literally plug it in, download the apps wanted, and go. No software installation. No issues-so far. Incredibly user friendly interface. The only thing I am slightly pissed about is the fact that my signature/someone answering the door wasn't required when the package was delivered, a 100 piece of equipment was just left on my doorstep. Other than that, I'm quite happy with it",
Bought it for my tablet.  Its worth it to pay a couple bucks more for quality instead of trying to seek out the rock bottom priced bargain sometimes.  There's a lot of counterfeit cards out there but you don't have to worry about being suckered like that when you buy a SanDisk or other quality name brand memory card.,
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
good storage,
I bought the 64GB version of this card to increase the storage capacity of my Samsung Galaxy S3.  I use it to store pictures and video which I shoot with the phone.  I have never had any issues with the card keeping up to the 1080p video that the phone shoots.Speed as tested on my Galaxy S3 w/ SD Card Tester:Write: 9.6 MB/sRead: 24 MB/s,
"great for listening to prime music, quick weather reports. volume adjusts quickly and gives status of battery on request.",
This was an exceptional deal...especially since they actually sent me a 64GB card instead of a 32GB.  Price is right. ;-),
"does exactly what you would expect, use this in my new galaxy tab and not disappointing as always a great product",
It's pretty cool. Integration with Amazon Music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company.,
I bought two of these for mine and my husbands phones. They work awesomely so far. Gaining access is quick and there is lots of space. I would recommend this product to others.,
"What can I say? It's the best price I could find for a 64 GB micro SD, and it works great in my Samsung Note 3. When I finally decide to buy a Note 10.4 or Note Pro 12.2, this 64GB card will be ordered right along with it.",
This is my second one and it is great! It can be used as a remote also. It was easy to pair with my Fire TV. I received my first one when I purchased the Gaming Edition of Fire TV and I liked it so much that I bought a second one for my son. He is a gamer and he was very happy with it.I would recommend this product for anyone who is a gamer. There are many more games available for the Fire TV and they play flawlessly on the Fire TV,
SanDisk makes some great memory chips for a decent price. I can' recommend no names brands because of their error frequency.,
I wanted some extra space in my new mobile device so I chose this SanDisk microSD card.  The card has worked perfect so far in my HTC One M8 for several weeks so far.  The performance of copying files from my computer over to the phone is adequate.  The performance is likely limited by the phone's USB 2.0 interface so I haven't done any tests with the card connected up to a dedicated SD card reader.,
"Love the Tap, plays my daughter' s music. Works well if you are a Amazon Prime member.",
"Soon as I got this, I popped the back of my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and put this in. The Note 2 recognized it instantly and I was able to move my mp3s from the internal memory to this external memory and was playing music in short order.",
"I'm so happy that upgradable memory exists.  I get to listen to a plethora of podcasts, music, and instructional MP3s.  Thank you SanDisk!",
"Using this on my new Samsung Ativ500PC, works well with fast data transfer.  Got here quickly and includes a standard SD adapter.",
works well with the amazon fire 7,
This is good item it works well on my Phone and I intend to buy more later. So I highly recommend this type.,
"stores a lot of HD pictures and videos. no longer do i have issues with SD card errors and losing my data. i highly recommend anyone buy class 10 SD cards for their devices. have had this for 5 months, no issues.",
SanDisk is the best brand to get for memory cards. I bought two of these little gems to go with my SanDisk Sansa Clip Zip and they work wonderfully.,
My Galaxy S4 16 GB phone is now at 80 GB.  This will give me more than enough room for my music and then some.,
"excellent product, very fast and lots of space.. I am using at Samsung galaxy S3, there are no issues, ..recommended..",
I bought this to stretch the capability of my LG GPad 8.3 GPE tablet.It is working just fine and of course I have total confidence in SanDisk storage items.,
"Love, love, love this! Can't wait to use it on our deck this summer!",
"4 stars for the excellent price and performance. Seems to be as advertised. Average copying speeds are around 18-20MB/s.Only gripe is that SanDisk doesn't include any extras - i.e. a plastic protective case, or bundle it with a SD Card reader. However, can understand why at this price point.",
"I do not get the advertised speed of 30MB/s, more like a 200-300KB/s on my Galaxy S4. At least it gives me a lot of extra storage space, for a phone it works nicely if you don't need to transfer big files.",
"I previously owned an Asus infinity with 10 inch screen until it died on vacation and I grabbed the smaller 8 gb fire during the one day sale. I could not get used to the small screen or lack of storage so here I am with the new 10 inch fire. If you liked your fire 7 you will love this. The 32 gb is sufficient itself for downloading tons of books, music, and a couple of movies and games but when you pair that with the ability at last to use a memory card (and it's about time Amazon makes a version that can do this) the storage is enough for even most power users! Set up is a breeze just follow the onscreen instructions. Within minutes out of the box I was surfing the web, checking my email and posting on Facebook. After charging the battery to full I streamed a one hour tv show from Netflix and when I checked afterwards the battery was still at 95 percent. I am writing this review on it right now. If you have prime you can download a movie to watch later without needing your wifi which is a big plus for me as we are in storm season here so when the power goes out I can at least watch a movie.",
"You will notice that your camera, phone will work a lot faster.  I was really surprised to see how much better all worked with this Chip.  You will be very happy.",
"I bought this 64GB card to use for photo storage on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. The phone also recognized the card instantly. This is about the best deal for 64 gigs I have been able to find. If you have a music library (or in my case pictures library) that won't fit on your phone, this card is for you!",
Nice product at a reasonable price. I use mine in a Gopro camera and it works great. I would recommend this memory for high speed action video as it works great.,
I'm not going to go into any technical specifications here.It's enough to say that this SD card does exactly what it is supposed to do.Reliable and secure. SanDisk is quickly becoming the gold standard for storage.A great product.,
"Ordered and installed Dec. 2013, it's been working fine since. Some quite detailed reviews here from others on bad experience in the S4, which has apparently been addressed, so seems to be all good now.",
"this memory card is ultra fast in android phone its a bit costly but it works flawless it  reads fast so pics, videos etc loads in bout 3 seconds or less  highly recommended",
It works as expected. What else is there to say? Plug it into my tablet in the micro slot. Slide it into the adapter and plug it into my camera.,
"I get about 3mb/s, and the formatted capacity is closer to 27 gb. However the extra storage is very useful, it has some quirks. You can't move anything to the recycle bin. It doesn't work. You have to permanently delete it.",
"I feel a little cheated, they state that this is the best for android phone yet it failed. I never even removed.i have had other memory cards last me years upon years.  Have to look for another one so disappointed. The phone moved smoother but not sure it is worth it",
This is a great card that works with the Galaxy S3 phone. I just put the card in and it worked.,
My Surface's disk space was very limited until I popped this in. It is a wonderful solution to the 64GB Surface Pros and with Windows 8.1 we will have even more flexibility when interacting with SDXC cards. The pictures and videos load just as fast as if they were on the native hard drive.,
If you want TONS of storage on your phone or device this is the answer. The card is also FAST I can watch an HD movie or shoot one with my phone with no issues whatsoever.I upgraded from a 32g card to this newer faster one and can really tell the difference. The faster cards are worth the upgrade price.,
OH my gosh this is the greatest invention since sliced bread. I am totaled underwhelmed and it works too. xx xx,
"Although I've owned almost every model of Kindle ebook readers since the 2nd generation Kindle that I bought in 2009, I had to think hard about ordering the new Voyage. I was very happy with my Paperwhite (the 2nd generation that was released in the fall of 2013), and as much as I wanted to try the Voyage, I wasn't sure I wanted to spend 199 on one. It became a moot point, though, when my wife ordered the Voyage, saying it was her early Christmas present to me. Now that I've had time to use the Voyage, I have to say I'm impressed. With hardware features like a 300 ppi display, LEDs that automatically adjust the screen brightness depending on the ambient lighting, and the user's choice of a touchscreen or sensors acting like buttons to turn pages, the Voyage is hands down the state-of-the-art e-ink ebook reader. At the end of my review, I'll give my opinion on whether it's worth upgrading from your current ebook reader.When I received the Voyage, the setup was quick (although you do have to go through a brief tutorial), and after downloading a few of my books from the Amazon Cloud and adjusting a few settings, the Voyage was ready to go. Here's a brief comparison of the Voyage and the Paperwhite:Voyage---------Size: 6.4x4.5x0.30Weight (wi-fi version): 6.3 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: Touchscreen plus PagePressDisplay lighting: Adaptive light sensor (automatic) plus manual adjustmentPaperwhite-------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.Read more",
This card is made by a good company and it works well. Its lightning fast and gets the job done. Its a memory card so not really much to talk about other than the fact that it holds info and accesses and stores info very fast..,
"Most of my reviews are positive.  This product failed (could not read on my device (a Galaxy S3) nor on my computer with 2 different readers) in less than 30 days.  The customer support is also unhelpful, as they would only replace the card after many questions, they would not provide a refund (I did not want a replacement of a card that failed so quickly).I would suggest buying a different card, it is not worth the hassle and lost data to save a couple of dollars with buying this one.",
Like a previous reviewer mentioned it is fabric over hard plastic it is not a snug or tight fit. Good quality though.,
"If your electronic calls for this size, you have to use it. But I hate it.  It`s too darn small to fool with. This one works well, but I will try to avoid this size in the futher.",
"I was surprised to see the main drive in my Dell Venue Pro 8 was almost completely consumed by the Windows OS.  I added this card to create some space for myself.  The tablet recognized it as an additional disc with 29GB available.  That gives me plenty of breathing room for what I do with the tablet, and the speed is incredible.  I am very pleased with this product, and will purchase another one when I upgrade the card in my GoPro this summer.",

Smaller version but works great just like the bigger product.,
This card is one of the fastest SD cards on the market. It works great for your Samsung Galaxy Note II. No issues with installation or device recognition. Highly recommended.,
I bought this for my mp3 player and it works great for moving music around. I like the fact it came with the adapter for card readers because cheaper ones don't.,
the only reason not to buy this one is to buy the bigger one. Ive had in my phones for over 2 years and is awesome. Never worry about running out of storage. Great product!,
"Purchased it for DATA2SD on my Asus Transformer Prime. It did a great job but eventually the tablet started slowing down anyway so I have replaced it with a Samsung Tablet, which I will use the SD card in it but as a regular form of storage.",

"never looked to verify the capacity of this card, it is clearly labeled 64gb but when installed it clearly is not. When installed into any computer it shows 27.4gb available with 1.68 used. So beware if you order one to make sure you are getting what you pay for.",
"Use it in my digital camera. I have a Nikon L100 and used to use a class 4 card. Burst mode can capture 8 photos but it would take almost a minute to save m to the card. Now, its a matter of seconds. Love this card.",

I have 2 of these cards and they both report the same speed.  My Kingston 8GB SDHC Class 4 writes at 11.854 MB/s.  Now keep in mind the Sandisk beats the other cards in the random reads and writes.

Great purchase nephew loved it.,
Got this for my new Samsung Galaxy 5.0.I can't understand why someone would buy a Class 4 for only 5 or 6 bucks cheeper than this Class 10 Micro SDHC.VERY fast 30mbs speed.Comes with adapter for PC.Been using San Disc Flash Memory for years with no complaints.If your using an Android device or anything that need fast data transfer this card won't dissapoint!!!,
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
Great buy for this SanDisk 16 GB memory. Worked well in my Samsung S4 smartphone. I mainly use the extra memory to save photos and music. Like the adapter that I use frequently to copies files to my desk top pc.,
"Everything transfered over to my new SD card fine, but now my phone will randomly lose the SD card and have to search and re-scan it. Tried another SD card and no problems. Now I can only get a refund since its out of stock.Updated 12/9/12-SD card will not not work. My phone or computer will not read it. Lost everything. I'd advise if you are looking to purchase an SD card look at another brand.",
"Purchased for use in a dash-camera. Have been using for 2.5 months now without any issues. Not sure what else to say about it, hopefully I get a couple years worth of use out of it.",
Purchased this product for a new 7&#34; Garmin GPS. The refresh rate is so much faster than on my wife's similar but smaller 5&#34; Garmin with class 4 memory.,

I liked both of them and I have to tell you that they have held up very well. One is over 3 years old and the other is 2 years old and I have not had any issues with them. Since I have not upgraded in 2 years I thought I would get a new one with a larger memory and a faster CPU and a higher resolution display. There are many improvements beyond even those features.I have to tell you that overall I am impressed with this new one. I didn't feel the need to purchase a Kindle Fire every year and when I purchased the next one I wanted it to be a definite upgrade step to what I had. I stayed with the 7 inch size as I like to portability and weight for long term reading. I alternate between the Kindle Paperwhite for reading in the daytime and at night sometimes and I use the Kindle Fire for reading in the evening and at night plus browsing the internet and getting email. This new Kindle Fire HD 2014 version is very fast and easy to use. Setting it up for the internet and downloading my apps and books was a breeze. I like the fact that the larger memory allows me to carry more apps and books. The higher resolution of the screen is helpful in reading books as the text is clearer and easier on my eyes than the older Kindle Fires we own. The screen is better for playing apps and watching videos and movies and it is worth the upgrade from the older Kindle Fires.I like that this version has both a front and rear facing camera. I use the camera a lot on all of my tablets and I own many Apple iPads, Apple iPhone and Android tablets.Read more",
"When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It's actually it's own device. Yes, it's portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same ""alexa"" set up. The Echo operates with no hands���you can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit.",
"Best 64 gigs of micro SD out there. No lag accessing data for the smartphone, acts like the phone's own internal storage and is indistinguishable from it. The integrity of the data is well preserved.",
"So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.Thanks for letting me rant",
"I bought this about 5 months ago, give or take. I needed if for my Galaxy S3. It works perfect.",
"I have owned a Kindle for several years now. I have had the 2nd generation Kindle and I have had the Kindle Keyboard. When my mom expressed interest in getting a Kindle I decided to give her my Kindle Keyboard because she doesnt have Wifi in her house and my older Kindle Keyboard had 3G, which is what she needed. And I decided to buy the Basic Kindle for myself because (1) I didnt want to wait for the Paperwhite to come out and (2) I just needed Wifi and (3)and most importantly I JUST WANT TO READ A BOOK, not listen to text-to-speach, or go shopping on Amazon, or listen to music, etc. All I want to do is read a book...thats it! This Kindle is perfect for that. Its smaller and lighter, the pages turn faster than the Keyboard version, it basically has everything I need to download a book and read a book with a much better price than the Paperwhite or Keyboard. Yes, you have to navigate through the keyboard on this kindle with a 5-way controller, but I rarely use the keyboard anyway. To download a book, I just search and buy books on my computer and send them to my Kindle...which is much quicker no matter what version of Kindle you have. So if you dont need, want, or use all the extras then I would definitely recommend the Basic Kindle for 69 with special offers, because who really pays attention to the screen savers anyway.",
"Start at four stars.Plus one star, because it's FINALLY a 128GB SD card.  I have been longing for this for quite some time.Minus one star because its performance is spotty.  I've been using one in a Surface Pro for a couple months now, and while the write speeds will peak at a sustained 15MB/sec, it often slows to 1 or 2, even in the middle of a large file copy.  I assume that's due to typical flash memory erase cycles or something, but I can't imagine it would be at all reliable for recording video to in your phone.In the end, I like it well enough to get two, but it's really only good for mass storage with low bandwidth requirements.",
Good item came well packaged and been working fine so far only thing is it will not connected when using the adapter when connecting it to My PC.,
The card arrived promptly and has worked flawlessly in a dashcam. Would recommend purchase to others if they need this kind of card.,
Use with my GoPro Hero 3 & class 10 is a must.  These are inexpensive & simply get the job done!  I own 3 & am considering purchasing 1 or 2 more....,
Bought this for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition. Was a little worried about it being the right one because the documentation was skimpy and some people had problem getting 64GB working.No problem! Just slipped it and when I went to settings it recognized it immediately.Nice having the adapter so can move photos and files to my PC when I need it.,
SanDisk is a great brand and it has failed. I have purchased several of these so I think it was just bad luck. I am sure Amazon will replace it.,
"Fantastic sound from such a small speaker, excellent! Not as impressed with its other potential capabilities- more difficult to set those up & get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather, order items, etc.. Wish it came with more pre installed I guess.",
"I haven't figured out yet if I'm a dummy or if I have a defective card.  I don't know if the card is bad since I can't even get the card to stay in my Samsung Galaxy S4.8.  The little card will go in (the larger one won't) but it won't stay in.  If I put pressure on it the Samsung says .. preparing SD card but as soon as I release pressure the Samsung says .... card removed.This card came from a source outside of Amazon and took way to long to get here.  It arrived in a white envelope with NO instructions.  I'm very upset about this purchase as I've never had a problem before with either SanDisk or Amazon.  I'll try to find someone with more experience than me to give this a try before I return it.  I would have expected this to come in a package from SanDisk, like other SanDisk products I've bought in big box stores or from Amazon but it did not.",
Works as expected! Can't complain about it has plenty of storage for pictures and videos! Will buy again when needed!,
Very good and quality memory with good functions. I received it in record time from the seller and so far i have not had any issues with the memory card.,
Changes the whole look of the Echo ... after i purchased i think i should have gone with the tan leather. But blue is my favorite color and it adds a bit of a pop to a mundane looking black disk! The texture is also really nice feel and look to it!,
"Received two today and they have ""Made in China"" imprinted on them.  Although they were detected and formatted fine to capacity in both Samsung phone and tablet, lets see if they hold up and not suffer premature death like many have reported.  Thinking I should've gone with ""Made in Korea"" Samsung SD cards instead if they had 64GB size.Update: Bought two 12/2012 and one year later with very light use one of the cards started locking up the phone with ""wait or close"" prompt when deleting files off of it.  Should've gone with Made in South Korea Samsung card.  Sandisk is garbage these days.",
Worked like it is suppose to on my Galaxy S3.  With this memory card now I have over 72 GB of storage!,
"Hard for my Mac to read. MHz be Mac, might be card. It's fast in a gopro, no real complaints",
I bouth it in order to extend the capacity of this tablet (64 GB).Now I have 128 GB on my Asus transformer Infinity...,
I really liked this tablet. Got it for my nephew who just turned 4. Has many built in kid rated apps which keeps him entertained. The bumper is a bonus in case he drops it too. What I also like is that it had another mode to switch to in case an adult wanted to use it too.,
"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",
"Sandisk never disappoint.  For a 64gin micro-disk, this thing is super fast.  Using it in my new Galaxy Note 2, Amazing !!",
"Bought this with my Samsung Galaxy S4 when it first came onto market and it worked for about a week then quit. All of the pictures I had taken originally and stored on this card are just gone, it was a bad purchase and after looking through numerous forums, hundreds or thousands of people were having the same issues with this card and the Galaxy S3 + 4, I do not recommend buying this card if you'll be putting it in a galaxy. I'd like to tell sandisk where they can put it.",
"Well i got it for my go pro hero 3. the hero 3 takes this instead of regular sd cards, it seems to be working fine and its the same type that go pro sells of of their site for the hero 3.",
"I use this for a Raspberry Pi, in the SD adapter, and it works so far.Also appeared to be the genuine part, although the prolific Sandisk counterfeiters have gotten really sneaky in recent years.I like getting MicroSDHC cards because they can be adapted to different device sizes.  For example, let's say I buy a used phone or e-reader that needs a memory card, and I'm not using my Pi -- I can just take the Pi's card, take it out of the adapter, and put it in the other device, rather than pay more money and wait a week for delivery of a new one.",
"I was shopping for a class 10 microsd for my gopro and Staples, OD, OM sells theirs for more than Amazon. Bought this and works well with my cam. Comes with a SD adapter.",
This is great. I use this with my Contour Roam camera. Works great. lots of room for video. Transfer speeds are as expected.,
"A friend gave me a Dot, which I enjoyed. I decided to explore the other devices. I was torn between the Echo and the Tap. After reading a CNET review, I chose the Tap because it is portable. My two frustrations are you cannot change the wake up word ""Alexis"", and you have to be exact in your language when requesting a service. If you are Amazon prime or Audible book member, it is a great addition to you household.",
"I am writing this from the perspective of being a long-time experienced Kindle user vs. someone brand new. From an overall perspective, considering the pricing of the Kindle with Special Offers at 79 vs. higher amounts for the different flavors of Kindle available today, this one is a bargain. If you have wanted to get your kids a Kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because 119 to 400+ is a lot of money to risk with a child, maybe at 79 this is your price point.From a size standpoint, the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e-Ink Kindles. It is slightly thicker - but slightly lighter - than the Kindle Paperwhite, but to me it's not really a noticeable difference when you're holding it in a protective cover.Opening up the box, included with the Kindle is a micro-USB cord but no power adapter. That's really annoying. Interestingly, and it seems rather chicken of Amazon, a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for 15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the Kindle (or 20 if you purchase it later), so if you already have a micro-USB charger handy I wouldn't order one of the chargers.There are no page buttons - no buttons at all except for the power button - and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you're reading, or swiping the screen with your finger.Reading is easy on this one: in comparison to my Kindle Keyboard, the previous version of Kindle, and a Kindle DX the letters on the screen are much, much darker and easier to read: the display is crisp and dark.Read more",
"One the better names in making computer accessories,  this works just fine in my LG Optimus G Pro, now I have 64GB.  I will purchase again",
This card is great for the price it's exactly what I ordered. Works great with my Samsung S4. Plenty of memory.,
"This is my 4th Kindle Fire, I also have the first generation, an 8.9 HDX and the new 6. The first thing that impresses is how thin and light this new model is, despite being the largest Fire to date. I love the more narrow, widescreen design of the screen, perfect for watching videos and reading books in portrait mode. Anyway, before I get carried away gushing, Ill just list my pros and one or two cons, to make this easier to read and save time.PROS:Wide screen design is perfect for videos and allows more text on a page for books.The stereo speakers sound incredible, even better than the previous HDX modelFor comic book readers comics purchased from Amazon now utilize the active panel reading mode from Comixology. I was wondering when Amazon was going to incorporate this feature for their comics, finally!Battery life seems to be similar to my 8.9 HDX, but Im happy with that considering the larger screen and thinness of the device.Considerably faster response time across the board.Finally! We can add a micro SD card to expand storage capacity! Yay!The camera takes photos that are much better quality than previous FireCONS:Would have preferred a rubberized back and case. The glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet also.Still deciding on the new software layout, maybe its because Im so familiar with the old Fire OS, but lets just say Im not blown away be the design so far.",
I am enjoying the Tap very much. Lot's to do and play with on the app. Still finding new things it can do daily. Great sound quality to play my music. I only wish that it had a better search engine.,
"I use this in my Dell Venue 8 Tablet. I have loaded it up with movies (MP-4's) and they playback flawlessly. However if it try to add a very large movie (4GB+) my windows 7 machine says that it is too large for the destination format. I shrink them down when that happens. Again, I am very happy with this purchase. Just wanted to point out a small limitation.",
Nice 32gb micro sd card. Using one in a Samsung S3 and another one in a Samsung S3 mini. Both phones can use the full storage amount and read/write seems fast. Comes with a nice little micro sd to sd adapter for easy use on a laptop for transferring files.,
"I've never had an issue with sandisk memory cards, and likewise.  Great price for what you're getting, memory is getting cheaper, and speed isn't a huge issue for me for smartphone use, so this was ideal.  Can never go wrong with sandisk.",
"I ordered this when I saw excellent specs. I thought only the micro chip comes. I was very well surprised when after receiving the parcel found out that it contains also the SD adapter which makes this chip usable in computers,, laptops, etc. BTW Amazon price beats up the same chip found at Costco for about $5 less.Copied the content of the older 16 GB micro SD card onto the new one, swapped the chips and here I go... :)I am using several Sandisk memory chips including compact flash cards for my DSLR. Excellent brand, fast, reliable, does not lse data or have write/read errors. Perfect!",
"it works, so far, waiting for the heat and cold to see how well it will hold up.",
"I just received my card, it is the class 10 64GB with the correct serial#SDSDQUA-064G-A11A. I received it in an unopened SanDisk packaging. I am going to use it on my HTC Rezound, I hope it works. From what I have read, it will work after reformatting the disk. I will update this review if I have any issues using it, if not, my rating will remain unchanged...",
"The last card I got was bad, but at least this one is working properly.  SanDisk is the best brand.",
All is as advertised and am enjoying Amazon Prime on the large screen TV instead of my computer monitor. Installation and operation a snap.,
"Excellent product, High capacity, well made.  Holds many pics, movies, and music...a gift to the camera buff.  I've always wanted a hi-capacity item by SanDisk.",
"it worked just like you would expect a micro SD card to work, no noticeable issues have come up yet.",
"When the wife's Macbook Air SSD got full, I dropped in one of these with a near-flush mount SD adaptor (also via Amazon) and set it up as a second drive for her iTunes collection. Now she's got plenty of room for pics of the kid.",
"I have this regularly plugged into my ASUS Transformer TF300T tablet as extra storage. But with the included adapter I can also plug it into my laptop. So I use it as a sort of &#34;sneaker-net&#34;, allowing me to move 30 GB of data to what ever I am using at the time. It is filled mostly with pictures and movies. The speed of this makes it convenient for transferring large amounts of data. I'll be buying another one of these in the near future.",
Put it in my Galaxy Note 2 and my Galaxy note 10.1 and it reads and writes perfectly. Will buy another,
I believe that this was a good price for this card its being used in a go pro without any issues.,
"Great speed, great capacity, great price, and fits great in my HTC Evo Design 4G Android phone. I recomend it.",
"Good card at a good price but I bought it specifically for my gopro camera. Even though its a class 10, its not fast enough to record on the higher quality settings. I guess not all class 10 are the same even among the exact same cards. You will need to buy the extreme version for gopro.",
"Sandisk is the premier brand in flash memory and this card came at a good price. Speeds are fast enough to work inside of my 1080p dashcam and has been running consistently for a few weeks now. Good brand, speeds as advertised, and reliable so far. No complaints.",
"Not bad, I doesnt feel any quicker than a normal 32GB card.  And you only get 27GB of storage. 20",
"I bought 2 of these, 1 to use in a StealthCam(with the included adapter) and 1 to use in my tablet(an Acer A500).  So far the card has worked flawlessly for both applications.  I chose to use the microSD card to make it possible to copy the pictures from my trail cameras using my tablet in the woods.  Removes the need for a dedicated viewer or to tote a laptop or extra cards.",
got as a gift and we love it,

"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
Very good card and still working now in my car DVR i love it and hoping it working for a long time for me.,
"SanDisk has always made reliable products, and this offers good speed, as expected capacity, and good price for its capacity",
This sd card works great! I haven't had an issue with it since I bought it and I don't expect to have any issues at all!,
I got this for my handheld GPS. It stores data not already stored in the main memory.,
"It's always good to buy on sale. The reason I purchased this style of Kindle, it's small , just like a paperback book, and very portable. So far so good. I'm enjoying every minute of use. The OS is very friendly user driven. Easy to navigate. Shopping, apps and books, is very easy. The user-interface takes a bit to get use too. If you are use to using tablets with iOS, windows, or Android there is a very short learning curve.The one aspect I like is the ability to group your items. Games, books, and the ability to make a new group. Keeps the confusion down.The clarity and speed of the Kindle is great. I'm very impressed by it's sharp image. I only use a wi-fi connection so the movies stream without a problem.Well worth the purchase on sale.",
I bought the Sandisk Ultra 32gb card for use in my Samsung smart phone.  Worked great for about 3 months.  Now the phone won't recognize the card & neither will my computer.  Just went unreadable one day.  Very disappointed in the reliability of this card.  Will contact Sandisk as it has a lifetime warranty.  Shall see if they'll stand behind their product.,
"If you're reading reviews of the new 3rd generation Paperwhite, you're likely considering buying one. If so, you're probably in one of these categories:* Never owned a Kindle e-ink reader* Own an older Kindle e-ink reader, but not a Paperwhite* Own a first or second generation PaperwhiteI'll save my opinion on whether the new Paperwhite 3 is worth buying until the end of my review. (But I will say this: They've taken a great product and made it even better.) First, here's a comparison of the new Paperwhite with the second generation Paperwhite (comparisons are for the wi-fi models):Second Generation Paperwhite (2013)-------------------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.3 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 212 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: TouchscreenNumber of fonts: 6Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lightingAll-New Paperwhite (2015)------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.2 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: TouchscreenNumber of fonts: 7Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lightingNote that the physical size is identical to the older Paperwhite, so covers and sleeves that worked with the older Paperwhites are still usable (thank you, Amazon). The most obvious difference is the screen resolution: 300 pixels per inch is a major jump from the 212 pixels per inch in the older Paperwhites.Read more",
item as described. fits well in my galaxy tab 2. can access instantly both from my tab and from my computer when I plug my tab to laptop by usb cable. I like it!,
"Works as expected.  What else can be said.  These cards are almost &#34;silly person&#34; proof, but looking at some reviews may say otherwise.  Amazon shipped it fast and I am happy.",
For its size this is a pretty well made product that produces great sound and I love the portability.,
"I bought this to store all my music on my phone, but it doesn't work. The phone has trouble reading from the card, and I keep having to reformat it. Buy one from Sony or some other company instead, especially if you have a GS3",
"I am a music junkie and I use my phone as much as a mp3 player and video recorder, then as an actual phone, that I chew up memory quick. Thanks, to Sandisk and my Q10 I can keep expanding my storage.",
never had any problems with memory from san disk.  quality good products.  buy again for future needs.  good for a long time,
I got this during Amazon's SanDisk sale.  It works like a charm.  64GB addon to my Galaxy S3.  Need I say more?,
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
"It was excellent for me in one moment when I was able to use it onboard cruise ship while ship was in international water with it's own 3G or EDGE cellphone network. Once they stop this way of using around 5 months ago, now I can use it only when I am in the states.",
works what more can i say . it went down 10 bucks the day after I bout it but whatever.  Great micro SD,
That's a lot of MP3s and photos. Works 100% with no issues with my 32GB Samsung Galaxy S III phone.,
64 gb of fast microSD storage at a great price.  What's not to love?  Works perfectly with my 64gb Dell Venue Pro 8.,
"had to send it back to SanDisk.  They did replace it at no cost - which is nice - but still ... if I had lost a bunch of data I would have been pretty bummed.  I used it in my phone to store music.  one day i turned on my phone and it said &#34;can't read card&#34;  that was it - i tried putting it in my computer to reformat, wasn't even recognized as a drive at all.",
"I've been an iPad user since the original came out. I also have an iPad 3. I have worked in IT for the past few years so I would say I am pretty good with technology and fancy new devices. With that introduction out of the way, I will be reviewing key points that I have seen touched upon in other reviews. Here goes...BUILDThe device feels nice and solid. I'm a little surprised at how heavy it is, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The rubberized backing is always nice for added grip. It's not as nice as say unibody aluminum, but it's not 500 either.SCREENThe screen is fantastic. But my problem is the same as when iPad got Retina Display, other than the OS, most apps look rather pixelated. A lot of the games I tried are not high definition, at least not high enough to look smooth on this screen. Hopefully apps get updated to higher resolutions.LOCK SCREEN ADSYeah there are ads on my lock screen. I'm not sure why this is such a big deal. How much time do people really spend looking at the lock screen The first thing I thought when I saw the ads is WOW the pictures are really crisp! The ads are there to subsidize some of the 200 price tag. I might pay the 15 to get rid of them so I can customize it, but I might not. I feel like this has been blown out of proportion by other customers.SOUNDThe sound from the speakers is great. Much better than you would get from more expensive devices, very crisp and clean. I have the official Amazon case on and it has not affected the sound at all. Nothing much else to say, I doubt anyone will complain about this.CRASHINGI've had two apps crash on opening. I don't know if it is the app or the OS. It's probably somewhere in the middle. Again, not a big deal for me.Read more",
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
I bought this 64GB memory card for my mini-camcorder.  Now I have unlimited picture and video taking capabilities.  No more packing extra memory cards for me.,
Solid performance and great transfer speeds - enough said. I strongly recommend this card just for being a class 10 and at a bargain price.,
I bought this to create a bootable SD card so that my Nook HD+ could run pure Android instead of the native Nook OS. It works beautifully.,
"I got this to allow me to store and move movies and photos.  It holds a lot and playing videos straight from the card works fine.  So, it does what I needed it to do.  You generally can't go wrong with genuine SanDisk products.",
"Was super easy to connect via Bluetooth - great sound, fun to use.",
You may  think that it is not worth spending the extra few bucks for this version of micro SD but trust me it is this transferred about 8 gbs of music in 10 minutes with the original  version it took about 25 minutes on the same computer. So it is definitely worth the extra few bucks.,
"Get a fast card for your gadgets, this is a class 10.  Higher the number the faster the read/write it is and sandisk is a well know reputable name.  I would avoid the cheap junk as if it fails then you've lost what's on the card most likely!",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"This is my 4th Kindle Fire, I also have the first generation, an 8.9 HDX and the new 6. The first thing that impresses is how thin and light this new model is, despite being the largest Fire to date. I love the more narrow, widescreen design of the screen, perfect for watching videos and reading books in portrait mode. Anyway, before I get carried away gushing, Ill just list my pros and one or two cons, to make this easier to read and save time.PROS:Wide screen design is perfect for videos and allows more text on a page for books.The stereo speakers sound incredible, even better than the previous HDX modelFor comic book readers comics purchased from Amazon now utilize the active panel reading mode from Comixology. I was wondering when Amazon was going to incorporate this feature for their comics, finally!Battery life seems to be similar to my 8.9 HDX, but Im happy with that considering the larger screen and thinness of the device.Considerably faster response time across the board.Finally! We can add a micro SD card to expand storage capacity! Yay!The camera takes photos that are much better quality than previous FireCONS:Would have preferred a rubberized back and case. The glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet also.Still deciding on the new software layout, maybe its because Im so familiar with the old Fire OS, but lets just say Im not blown away be the design so far.",
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
"If you like to see videos on tablets or phones, you'll end up needing this guy. And this is the fastest. Very good for recording too.",
"With technology improving upon solid state memory extremely quickly, there's no excuse to buy the best in speed, without sacrificing quality.Many 32gb cards are Class 2/4, which makes them very slow. If you're going to be utilizing 32gb of data for photos/videos, your phone or just super small storage, you're much better off purchasing a faster card such as this. The price is right, and even if it's a little more expensive than the Class 2/4 or even 6's, you will regret having pinched a few dollars instead of investing into faster speeds.I currently use this in my Sony Action Cam, and the write speed works perfectly for me, as well as the reading speed to transfer files off the card.",
"I would have rated this higher (4 stars) but I am taking off 2 stars for not having an 'off' or a 'sleep mode' button. It is supposed to go to sleep after 30 minutes but mine has not gone to sleep much since plugging it in a few days ago. So far it is only a slight improvement over my LG blu-ray players which allows me to watch amazon videos. I only see a few Interesting games so I will continue using my Xbox and my Kindle tablets until more games are available. For the price, I could have waited.",
"I bought this for my Canon DSLR. It works great, no delay in photograph shots. Also, no visible lag effects with video. Will re-purchase.",
"So far, so good - seems very stable - used in Logitech Alert cameras to replace the 2GB supplied with camera - extends recordings to a much longer history (months vs days!)",
"This is the card you want for a high end smartphone or camera.No trouble setting it up. Fast speeds transferring my old SDcard data back onto this one.Don't hesitate, this is it.",
super fast transfer speed. very very impressed with the price as well. I'll be getting another no doubt. Two Words.,
"Technically the best compared to others on the market, my complaint is that the selection of movie apps such as Vudu which I have a very large library and the lack of Cable apps such as HBO GO.",
Great. Love it.,
"I noticed that I was constantly running out of space on my Smartphone. I checked the SD card and it was a 16Gb, but was about 98% full with pictures, music, and applications that I downloaded over time. I decided to get a bigger SD card for the phone. I researched online and found that my phone will support a 32Gb card, so I bought this one. Works great! All I had to do was copy and paste (via my computer) all the information from the old SD card ot this one. My Smartphone picked it up right away and I didn't lose anything, AND now I have twice as much room. I think the only thing I had to reset was my ring tones (because the wave files I was using were on my old SD card, and somehow the link between ring tone and file didn't match up), but other than that, everything else worked fine.",
The micro SD card was very well made it had great read and write speeds and it added gray amount of memory to my Samsung galaxy s4. Really recommend this,
The space on this card is amazing.  Using this for a GoPro camera and it has been great so far.,
"This card has plenty of space and is very fast. It comes with an adapter which turns it into a normal SD card, convenient for dropping into the computer to offload data.",
I'm the owner of a bunch of SanDisk cards and have been using them for many years. This one I picked up for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and it works very well. The adapter is nice even though I have other ones. The packaging is bullet-proof. If you need a high-speed card then this SanDisk is a great choice. Good price on Amazon especially over box store prices.Highly recommended.,
"I operate a commercial whitewater rafting company and we buy these bulk whilst renting out GoPro's and selling the footage along with the card to the customer. We've never had a bunk card or any problems whatsoever over about 40 cards so far. I was advised by my gopro rep to be sure to buy from a name brand &#34;like sandisk&#34;. The adapter is well appreciated by the customer, not only because most people don;t have a port for the micro format, but also because microsd is so ridiculously small that its far too easy to lose.Have and will buy again.",
"I bought this on October 9th and didn't start using it for about a week after I received it on the 11th. Well two days ago it died a quick death, I can't even format it! So after all these years of buying SanDisk products I guess I will give in and start paying a little more for Kingston it seems as though SanDisk is getting to be a cheaply built product. You would think that a product this small and inexpensive would be able to be replaced without cost within the first 90 days but that is my fault for not reading the fine print so lesson learned. Buy it right and buy it once so go with something else!",
"Only 4 stars because I found it very confusing at first. I had a Kindle before found it very easy to find what I needed to do. The user guide didn't really answer my questions, but I persisted am getting used to it. I really love the backlit screen no buttons to push to change pages. At first I wasn't sure about the smaller screen, but didn't take long to get over that. I'm sure I'm just a creature of habit not very techy. All in all, the Kindle Paperwhite is great.",
"Had this item for a week or so now and it seems to be working fine. I haven't put it through any kind of stress or anything, just stuck it in my phone and let it do it's thing. So far, so good.",
Working flawlessly as it is supposed to.  I like the speed of the product.  The adapter case is also nice to have.,
"Works fine in my Sony RX100 using the provided adapter, but who would expect otherwise.  Bought the more expensive micro with adapter rather than full size SD so that I can move it to other devices that take micro SD.Prime shipping arrived in one day.",
Great additional piece to go with Echo. If you want a additional unit you can't beat this product and the price!,
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
"I've had this Kindle for a while now. Many of the reviews say it all so I don't think I could add much. But I feel like I need to speak on behalf of this Kindle to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought. If this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it. So I have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us allDo you have any clue what you bought Let's all say it out loud: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!!!!!! It is an entry level model with no light. Amazon has always sold non lighted Kindles, and I still have many of them. They are a cheap way to get into the e-reader scene. Can you read a real book in the dark Of course not. So these non lighted Kindles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light. It is ridiculous to buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because it doesn't have a light. Read the product descriptions. This Kindle has no light, the Paperwhite and Voyage do.Scream all to the heavens: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE PAGE TURNING BUTTONS!!!! To buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because your old Kindle had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane. Could you not see when you clicked on BUY that this Kindle had no page turning buttons. Sometimes I think there are two kinds of Kindle owners: those who want page turning buttons and those who don't mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page. If you can tell by my sarcasm, I belong to the latter bunch.Then of course there are the technically deficient that have no clue what wifi is, are unable to sign on, and blame it on the Kindle. BAM! another 1 star review.Read more",
"Installed this in my Galaxy S 3, no issues, put in, formatted and started taking photos, everything work fast and as expected.",
I am not sure what happened to these cards but I have owned several and they stop working quickly.  I sent a message to SanDisk and never heard back.  Very disappointing!,
"Works perfect, Price is perfect, Cant beat it! I bought this for my Galaxy Note 10.1 and I now have about 48GB total of storage!",
"The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more",
"But since I can't say with any certainty whether it was the phone or the card, I'll just say it's a middle of the road product. When it did work though, man it was BLAZING fast read speed.",
Had the 32GB SD Card for a 4 months before it died on me. Tried to swap it out and said warranty was only 60 days long. Last SanDisk product I ever buy.,
Was purchased to expand memory in a tablet.  It works well in my a tablet and can be used in a camera using the adapter.,
I use this to store music/video/pictures in my phone. Works well for that purpose. No hiccups or speed issues. Bueno.,
"I've noticed something VERY CROOKED online...postage scalpers! Charging $8 bucks to mail out micro sd cards that usually come in a small envelope? I mean COME ON! The FTC needs to crack down on these postage scalpers because they are working in FULL FORCE these days?I'd say a Micro-SD card should mail NO HIGHER than a $1.50 to $3.00 bucks but $8.00s????These crooks ARE DEMENTED! I've just been deleting orders out of my cart & will keep doing so till I find one that WON'T rip me off!Great products come  from Scan Disk but BUYERS BEWARE of these shops who mark these things with high priced postage & then mail it out in a small envelope! and YES almost EVERYONE I've ever ordered came in a small envelope BTW...Shame on you!

As my dad likes to say: There's no honest people anymore!ONE FINAL NOTE: Amazon & all of the other online outlets should stop allowing people to charge what they want for postage & only allow them to ship it at cost! a.k.a price figuring via what the item actually ships for at the PO,FedX &/or UPS!",
"This is called &#34;Class 10&#34;, so I ordered it, figuring it would have useable speed. I plugged it in to copy about 9GB of program installation files. I was totally dumbfounded that it took about 3 hours to copy those files onto this &#34;Ultra&#34; &#34;Class 10&#34; SDXC card. (9GB on my super-slow, super-cheap plastic school-kid USB thumb drive takes less than 10 minutes.) So then I tested it on various known computers with typical raw and JPG picture files. Read speeds ranged from 15-25MB/s, while write speeds ranged from 4-8MB/sec for big files, and below 1MB/sec for small files. This is what I would call largely unusable. VERY disappointing.",
"Nice product, perfect package and speed of recording. My camera will stay better with this memory. I recommend for all.",
This is perfect. A lot of people were commenting that the case falls off and it's not portable. That's not the intended use of the case. It is strictly for decorative use. It look great and comes in several color options. Would definitely purchase again.,
Needed a memory card for my phone (Samsung Galaxy III) and this works fine for it.  No problems at all.,
"Great price! Ultra rf has high speed and good stability, which is perfect for camera.I hope 64 g also drop the price.",
I bought a SanDisk SSD for my computer.  It's fast for the price.  I feel confident that anything I order made by SanDisk will be of the same quality.,

Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look.

"I feel like a lot of the bad reviews are from people who do not know what they are doing, or don't fully understand how to use the tablet to its full potential.

I love that about this tablet. Also, I can block the camera AND web browser so my child can't access that either! I can put a pass code on pretty much everything like profiles, WiFi access, settings, etc. It's really easy to set up and it came almost fully charged so I had plenty of time download what I wanted for my daughter and set it all up before I had to put it on the charger...

Worked perfectly in Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 with no additional formatting. Seems as fast as the internal memory of the tablet so no need to pay for more than 16 gig in the tablet if you buy one. Adds 64 gig of storage for less than upping the tablet to 32 gig. Fast shipping as always with Prime.,
Nice to be able to stuff 20GB of music and movie files on my phone. And still have room to take lots of photos and video.,
"I like Moshi's anti-glare screen protectors so much that the fact that there is one available for the Fire Phone is part of why I bought a Fire Phone. I've had these screen protectors on multiple iPads and iPod Touches over the years and they're the 1st thing I buy for any device I own (particularly those with shiny screens). I love that you don't have to worry about if you don't get them on right the first time, you can just pull them off and try again. I love that when they get dirty, you just remove it from the gadget and run it under water to clean it off and then put it back on your device.The Fire Phone does have a smaller bezel than the iPads and iPod Touches I've used with other Moshi anti-glare protectors, but there seems to be just enough that the protector stays on. (In case you don't understand how Moshi's screen protectors work: the only sticky part on them is where it covers the bezel-- the non-screen part of your device.)I also hate shiny screens and these protectors make devices usable which wouldn't work for me otherwise. So glad the anti-glare Moshi protector is available for the Fire Phone (for some other Amazon devices you can only get the regular Moshi screen protector).I've used this with the default Amazon cases without problem-- both the leather one and the polyurethane one. I just put the screen protector on first and then the case.",
"Sandisk is a popular brand name product, which I have used for years. I bought this for my new camera, for recording video, and it has worked well so far.. have not tried it with my gopro camera yet.  It may be a little slow for fast action videos.",
This is a very fast and reliable microSD card.  I used this on my Galaxy Note 2 and loaded movies and family pictures.  Transfer time is speedy!,
No problem with storage and speed. I only had some difficulties to insert it in my card Kingston reader: http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Flash-Memory-Reader-FCR-HS219/dp/B00109Y2DQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1356544341&sr=8-1&keywords=card+reader I believ due to a sticker covering something in one of the sides. Other microSD do not have this kind of problem with that reader.,
This card is a lot faster than my old card which was advertised as a Class 10 as well. Great to have the extra space too.,
Works well. Beware some of these SD cards are not what they say they are. This one is in my Nokia phone. Loaded maps and songs on it. No problem.,
This is a great up grade for me. I use it for my tablet and it gives me lots of extra storage. I would recommend to anyone.,
I bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale. I've been pleasantly surprised. Search sounds great for its size.,
Great memory card!  Can be used as a micro sd or regular because it comes with a the larger disc case that it fits into.,
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
I have this in a DROID X on Page Plus.  It works perfectly.  transfer speeds were good.  I have no complaints here.,
An SD card is an SD card. Unless its broken and I have had no problems. Keep up the good work.,
"Easy set up, tons of music, easy to use. If you are looking for voice activated, this is not it.",
Easy install in to the S4 and expansion of memory was completed with out issue.  Product works as it is advertised.,
I bought these for my ELPH 520 more for speed than space.  I wanted to use the rapid photo taking modes on the camera and wanted to ensure the SD card was not the limit at all.  The UHS-1 cards are supposed to be faster than normal Class 10 cards.  So far I've had no hiccups or issues taking super high speed video footage and rapid fire images.,
I got this card for the Samsung Galaxy S4. Installed and works without issue. Stores tons of photos and videos with fast playback and viewing.,
Does what it is supposed to when it is supposed to. Reads at 30 writes at 8-10. Perfect peripheral for my GS3.,
"First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory. It would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage, go buy a computer.Display: One word, amazing. Maybe I am pushing it, but the screen is so clear. I own an iPhone 5 and my eyes prefer my kindle. I love reading on this machine and for the price, amazon did a good job with this one.Read more",
"I really don't know that the complaints other posted were all about, but I have bought 3 of these sandisk micro sd card already.  for my phone, my wife and my daughter's phone. store lots of movies, pictures. videos....etc. all works just fine, no issues at all.",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"I really like the equipment. It is small and works well. The voice search feature is nice. Could have been a home run. Fire stars.However, not being able to down select to see just prime not so cool. Even the iPad app does that.... So one star for that. Go fix it Update your software",
"Works exactly as you would expect it to. Sandisk always makes great products that are of high quality, highly recommended.",
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
great sound easily portable around the house both inside and outside. the option to have it automatically respond without pushing the button was a surprise but a welcome one!,
I've used a number of these.  Just bought some more.  They're well rated.  they've always worked well for me.  Good price.,
"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",
Both of these items arrived on time and tested out at 9.8MB/s write and 19.8 MB/s read using H2Testw.exe.(500 MB file size). I would have given them 5 stars if the write-speed was just a bit faster.,
Works superbly with my Microsoft Surface RT. One of the best micro sdhc card you can get on the market for the price,
"This  micro SD is very fast, I use it in a Samsung Galaxy Note II and I don't have any problem regarding low speed.",
"I added this SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC to my smartphone, and it works perfectly.  Although I would not say that I &#34;love&#34; the memory card, I will say that I have no complaints about it, and I am perfectly happy with it.",
"spoke with customer service had it replaced 3 times, card had problems all of the times, they were all the time looking for ways to get out of the warranty until they decided i did something which obviously wasn't the problem because it happened 3 times with the previous cards, basically look into other companies that honer their warranties,very sad usually very good cards,they kept saying that Samsung updated the software and they update it in ways that it wont match the Sandisk cards.??",
It is ok for the price...but occasionally it has to be removed and reinserted or the device reports &#34;no card installed&#34; I think the contacts on these are a little flaky.,
"Big fan of SanDisk and even more so as the price of flash decreases. Can't compare to other brands as never has a reason to switch, Minor price variations do not compel to do so and performance/quality has never been in issue in many years of suing brand.",
"My Android tablet is a toy; there is nothing crucial on it. I plan on downloading maps for travel, and need more storage.I rooted my tablet, changed two lines in a control file, and now it sees the external card as the internal card (and vice versa). When I save apps and/or data to the SD card, everything goes to the 32GB SanDisk Ultra MicroSDHC card instead of the puny internal store! Woo-hoo!DISCLAIMER: Rooting a device usually voids its warranty. I am not condoning such action, nor am I responsible for the results of such action. The responsibility is yours.The tiny card fit into the tiny slot on my 9&#34;-screened tablet, and is invisible once installed. But we both know it's there! I couldn't be happier, and until that changes, this is my endorsement of the SDHC card.",
Loaded 2000 songs on this and still have lots of room left.  It works in both of my cell phones and my mp3 player (Cruise by Sansa).,
Used for two months in Samsung Galaxy.  Fizzled then failed.  I have never experienced a memory card or or flash drive failure until this SanDisk Ultra 32 GB.  Will purchase a different brand next time.  Return for refund or replacement is not allowed.,
This works with the NL1520.  No video stuttering like with the 64gb.  Blah blah blah blah to fill in the rest.,
I can take plenty of pictures and put all my music on my phone.  Works great for what I use it for.,
This is just what my S4 wanted! I have so many songs to take around with me that I had to get a bigger card and this one is great! No memory issues any time soon!,
"Amazing the best Amazon purchases EVER If you don't have one get one, really right now go do it you won't be sorry",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
Love it--so far--as I Just purchased this as Iam not into buying SDcards but now I have a Nextbook tablet and this works great for adding video's and music able to be put on this SD card.,
"what's not to like, works with my Nexus.  speed and capacity are fine.  no problems.  good quality and I'd recommend",
Great Great Deal!!!! I bought this for a Really good price ($25) after i bought my Brand New Galaxy S4. I looked in stores and found the same Micro SD card selling for $60-80. This works straight out of the box and I have had no issues at all with it. Buy it Now!,
"I'm into photography and I just got a gopro.This micro sd card is a class 10, it's great for photo/video and the best thing that I has, the price. I went to bestbuy, walmart, target, even a CVS looking for deals and BE AWARE, you'll find micro sd cards &#34;on sale&#34; but none of them -class10-. The cheapest I found a class 10 of 16GB was around $40.So be smart, get this with time and wait patiently.",
"This is the largest capacity micro SDHD card that will work in theASUS MeMo Pad Smart ME301T-A1-BL 10.1-Inch 16 GB Tablet (Blue). The card itself works great, but the adapter is defective. If I didn't already have another adapter, I would have to return this item.",
I have had this for about a year and it has worked flawlessly.  I use it add to the capacity of my MacBook Air and it has given me 50% more storage space.  Great product.,
I put this in my Nokia Lumia 521 and so far it works really well. I put my entire iTunes library on my phone and it all wrote on the card I believe in under an hour (I didn't keep track).My only regret is I probably should have purchased the 64GB card.,
"Bought this for my boyfriend, he LOVES it! He takes it on every trip we go on. It's so powerful for such a small speaker! I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",
Product is great. Does a good job at interpreting voice commands. Every once in a while it would have a problem with the wifi connection.,
Works perfect in my Galaxy Tab 4,
Bought this for my wife to use in her phone and it is fast and error free. Some cards do not show up with the correct size but this one does.,
"it just works great as it supposed to be, i would buy one more for my wife gallaxy S4, thanks!",
"Tha memory card works great, i havent had any problem with it, i recommend it for a gopro H3 camera",
"First of all I am not sure if the product i received is a CLASS 10 memory card. The reason why i say this is that the maximum write speed i get on my WINDOWS 8 system is 1.4 MB/Sec. Also i have issues with my system recognizing the card and i do frequently receive 'Disk Cannot Be Formatted' error.I am totally dissatisfied with this product considering the fact that i have a brand new laptop, Do not recommend SANDISK please check other brands.",
"I picked this up as a deal of the day.  No issues at all.  Put it in my phone, and then connected the phone (Galaxy S4) to the computer and dropped music and pictures in the folder and everything was quick and easy!",
"Perfect for my GoPro. The size is enough, and the speed (class 10) is what I need to have perfect records, and perfect plays. I don't need the adapter, but it cames in hand for use when sharing the images with friends or backing up on my netbook.",
"I wasn't sure how we would like the tap, but I must say it has been fun talking to Alexa. I like asking her to tell me a joke, play my favorite radio station or play music. The fun continues as I add apps and Alexa expands her knowledge base.",
"Priced right, this memory card also reads and writes fast. It's a noticeable difference over cheaper cards. I put it in my phone and plan to buy another one for my tablet.",
Great value for extra storage on cell phones. Adapter included with memory disk allows easy interface with standard computer card reader interfaces.,
"I've started buying all of my SD cards with the adapter. These is no reason to limit myself with having a large card when I need a small one. At first I was concerned about connection reliability when the small card was inserted into the large one, but I haven't had a single problem so far.This one performed as expected and otherwise is more flexible than a standard large size SD card. Fully recommended.",
Lots of storage space for my phone lets me have lots of music and roms.  Can't live without this card.,
Remote is a great addition......I Have two echo's and two dots which I use for my home automation. They work great. My only issue is that Amazon is no longer shipping the magnetic holder with the Echo. Felt this was a very helpful and welcomed addition which helped me organize my remotes safely. This is the only reason I am giving it 3 stars.....C'mon Amazon you are charging the same price as the older remotes labelling it new generation and eliminating the magnetic holder......disappointing,
"Item works, great price, what more can you ask for!?!?! Once again Amazon saves me both money and time. WIN",
This is the first of these I've had.  It works as mentioned and have had not problems with it.  Satisfied.,
SanDisk is a great brand.. never had a complaint. Is working fine in my Galaxy Tab 3 .. would recommend,
Really enjoy the interface and how integrate with the amazon music service .....great,

This review can not be valid due to the device did not work for me. I would put it down. Just upgraded to the ECHO instead of the tap.,

"I like the storage capacity of this little gadget. Purchased for use in my SmartPhone. SanDIsk has shown itself to be a truly reliable and quality storage device company and should do well in years to come.  This 32 GB micro  memory card comes with an adapter so that you can use it for other purposes.  They tend to be a bit on the pricey side, but you can't beat Amazon for pricing.  Go ahead, get one or two of these, they are a worthwhile investment, and you won't be disappointed.",
"We have had the full-size Echo for over a year, and I love it. The Tap requires you to push the button before Alexa responds to your requests, so that takes a little getting used to after using the big Echo's voice activated requests. The Tap speaker is not as good as the big Echo, but it is a nice portable blue tooth speaker that holds a battery charge. Overall, I really like this...and I found it at best buy for $78!",
"i just had an incident with my Galaxy S3 phone however where the chip became corrupt.. Is it the chip? Is it the phone?  I put one of these in my Samsung phone and another in my Samsung Tablet.  All is well except for that one time where the chip and phone got funny with each other and I had to erase all my music... The phone was able to format / erase / prepare the chip so it was immediately usable but I did lose my music.  Very weird.  Well, all I have to do is sync my music to my phone.. No big deal..",
This is a great piece of hardware...I love it. really good all around..,
This memory card works in both my Nook and my Canon camera.  I chose this disk because it will hold lots of pictures.  It was shipped earlier than expected.,
"I got the wrong one, plain and simple. It does what it says, and I like the connection to the internet to play music, but I should have gotten the Echo, I get annoyed at having to go to it and push the button.",
"everything about it was great, except for the adapter.  It was to tight i had to use a tool to take it back out of the adapter causing me to chip it. so my fault i guess, but i also bought a 16gb version and the adapter for that one was fine.",
"I am using this to add capacity to my Android powered HP Slate 7&#34; tablet, had to re-format to NTFS to work but then it worked great!  Note many devices will only work with up to 32 GB card only, check your specs before ordering",
What accolades can one say about an SD card that works and is an economical buy.  Put it in my GoPro camera and promptly filled it up.,
It does the job without any issue. I use it on my Microsoft Surface Pro Tablet. Fast and reliable. I would recommend it.,
"This is the fastest MicroSDHC I've used.  I got it for a tablet but it turned out the tablet had no MicroSDHC slot when it arrived.  So, using it for a 10.1MP camera.  It writes very quickly and then off to the next shot.  I'm quite pleased with the performance of this card.I think there may be cards even faster.  But this suits my needs of casual photography.",
"I wasn't expecting great transfer times like I get with nice compact flash cards, but this card is closer to those than the last generation of SD.  Wow.",
I have always used SanDisk products but this was a disappointment. It totally failed in my Galaxy S3 after about 8 months. I will order another brand but no more SanDisk for me!,
This ultra micro-sd card is faster than the standard micro-sd cards. However the adapter provided with the card is not good. Data Transfer was quicker when used with a different adapter than the one provided with the micro-sd card,

"Although I've owned almost every model of Kindle ebook readers since the 2nd generation Kindle that I bought in 2009, I had to think hard about ordering the new Voyage. I was very happy with my Paperwhite (the 2nd generation that was released in the fall of 2013), and as much as I wanted to try the Voyage, I wasn't sure I wanted to spend 199 on one. It became a moot point, though, when my wife ordered the Voyage, saying it was her early Christmas present to me. Now that I've had time to use the Voyage, I have to say I'm impressed. With hardware features like a 300 ppi display, LEDs that automatically adjust the screen brightness depending on the ambient lighting, and the user's choice of a touchscreen or sensors acting like buttons to turn pages, the Voyage is hands down the state-of-the-art e-ink ebook reader. At the end of my review, I'll give my opinion on whether it's worth upgrading from your current ebook reader.When I received the Voyage, the setup was quick (although you do have to go through a brief tutorial), and after downloading a few of my books from the Amazon Cloud and adjusting a few settings, the Voyage was ready to go. Here's a brief comparison of the Voyage and the Paperwhite:Voyage---------Size: 6.4x4.5x0.30Weight (wi-fi version): 6.3 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: Touchscreen plus PagePressDisplay lighting: Adaptive light sensor (automatic) plus manual adjustmentPaperwhite-------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.Read more",
"Sorry to say but I have to pull down rating from 5 to 2. The card went bad in just couple of months. No option to return as its beyond policy.The card came on time, good packaging and works so what else to add for this 16 GB SD card.",
"Works perfectly and for a fair price, it is immediately recognized by any device you use it . Good purchase!",
My wife loved it and me too because she take all the pictures and movies that want make and I don't need all the time ti pick out from the tablete.,
I don't know why I bought this but I'm glad I did. 32gb would of been just as good. I bought this considering I have a huge iTunes collection of about 28gb and would increase pass the 32gb so I bought the 64. Problem is since I have a playstation plus account I bought a Sony music unlimited at a reduced price of 12 bucks. Which left me having pretty much my entire music catalog in the palm of my hard without me wasting a single gb of memory. I still love the product and does work would definitely recommend.,
What can I say it's a SanDisk Ultra 32GB MicroSDHC Class 10/UHS-1 Memory Card Speed Up To 30MB/s With Adapter...LOL It work and is still working well.,
Using the card in a Sandisk Sansa Clip+ and it works! 4000 songs and counting. What more is there to say?,
I actually bought two of these items on separate orders and still using it daily with no issues. Beats the competition with quality.,
"We love this speaker for listening to music, the weather, news, or just anything. It is super portable and even has a hands-free option so it is really like a mini Echo!",
"Installed one of these in my Galaxy S4, nice addition. All my HD movies and audio files stream from this card, Perfect!",
"Got this card for my Surface RT, which, BTW is the worst tablet ever. No problems gets and it recognized it as soon as I put it in.",
Este fue una buena compras ha sido todo lo que esperaba del producto. Fue un bueno producto. Llego en el momento indicado.,
I use this card in my smartphone and it works great. It's fast and roomy (I got the 16GB version) enough to store all the music and video I need. It was immediately recognized by my Samsung smartphone when I put it in about 6 months ago and I've had no reason to take it out ever since.,
I wanted extra storage for my phone and this 16 GB is a perfect fit and the price was quite reasonable plus it comes from a quality manufacture of memory products.,
"I had this Sandisk 32Gb Class 10 micro SDHC card in a Pittasoft Blackvue DR500GW-HD in-car camera DVR. It worked like a champ for 2 months and then died with the dreaded ""Please format the SD card"" errors. Stuck it in my Mac Mini (2011) and it is unrecognizable. Same with Windows PC. Even the low level HP SD card formatter cannot reformat it. So in the garbage it goes. I have 2 more of these cards in my Garmin GPS devices and they continue to work (so far) but they are not being written to continually every day like the Blackvue. So a word of advice; if you need to write to these cards often - buy something else.",
I put it in my Samsung galaxy note 2 phone and have no idea how ill possibly fill it up,
"Great name brand class 10 card.  Great price, best on the net at the time I bought this one.  It works perfectly and is fast.  Can't go wrong.  Spend the extra couple of bucks for the real deal.  Don't be fooled by a knock off, slow speed, import.",
"very small size and huge capacity.Just what I was expecting to my cell phone.Also, I can use the adapter to download the information directly to my computer.",
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
Ordered this to put music and pictures on my Windows phone and it works perfect like every other Sandisk product I have purchased. Would purchase again if I need another one.,
"only can use 29g after formatted butwhat can you do, i still like it for my psp, works great fast!",
"When I received my new kindle, I tried several times to set it up. It would not work. I called service and worked with them several times to get it to work and finally your representive said the kindle had problems and I should just mail it back.",
Works well. Use in my Galaxy s4 as an expansion card. Works well. Have used and liked SanDisk cards before.,
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
"I bought this item based off other reviews and recommendations. Installation was extremely easy, and both cards (I bought 2) were shipped in perfect condition. Like others have noted: actual added storage is just over 29 GB. Buying via Amazon was a huge discount as opposed to local in-store options.Shipping was perfect. I would recommend this product to friends/family.",
My wife's 4 GB microSD card failed on her phone.  So in order to prevent any issues I got one for her phone and one for my phone.  We were able to transfer our photos and music over on to these cards with plenty of room to spare.,
I bought two of these for use in my HERO cam. I've had no problem with these and the video/picture quality is right on. This is a good value.,
We're in our 70s and and have a good time with it.,
"Didn't know I would like it this much, but it's wonderful. I use it mostly for streaming music from Pandora. I love that I don't have to rely on another device and connect via bluetooth like other speakers and the sound it great!",
"I've never had any issues with SanDisk, I always buy and trust their product. I bought this one for the Sansung Galaxy Note 10.1 and works very nicely. I wife loaded all her books and music on it and still huge amount of space left.",
Hard to know what to say exactly about a memory card except that it does what it should at a good price.  Storage case is sturdy enough.,
"This card is fast and flawless. Still have not been able to fill it up, and I do have a lot of music in it.",
"Much better than the echo dot. However, the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying. Speaker is fairly powerful for its size.",
"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysJuly 30, 2014Hi Dallas, thank you for sharing your feedback. We wanted to let you know that we made it easier to find your favorite Prime content with the click of your remote. You can now browse many more Prime-only categories, including Top Prime TV, Top Prime Movies, Prime TV for Kids, Prime Movies for Kids, Prime TV by Genre, and Prime Movies by Genre.",
Added lots of storage space to my new Nokia Lumia 1520. Very nice! The package got here very quickly and I was able to install it easily. The phone recognized it immediately. I did turn off the phone before inserting the SD. It came with an adapter that I didn't need to convert it from Micro SD.,
"Over the years, I've tried a variety of cases for the various models of Kindle and Fire tablet that I've purchased from Amazon. While I've found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive, I found myself coming back to Amazon's own product when I purchased one of their new 7 Fire tablets, and I'm pleased with it.This is a very good quality cover, it fits well, and it provides support to the tablet both in landscape and portrait orientation. It's made of fabric on the outside, with a microfiber inner lining to protect the screen of the tablet when the cover is closed. It matches the color of the Fire tablet perfectly.My only hesitation in purchasing it was the price - the case all by itself is fully half the price of the Fire tablet! But I suppose that says more about how cheap the tablet is, than how expensive the case is (kind of).Still, I decided to spend the money for this case. The tablet needs the protection and I know from experience that Amazon's cases are durable and will last for a long time (I've used my original Kindle Paperwhite - first generation model - with case since it was first purchased).I'll post some photos of the cover to show how it is packaged and how it looks on the tablet. I'm very satisfied with it.",
This was what I needed for extra space and to store more music.  This works great on my Samsung S4,
I bought this as additional memory for my ten inches samsung tab and i happy with it and noe have more storage,
"Excellent card that I use primarily in my carcam. Has also been used, and been compatible, in a small digital camera with the camera's proprietary adaptor.",
"Bought this for my Surface RT and it works just fine.  Also got it for $32, which was even better.",
"Works great, no issues. Tablet recognized it immediately and the speed is great. Lots of storage and no compatibility issues to report.",
"This is a decent tag along item to go with the Echo. It does the trick as a stand alone as well if a speaker and Alexa service is all you're looking for. Only downside is, if you also own an Echo, when you push the button on the Tap to speak to Alexa, since she is always listening on the Echo, she tends to pick up your commands on the Echo as well. Be sure to place the Tap a decent distance away from the Echo. Otherwise, this does what it's intended to do.",
"Alexa works great, but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible, your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up.",
"I have to assume that the brand new 64gb SanDisk Ultra Class 10 SDXC card is responsible for the occasional video recording stutter/pausing that has happened since I started using it today.  Prior to that, never had an issue with my previous SanDisk SDHC card.  But today on its maiden trip, it has led each video (only 3-5 minutes long each) to have several performance issues that by default I have to attribute to the card since nothing else has changed and I've never had an issue in the four months that I've had my Galaxy Note 2.  No problems formatting this card though or installing/using it otherwise.",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
Product arrived on time as expected and worked exactly as advertised. A good buy on a product that will be used as part of a surveillance system.,
"I have tested dozens of SDHC and micro-SDHC cards. One disturbing trend I noticed is that: the speed class rating for micro-SDHC is typically inflated. For example, a 'class-10' rating means the card must deliver a sequential write speed of at least 10MB/s. But somehow, a class-10 microSDHC cards is always slower than a class-10 SDHC card from the same manufacturer. Case in point: thePNY 32 GB microSDHC Card (P-SDU32G10-EFS2)claims to be 'class-10', yet it can only write at 8.6MB/s maximum, while the full-sizePNY P-SDHC16G10achieved 13.4MB/s according to CrystalDiskMark v3.01.ThisSanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 card (SDSDQUA-032G-U46A), however, proves to be the exception. It achieved a sequential write speed of over 10MB/s according to two different benchmark programs (11.8MB/s in ""CrystalDiskMark"", 10.6MB/s in ""H2testw v1.4""). This is faster than all my other microSDHC cards, including two 'class-10' cards fromPNYandPolaroid.A closer look at the file transfer speed using ""Flash Memory Toolkit"" revealed another nice surprise: For writing small files, this Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card performed just as well as its full-size counterpart, theSanDisk Ultra SDHC (SDSDU-032G-AFFP). In contrast, all my other class-10 microSDHC cards perform poorly while writing smaller files. See the benchmark results I uploaded to 'Customer Images' for details.When you use a memory card in a digital camera to record HD video, it needs to store a huge video file each session. That means its sequential write speed is most critical. When used in a tablet or a smart phone, however, the card's random write speed for small files is more important. That's why in such applications, the Sandisk microSDHC will perform faster than the PNY and Polaroid cards, even though they are also rated as 'class-10'.[Bottom Line]As of this writing, the Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card ia actually priced lower than other class-10 cards from PNY and Polaroid. This makes the Sandisk the best value - especially if you need honest class-10 performance across all platforms.[Side Notes]- Do not confuse this Sandisk Ultra card withSanDisk Mobile Ultra microSDHC (SDSDQY-032G-U46A). The latter is rated for class-6 only.- The size of this '32GB' card is 29.7GB according to my computer. This is actually normal because computer people count one Gig as ""2 to the power 30"", which is 7.3% larger than one billion. So 29.7GB translates to 31.9 billion bytes, which is '32GB' according to marketing people.[Update on Feb 4, 2013]1. Amazon combined the Sandisk Ultra 32GB and 64GB cards on the same product page. Please beware that your intended appliance must be compatible with 'SDXC' in order to used the 64GB version. My original review refers to the 32GB 'SDHC' version.2. There are two part numbers for the same card. If you start from the Amazon product page and select 'Retail Packaging', you'll see the part number of SDSDQUA-032G-U46A. But if you click on 'Frustration Free Package', the part number changes to SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A.[Update on Oct 5, 2013]The Sandisk microSDHC card works great in my new Samsung Galaxy S3, without the need for reformat (the default format is FAT32)[Update on Dec 26, 2013]My old test results were limited by the card reader and USB 2.0 port used. I re-tested the Sandisk UHS1 micro card using theTranscend RDF5 Card Readerconnected to an USB 3.0 port. Here are the results from 'CrystalDiskMark 3.01 x64':- Sequential Read speed = 40.0MB/s (was 34.8MB/s when connected to USB 2.0 port)- Sequential Write speed = 13.1MB/s (was 12.6MB/s when connected to USB 2.0 port)",
"I don't think there is much I can say about this little card/adapter. It was purchased with a Magic Wand Scanner that we use at work to capture images with a quick swipe across a wall chart/map. This card stores plenty of images, it keeps up with the scanner, the adapter works great, and it hasn't failed to store or transfer a image yet.",
Have had this probably 3 weeks. Wanted to be fair with my review. The battery in my Kindle Fire 8.9 HDX quit talking to the tablet so had to keep it plugged in to use it. Tried the Fire 8 first and just didn't care for how much smaller the screen was. Returned the 8 waited a bit and ordered the Fire 10. Amazon did give me a discount due to my problem with the 8.9. The Fire 10 in my opinion is no comparison to the 8.9. The apps with the 10 works more like smartphone apps. In the first three days it froze up 4 times. I wondered if it was doing this because I had too many apps opened. Once I started closing the apps I wasn't using I haven't had the tablet freeze problem. I do like the bigger screen on the 10 and the colors are sharp and the pictures clear. I also learned that the 8.9 was no longer being supported by Amazon and that meant no updates so eventually a replacement would have been necessary. Why Amazon stopped the 8.9 is beyond me but I'm doing ok now with the 10. If you get it give it some time.,
"I got mine from an electronics store, because I didn't want to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Setup was a breeze. I don't have cable, so prior to this, I had to hook my laptop up to my TV to enjoy Prime and Netflix content on it. I'm also really pleased that they added a YouTube app That was the number one drawback for me when considering this device. From what I've read, I figured I'd sideload one, but they saved me the trouble.Once I signed in to YouTube and linked my mobile devices, I even gained the ability to send content to my TV for viewing I don't have a Fire phone or Kindle (although I do have a Paperwhite), so I'm not able to comment on the connectivity with those.I can't say enough good things about this tiny box. I've had it for a couple of months and use it every day The user interface is intuitive and efficient. I really love the screen saver pictures, too. Most of them are breathtaking, and they seem to update periodically. The voice search is very accurate. There are a decent amount of apps for added content. I mostly stick to the abovementioned sources, but I added Crackle for a bit of variety.My only complaint would be about the rewind/fast forward. It's not intuitive, and takes some getting used to. I don't use that feature often, so it's no biggie to me.I did feel a bit weird about not being able to turn it off at first, but I got used to that, too. Just make sure to press the Home button when you're done for the evening or whatever, because you leave it paused in the middle of a show or something, it won't go to sleep. It remembers your place in whatever you were watching, so no worries about that.I look forward to continued software improvements, and plan on getting a game controller sometime soon, so I can try out the games.",
"Added this to my Dell Venue 11 Pro for extra storage space.  I popped the card holder out of my tablet, inserted the memory card and the tablet recognized it right away.  Read/write time is as fast as the SSD drive in my tablet.  No complaints here!!",
My niece was used to carrying around my tablet with a handle on the case. This one is not good for toddler to handle,
Many shows that are available on Hulu Plus website are not available on Amazon Fire TV Hulu Plus app. A message says that this show can only be viewed at hulu.com. Very disappointing. Example: Days of Our Lives.,
"I would not recommend this card if your looking for REAL class 10 write speeds. The most I could get is 9mb/s from this card but for the most part it was about 7-8mb/s. I even did a slow format to exfat in windows 7 with no improvements. I copied over music, pics and movies to test it out ranging from a couple of mb to over a gb. The read speeds were pretty good at around 21mb/s though. I popped in a 32gb class 10 transcend SD card and it consistently got 16-18mb/s write speeds and 24mb/s read speeds. So in conclusion I think this card is not really a class 10. Too bad I read all the negative 1 star reviews after the fact but I will be sending this one back.",

"First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory. It would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage, go buy a computer.Display: One word, amazing. Maybe I am pushing it, but the screen is so clear. I own an iPhone 5 and my eyes prefer my kindle. I love reading on this machine and for the price, amazon did a good job with this one.Read more",

If your not sure what card to use in your GoPro this one works fantastic. The majority of stuff Ive seen researching it points to these. With the exception of some issues with the 64GB. But I cant validate that and Im not sure its still a problem. Ive been using these for about 3 years now with no problems.,
Works well and is exactly as advertised.  I haven't had any issues with the product.  I am enjoying the extra capacity it offers in my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone.,
"I've purchased two of these screen protectors at ATT for my Fire Phones. Both have performed perfectly for me, unlike some reviewers' experience. The screens on my phones don't look fuzzy when the orientation of the phone is changed, the edges do not collect lint from my pockets, and the protector does not keep the case from fitting the phone. Here's what the protector does do: It keeps my screens from collecting fingerprints or skin oil. I don't know about the ease of application because, for both my purchases, the employee at ATT attached the protectors for me (I don't have the steadiest hands). Watching them, it looked quite easy to do. There are no bubbles at all and no more screen glare/reflections. I haven't had to remove, replace, or clean the protectors (except for wiping off the surface just to be sure it's clean because the protector doesn't show any dirt or oil).",
"I bought this for my Android device and it works great!It even comes with a converter so if I'd like to use it for images or movies I could!I'd highly recommend this product to anyone needing memory for their Phone, Android Player, Camera or anything that uses SD and /or Micro SD!",
"Bought this for my sons tablet, and it works fine. Sandisk has always been the leader in these flash memory cards, and has always been well worth the money.",
I got it and tested it block by block.  No issues.  I tested the speed in various applications and on my laptop in a good USB3.0 reader got no less than 4meg/sec and often a little over 10meg/sec.  Speed will (of course) vary depending on all the hardware and what you are transferring.,
"Edit 6/15/17 After three months of use, I still don't love it. It works well, no complaints, but it marks up easily and the sides began flaking off. My original black cover had shown signs of wear due to repeatedly falling asleep with it folded back. I was much more careful with the merlot, and it showed more signs after a shorter period of time. And the flaky thing along the sides looks and feels just cheap. And for 90, I would expect real leather. So I switched back to my original black cover and I'm just letting it age with the device. I guess the plus side is that the merlot made me like the black cover more, but the downside is it cost 90 to do so. Ridiculous.As stated in the title, I love my Oasis. I've had it for about six months and, with the exception of the defective first one I received which was promptly replaced, I haven't had a problem out of it. I had gotten the black cover because black is my default choice, always. However, a couple of months ago I had gotten a screen protector and skin for the Oasis, and I just wasn't feeling the black cover anymore. I had considered the merlot (I think the walnut would feel nicer to the touch, but I despise brown leather) so I gave in after much consideration and ordered it. It didn't arrive with the bundle of things that it was supposedly shipped with, but after a quick call to customer service I had a new tracking number. It finally arrived today. I am disappointed to say that I don't love it. It smells funny, as I done remember my original doing. The color is duller than in the picture. Maybe my expectations had overblown due to the wait and the whole two tracking numbers thing, but I just don't love it.Read more",
"The case that came with my Oasis had an edge that wasn't quite glued down. Amazon replaced it without difficulty and the new case is flawless.It detaches from the Oasis quickly and easily. I pull the Kindle off when I'm holding it one-handed and pop it right back in when finished.My only complain, which is a minor one, is that the felt inside cover can collect dust and dirt. But I don't know that there's a better way to construct it since the interior needs to be soft when it rests against the screen.In any case, it's a brilliant bit of kit, and I would buy another in an instant were anything to happen to the one I have now.",
"Im using this on my HTC Inspire 4G works well, copies extremely fast, and no lag on Video Camera App. Worked right out of the box when installed in my HTC and can now enjoy HD Video instead of pixelated youtube quality. SD Card Adapter works too; no problems. Extremely recommend for such an affordable yet genuine Micro SD Card.",
Works just fine. Haven't had any issues. Bought another 32gb micro sd mini but haven't used it yet. So far I'm pleased with the purchase.Ordered the hassle free packaging and the card seems legit. Decided to order the retail packaging for the other card since I read stories about fakes being shipped to people.,
"There are a lot of other reviews on this memory card. My only addition is that it worked perfectly the moment I put it into my S4; no formatting issues, nothing ... it just worked. Also nice that it comes with an SD adapter.",
"This is a great controller for our Fire TV, I purchased 2 of them, with two problems but let me first talk about the good. The controller works well for most of the games we play on the Fire TV. It has a long range compared to other controllers Ive tried (solid at 30 feet) and uses WiFi Direct instead of Bluetooth. The feel of it is decent (not too rubbery) and none of the buttons, D-Pad, or sticks have stuck or given us a problem. The microphone on it works as good or better than the one on the Fire TV remote.Now on to the problems. Its such an issue that Im not just putting it in the cons section but am going to tell you a bit about it. The worst problem is the battery life! In fact, its such a huge problem that Im taking off 2 stars because of it. This controller eats batteries like nobodys business. I have tried regular AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), expensive AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), and rechargeable AA batteries (Ive tried Energizer, Apple, AmazonBasics). The controller doesnt drain the batteries completely, nope. That I would understand. Instead, the controller stops working after only a 40 drain. I kid you not. Every set of batteries I have put into this thing has stopped working when there is still 60 battery life left. I have tested each set, before and after, using a generic battery tester as well as an ohm meter.The second problem may not be the controller itself, it may be the Fire TV, but its affecting the controller. The controller randomly disconnects. Not often enough for it to be a huge issue but just enough for it to be annoying. I have seen reports of others having the same problem with the controller and the remote. Im hoping that this issue will be fixed with a firmware update.Read more",
My young kids all filled their tablets with games and needed some space.  These worked just fine.  I like SanDisk.  I would buy stock in their company but I am not a gambling man.  Good ratings on the transfer speed too might I add with it being a class 10.,
"When I decided to purchase the Kindle HDX. I had been looking at several tablets closely for the past few months to use while I was away from home on an upcoming trip expected to last few weeks. And seeing the current price and purchasing options available the Kindle HDX seemed to be an easy choice to me. Even with my thinking I understood the tablets limitations.The things that attracted me to the Kindle HDX tab, were the processor, it's 4 G LTE compatibility with Verizon, and the fact that I am an Amazon Prime member. I had read that Amazon was expecting people to use their online services for video and music so having membership I was not too concerned about the small amount of storage on the tablet. But that was a mistake on my part. I was thinking I would be able to access the movies that I purchased online with Amazons instant video, and expected to be able to access the 128 gigs of music I have stored on Google Play, but Google Play media will not load on my Kindle HDX. Amazons cloud does store music up to a point, but it is limited in how much you can store free of charge. There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about 25 a year with other limitations). But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing. So now I'm forced to either purchase additional space or be satisfied with what's there. Personally I feel the additional 25 is a rip off since particularly since the purchase of the kindle and considering my Prime membership, and with other services offer free unlimited uploads of music Amazon seems pretty greedy at this pont.Here are the things I like about the current Kindle HDX Verizon compatible version.1. The processor, it is very fast and loads pages quickly, and the 2 gigs of ram is a respectable amount to assist in performance.2. The variables in personal settings, make the device easy to personalize.3. The display is very nice and video and video games look great, but noting as others have there is a blue cast around the edges which is very noticeable when reading from the device.The not so great things about the Kindle HDX 16 GB.1. The fact that the device does not support storage expansion. It bothers me that my old Droid Bionic cell phone has a SanDisk slot that will let me to expand storage to 64 gigs, but you're stuck with the memory provided on the Kindle you purchase.2. The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3. The Lack of even a mini USB port. Again my old Droid telephone provides a USB port and offers a charging device with a built in USB hub that allows me to connect to any number of external attachments, and this tablet does not.Regretfully the impact of these limitations did not come to mind when I bought the Kindle, but would have if I knew the fully understood the tablets limitations.Would I recommend this tablet to friends or family Only if they were a member of Amazons Prime services and fully understood its limitations, including storage and the area support of their carrier.So over all, for basic users or those wanting a reading device with very nice options living in an area with Wi-Fi and who have good 4 G coverage the Kindle would probably be an OK purchase. But only if they are fully aware of the limitations of this tablet. Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage. 16 gigs is just too little to carry much media with you, with the device using a large part of that 16 gigs, for it's UI and OS you are not even getting a full 16 gigs (more like 10). Then tablet not supporting SanDisk memory expansion (which seems contrived to me), leaves the user too dependent on Amazons premium services for my tastes.(Update 4/14/14) The packet blocking used to keep people tied to Amazons Media Content (or at least their Music App) needs to be removed. In my review above, I mentioned that I have had issues accessing my music stored on My Google Play Music site. But at that time I wasn't sure that this was my being impatient, not waiting for the site to load completely even though I did wait for five minutes, or if it was Amazon using packet blocking and redirection to keep people tied to their services. More recently I found that when trying to access my music on the Google site I was redirected to the My Books Recommendations. I believe the Kindle site offers better deals, and has a wider selection than Googles offerings, but Googles music site includes downloads at the same cost and higher resolution (320 Kbps vs. the 190-240 Kbps at Amazon). More over recently a few friends told me they have run into the same issue when trying to access their media stored at other various sites (that are either free or that do not charge what Amazon does for their Premium Cloud Services).As someone else has mentioned in their review of the Kindle. Amazon has included adds on the Kindle HDX that are not present on other tablets (even basic inexpensive Android tablets do not have invasive adds). If I pay Amazon another fee I understand I can have those adds removed. But all of these fees really add up, and it seems to me that since I've already paid for this device, these additional fee's, and packet blocking with proprietary redirection are unacceptable and possibly illegal. Who Gives amazon the right to block content and force you to view advertisements on a device of this natureAt this point I would honestly suggest looking elsewhere unless your absolutely sure that the problems mentioned above will not come into play for you or the one you are purchasing this device for. The idea of an e-reader with expanded abilities is one thing, but to advertise the Kindle HDX as a tablet able to compete with an I-Pad, and then throw things like site redirection, packet blocking to limit access media storage to their proprietary services makes me wish I had purchased anything other than this device.",
Not a lot to say about this memory. Sits in my S4 phone with no issues. Does not appear to have any lags.,
"You need to format this card to FAT32 before using it in your cell phone, otherwise it will not work. My Samsung Galaxy S3 kept giving me beef until I did so. It's handy to have a laptop sitting around that has a port that can take this card with its adapter in.Luckily I had one such laptop lying around. Otherwise, this card works great and holds quite a bit of space. Giving it 4 stars for the initial grief with formatting it. IIRC I used a tool called Fat32 Format, but it's on my laptop so I haven't checked.",
"I bought this memory for my Microsoft Surface RT. It works great and it is super fast. I am storing movies, music and pictures. Great!",
I absolutely love my amazon echo. It is very convenient and handy.,
"Originally got the walnut cover with my Oasis. It's very nice, and I would describe it as a suede material. For me, the walnut cover didn't age well. Lots of scratching, which is' necessarily a bad thing, but it also seemed to darken a bit which made it a bit dirty. The merlot cover is also very nice and ages a whole lot better. After some months of use, it looks as good today as when I first bought it. Oasis covers in general are very functional. The 2nd battery in the cover is genius. Since I found I really like reading my Oasis without the cover, I love the easy on/off design of the case.",
"This San Disk Micro SDHC is perfect for today's small electronics that need extra storage, such as smartphones, tablets, and cameras, etc. I've purchased several of these and this brand/version, is among the best. While Amazon usually has great prices on these, make sure you check out sales, especially at Radio Shack, which often beat all others. (No, they don't pay me; I just like to pass along info on good deals when I spot them.) FYI: Radio Shack's sale prices on no-contract smartphones are usually tops as well. I bought my Virgin Mobile Samsung S2 from them and am loving this phone!Back to the memory card, it's so nice to have Android products that take these to expand memory, something the ""I"" guys could really take a lesson in. And if you don't think you'll need the expanded memory, trust me, with photo-taking and all the goodies you can get, you'll want it over time.As one person commented, yes, this memory card comes in various sizes, including the 32GB version I also purchased, which is the max compatible with the devices I have, although 64GB is also available for the latest tech. All this is amazing to this old-timer, whose first desktop PC hard drive had only 500MB storage!",
Just wonderful. Perfect for my new phone. Does what it is designed to do. Fits in fine. Works very well.,
I have always been satisfied with sandisk products this memory card did not disappoint with it's fast reading and writing ability Sandisk has done it again.,
This microSd card works well with my mobile phone and tablet PC. It was delivered to me in a speedy way than I had ever expected. I love it and would recommend it to my friends.,
Bought it for my gopro hero3 camera (silver edition).Working without any problems. Fast!Was pleasantly surprised of the good quality Memory Card Adapter! Now can turn it into my laptop directly.,
"My primary concern is the price when comparing to other solutions. Nevertheless, has received the and installed the product I believe that I meets my specific needs and expectation. This case is unlikely to protect my Fire HD in a 5-foot drop. It does, however, protect my kindle from spills and low drops. What I want and what I have is the ability to, without forethought, turn off the Kindle when the cover is closed to save power. Moreover, whether by design or oversight the fact that the SD Card is covered (e.g. you need to remove the case to access the SD slot) this is a good thing. All in all I am impressed with product 's fit (e.g. the camera hole is perfectly aligned.), the tablet speakers are well positioned for audio and the case folds into both landscape and portrait support positions,Bottom-line I'm happy with the purchase and can recommend it to others for consideration.",
Works really well in my Motorola Razor MAXX. Good price for the size of this SD card. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I can't wait until the prices drop more and the capacity goes up.,
As to be expected this SanDisk works as advertised in my Garmin 850 GPS. I am satisfied with this product.,
"These things hardly go wrong, last forever, the bigger the better!With  SanDisk's  long-standing reputation,  at the right price point ( preferably at least $0.75  per GB or lower),  prIices can only continue to drop as technology improves.Not much to think about really. if you need the space, at this price,  you've hit a sweet spot for the moment.Great thing about micro SD cards  is their versatility.  You can stick it in your camera,  then stick it in your phone to review &  share. Tge speed  of these cards &  price/capacity  used  to be a problem. No longer. Now just watch the price of 64 GB cards  as the next level of resistance.Order was delivered on time,  price was right,  it's humming away reliably in my phone at the moment. What not to like?",
THESE MICRO CARDS ARE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND YOU CANT BEAT THE PRICE!!!!!!!!! IVE LOOKED AT ALL THE STORES AND NOONE BEATS THIS PRICE,
"Have ordered a couple of these 16GB class 10 microSDHC UHS-1 cards and they've done well by me. High transfer speeds, nice adapter, and no problems so far. Works with android phones/tablets easily, windows and mac machines so far from my tests.",
"First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory. It would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage, go buy a computer.Display: One word, amazing. Maybe I am pushing it, but the screen is so clear. I own an iPhone 5 and my eyes prefer my kindle. I love reading on this machine and for the price, amazon did a good job with this one.Read more",
"This little speaker is way better that her mother. after that update making it hand free, i recommend to anyone.",
you cant beat the price and it works great . I have no problems with the card I use it for my gopro it works great,
Not a great deal to say about this. SanDisk is a reputable supplier and it was simply a plug-and-play installation for the phone. It is a memory card and it works.,
"Replaced 16 gig in my android phone, motorolla atrix 2.  Works great.  No issues.  Been going strong for months now.",
"I purchase almost everything with the exception of food from Amazon. I have been a prime member since the inception of the program. Without exception, I have always received EXCELLENT customer service. Until now. I'm having difficulty with my Fire TV connecting to my wifi. Last Saturday I spent approximately 1- hours (maybe 2) troubleshooting with two women techs on the phone. Mary (who I was passed to from the first tech because of her expertise) said she thought it wasn't just a problem unique to me and asked me if she could call me back on Sunday after researching the problem. I had no problem with that. No call on Sunday so I called on Monday. Much to my surprise, there was no record of my call attached to my file. The rep was confused as to whether I was talking about fire wire or Fire TV so I was first sent to a different department. Finally, I got through that fire wire was not the same as Fire TV and I was transferred back to digital. We went through the same troubleshooting taking up a lot of my time. I was willing to do it until we were going around in circles and my phone was running out of juice. The gentleman asked me if he could research and call me later in the day. NO CALL. It's Tuesday--still no call.It really pains me to have to say anything negative about Amazon's Customer Service as it has NEVER BEEN LESS THAN EXCELLENT IN THE PAST. I've noticed I haven't gotten a survey as I usually do after a customer service call. Whoever Amazon has farmed out their digital customer service to will ruin their excellent customer service reputation and they will lose sales because of it. I'm going to wager a bet that there is no record of the 3-4 hours of my time on the phone trying to solve a problem and no record of two promises to call me back. I would have had more respect for these reps if I had received a call saying they were sorry, but they weren't able to come up with a solution for me.I'm hoping Amazon has kept a record of my past reviews and will review my account and see just how much I've spent over the years as a loyal customer. I'm very disappointed that I had to write this review, and I'm hoping someone who can change things reads this and saves Amazon's reputation. I can't be the only one receiving this kind of treatment. It's obvious that the people who are techs for Fire TV are not the same techs that I've dealt with in the past. In fact, I don't think they are even in the same country. What a pity.",
"I used this in a Roku 3 video streamer. Yes, at this point, the Roku 3 will NOT take advantage of the size, but may in the future. Also, the price was right.",
"I bought this on August of 2013.  As of April 2014 the card stopped functioning.  It can still be read, but the writing capability is gone.  That's less than one year.  I'm extremely disappointed in the longevity of this card.  My usage of it has been on my Galaxy S4.  I have about 40Gb of data in it.  Guess I'm going to have to look for another card that has a longer lifespan than this one.",
"great deal fast data good price . you can use it for any thing . you dont need card reader , it comes with one already",
This is so easy to operate and fun too! I love it!!,
"Excellent, quality item.",
Have been using this non stop for 6 months without any failure or problems. It is the fastest one that I have been able to find and all of this in a tiny little microSD.,

"Fast data speeds, large capacity and worked right off the bat in my Samsung SIII. Love the fact it holds my large music and audio books library on the device.",
"This was an inexpensive way to get my Galaxy Note II from 16GB to 32GB of memory. Its plenty fast and can hold lots of photos, music, etc.",
I inserted the 128gb Microsd card and it works great. I didn't even have to format it. My tablet see 119gb which is still good. Once I read the reviews about the card it made me think second about it. SanDisk fixed all the issues they had in the previous years to the point where all I have to do is stick the card in the slot and the space is available. GREAT JOB SANDISK for listening to people's complaints and fixing issues in the past.,
Bought for android tablet. The best part of Android is adding these. Works great own 4 of these!,
Got this very fast from Amazon and its fast glitch free performance for any smart phone or tablet - Ive used it in both and whereas I thought my atrix 2 was glitchy this solved the problem with hanging up screens and slow access to music and syncing.,
"The Ultra micro SDHC was fine once I got it working. Neither the packaging nor the Sansa Clip player inform the user that the player needs to be totally off before the microcard is inserted. If not, the unit will not read the card!  Otherwise? Love it and the storage for even 16 GB, let alone 32, is tremendous...",
"First off, companies need to mark these right, they consider 1000mb to be 1 gig, when 1 gig is actually 1024 mb.That means you will end up with 62 gb &#60; and in all actuality it will read as 59 gb in your device &#62;other then that this card works awesome. I would highly recommend it!one star lost due to them not knowing how to measure data.",
Sandisk quality has failed me. Moving on to another brand. I've had three of these memory cards fail on me in very short order.,
Great speaker and the sound is great. Use it every day. Love being able to use Alexa when attached to my network.,
"It worked in my android phone and will hold all my music, so i like it so far and would recommend",
"A micro card that has 64G still just blows my mind. I put this card in my Galaxy Tab and I love it. It gives me plenty of storage for my music, videos, movies, photos, etc. The speed is awesome too. That makes uploading to it that much more enjoyable. I recommend it.",
I am loving it so far.My Samsung Tab loves it too. :DIt seems to be going pretty smoothly.,
"I love my kindle! I got one for my fiance on his birthday, he loved it!!!!!!! so I decided to get one for myself as well and I am glad I did. It is very easy to read books in it. I LOVE the dictionary on this little device. Normally I just skip a word I don't know the meaning of and try to guess what it means in the context but with kindle, I just press and hold my finger on the word I don't know and translation pops up! so essentially, the meaning of a new word is at your finger tips! )If you love to read books, I highly recommend kindle.However, if you only read Manga or Comic books, if you are a fan of buying how to draw, how to sew books I do not recommend kindle for you. It is not easy to navigate trough pictures and slides.So if you are a fan of reading novels just buy it now!If you are a manga fan, just buy your manga books from bookstores.",
This thing works perfectly. I've hand no problems with SanDisk and this SD card rocks. Why can't they have phone with this much storage internally?,
I bought 2 of these one for my phone and the opther for my tablet. you cannever have enough memory,
"We ordered two of them, one for me and one for my sun.We use them on our Galaxy 3 phones and have never hada problem.  I never worry about space on my phone now.",
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
It does what is expectected. I bougth it to use with my GoPro and it works perfectly! I recommend it!,
Now who would have thought one day a memory card would be so small that its so easy to lose.I bought this MicroSD card to run openBSD on my beagle bone black:[...],
"Works great and faster than a conventional memory card. videos, pictures and access run smoother. highly recomnended for those who are in need of great space.",
"When I first got this card, it worked perfectly in my Galaxy S3 phone.  Then, I rooted the phone and installed the Cyanogen Mod ROM to gain additional features not available from my carrier.  The card was instantly corrupted by that ROM, because it's formatted with a filing system the ROM doesn't support.  Fortunately there was nothing on the card I couldn't replace.I ended up having to use a third-party utility to format the card with a filing system supported by both Windows and the ROM.Once properly formatted, there have been no corruption or data loss issues and the card has performed well.If you are using a stock Galaxy S3 ROM, you'll have no problem at all.  You'll find the card roomy and fast.",
No problem in using it to store medium res video for my kid's android device. Works as expected and as described.,
"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more",
"64GB for this price is a nice deal, especially when you are trying to add storage capability for a tablet or phone.  Keep in mind that not all phones/tablets/devices support 64GB, so you may have to get the 32 GB instead.  Performance is very good, especially when weighing with price and capacity.",
great price for a great product. I purchased for my phone but I can also use in my camera. NO issues so far and for the price you can not beat.,
"I can't give that much feedback on this because I ended up returning it. I was looking for the ideal memory mircoSD card for a GoPro and found a better model. I did end up filming one event on this card, and it did pretty good. It did end up lagging after some time though, just briefly.",
"Its like having my own personal cloud, So much storage in such a small item. This came at a great price and was in an easy to open package that made it easy to open and use right away. I ended up using it in my smartphone and when the screen cracked, I was able to back up everything to it and remove the card and put it in my laptop.",
"This card has performed flawlessly so far. No read or write errors, or speed problems. Not much more to say, but I had to fill up the Amazon word count.",
"Got this for my Galxy S3 - had another brand that the phone kept losing contact with and that corrupted a few files.  Much faster transfers with this - I got the 64GB version for my  Note 10.1. As always, super-fast shipping with Amazon Prime.",

This memory combined with the elago mobile nano II USB 2.0 works like a charm. Gives a lot of storage space with great flexibility.,

This is a great addition to my expanding smart home. The speaker sounds great and alexa is very responsive.,
"I bought this card to replace a lost 16 gig in my phone, (HTC G2). Seems to be working perfectly, so I will recommend to all. WAIT!!! read on...I had this card in my phone for a little over a month when it messed up. The phone stop recognizing the card, tried it in the computer and it was not recognized either. I contacted San-disk and they did send me out a replacement but I lost the few pictures I had on the original card. I could have sent the card to San-disk's data recovery people and they would have charged me $275.00 if they were able to recover the data and nothing if they couldn't. A bit to rich for me so I passed and unfortunately lost the photos.",
"Purchased 2 of these for my Samsung Galaxy S4 (AT&T). The cards work without any issue; storing games, movies and music on them. I would recommend to anyone and would most definitely purchase these again without hesitation. As always, a big thanks to Amazon for 2 day shipping!",
"Like all SanDisk products I have purchases in the past, this little card works just fine in my phone and I have not had any issues at all.",
I reformatted it in Disk Utility on my Mac so that is FAT32. And it works very well in my device (Nokia N900).,
does very good..... holds a lot of songs......,
Works well - no problems.  This is a very good price for a name brand SD card.  I will buy again,
"I use this on my 32 GB Microsoft Surface RT and it does the job as advertised, so 5 stars.I have used it to extend the storage capacity on the tablet to 64GB for storing documents, pictures etc. There are many articles on the internet that show you how to do that.",
Fast. Sleek. Small. Not really much to say about a microSDHC... Most of you buying this knows what they do.,

well what can you say for the card it has plenty of memory and cam wouldn't work with out it so it's a must have Thanks,
"Great product, great speed, no hassle, plug and play. Up to now sandisk products have always been reliable for me hope this keeps up to it's brand.",
"works good on my phone, now I can listen to music for hours and hours.  now all I need to do is remember to bring my charger to work.",
"I noticed a long time ago that even when not really running at very fast speeds (and I'm mostly talking about reading as mostly it was playing music and video files) this card seems to get fairly warm.  After a while -- pretty much just outside the point at which I could RMA it -- it started randomly disconnecting.  At first I thought it was my phone though I had no clue why it would ever do such a thing, so I wouldn't have sent it in at that point anyway.  It always seemed to be fine when I plugged it into my computer.  Over time it got worse and worse and I would have to remove and put it back in quite a few times to get it to finally work.  Eventually it started doing this on the computer too and that's when I realized something was fishy.  I switched to another card in my phone and the problems went away.  On the other hand, this one stopped working completely a bit later even in the computer.Maybe I just got a bad one, but right now I'd rather get a different one instead if I were to buy a new one.",
"Works as expected.  I suspect this is why so many people trust SanDisk.  I hope they stick with maintaining the integrity their products have earned.  I often pay a little more from SanDisk but I have never been disappointed with their products as I have others like ADATA.  In fairness to ADATA, who failed to make good on any of the several defective products I purchased from them, I have never had to test SanDisk's warranty as I've never had a failure.  Perhaps their product support is just as bad as ADATA's but I've never had the opportunity to test it!",
This product is the only one I had bought like this that has worked will recommend to all family and friends,
"I bought 64GB version of the card to use with GoPro Hero 3 black edition.  It didn't work out.  The card worked OK if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates.  E.g. worked fine in 720p with protune on, or 1080p with protune off.  However, in 1080p with protune on (bitrate is just shy of 6 MB/s in this mode -- much higher then with protune turned off) it was nothing but trouble.  Camera would sometime work, and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason.  I first suspected camera, but testing with different SD cards, it ended up being SanDisk's card that was at fault.  My spare card, an old and cheap 16GB PNY (also class 10), worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings.Once it was obvious it was problem with the card, I found people on GoPro's forums that had trouble with this specific card as well (well, you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself, right?).  Anyhow, I did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1GB of zeros from /dev/zero (where else would you find that many zeros ;-) onto a file on the card.  The result was that on average, SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB/s.  Just barely above the bar for class 10 card.  However, that was average over 1GB.  During the write test, the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops.  Drops were as low as 7MB/s.  Uh.  I thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB/s?  For comparison, my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along at constant 13 MB/s under the same test.  No spikes and no drops in speed.The card will probably work fine in most devices, as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer.  But if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates, and your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card, you may run into trouble.  Be wary of using it in Hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p with protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064G with adapter, and SDSDQUA-064G without adapter.  This conflicts with product description on Amazon.  While this is likely just Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing), it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers from testing the card.  The test is extremely simple.  Write out 1GB of zeros onto the card using standard Unix dd command to read 128KB blocks of zeroes from special device /dev/zero and write it onto the card.  128KB * 8192 = 1GB.  dd displays transfer stats once it finishes.  While dd was running, I run iostat in second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as a measure of current speed.  This was done on the Mac.  dd command line can be used as-is to repeat test on Linux system, however iostat command is different on Linux and would need to be modified slightly.  I choose 128KB block size, as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow.  Using different block sizes, results are comparable.$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 101.578307 secs (10570582 bytes/sec)So, 10 MB/s and all is good? Right? Wrong! iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this:$ iostat -d -w 1 disk2disk2KB/t tps MB/s123.11 76 9.12116.61 185 21.04122.94 49 5.88128.00 41 5.12128.00 89 11.11128.00 134 16.73128.00 69 8.61128.00 61 7.62128.00 99 12.36[ ... and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]IMO, the last column should never dip under 10MB/s for card labeled class-10.For comparison, same test run against Samsung Pro 64GB micro-SD card:$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 52.869111 secs (20309436 bytes/sec)$ iostat -d -w 1 disk2disk2KB/t tps MB/s125.30 138 16.86117.73 157 18.03123.04 150 18.00128.00 159 19.86128.00 156 19.47126.45 160 19.73128.00 150 18.72128.00 154 19.22128.00 153 19.11[ ... and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]So, Samsung is on average 2x faster, but more importantly it's speed is much more constant.  And critically important, it never dips under 10MB/s.",
I love the fact that it has the kids free time thus limiting what your child can read. Plus the parental controls the you can set time limits. It gives a parent full control over what and for how long a child can read.,
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
Fantastic product as it is described. I purchased 2 of them. Delivery was fast. I will definitely buy it again and recommend this product to anyone.,
"So I bought another sandisk product, and guess what? It works. Great job guys. And not too pricey either. Can't wait for the 128GB version...",
This chip seems to be thinner and lighter than the rest of my mini SD cards. Came with an adaptor card so it can be read by using a regular sized SD card slot. Or you can just read it while it is in the device.,
I put this in my tablet to store pictures and video. It does alot better than the class 4 I was using. Becuse I already had it in my junk drawer.,
The stock memory card that came with my Motorola Defy-XT was only 4 GB and I wanted to up the memory. This works quite well and was a good buy for the class 10 card.,
"As a quick note, unless they're on sale, it's best to avoid buying these in big box stores because they almost always seem to be overpriced. I purchased three of these for family members for their Samsung S4 phones and they're all very happy and pleased with them.",
"What can you say about a chip? It works, it's fast and has been trouble free. A great product at a great price.",
I purchased the Amazon Tap when it was on sale for around $80. The sound is amazing (unlike my Amazon Echo it has stereo speakers!) and the battery life is great! It has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so you can stream from the internet or from your mobile device. Highly recommended!,
"I initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing: the paperwhite is great, but if you have spending money, go for the voyage.Fortunately, I had friends who owned each, so I ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis: both models now have 300 ppi, so the 80 dollar jump turns out pricey the voyage's page press isn't always sensitive, and if you are fine with a specific setting, you don't need auto light adjustment).It's been a week and I am loving my paperwhite, no regrets! The touch screen is receptive and easy to use, and I keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day. (In any case, it's not hard to change the setting either, as you'll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day, not every now and then while reading).Also glad that I went for the international shipping option with Amazon. Extra expense, but delivery was on time, with tracking, and I didnt need to worry about customs, which I may have if I used a third party shipping service.",
"This SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 micro SD card can storage an enormous among of data. And with the class 10 reliability and speed, it's a great buy.",
"this did not last very long. Would not work in any of my mobile devices. I tried it in 4 different ones and the only place it now works is in my desktop in the adapter sleeve. Not much use there, since i already have 2 TB",
"Wasn't sure how this would work with my rural DSL but it is WONDERFUL. I haven't had any problems with it at all. It is easy to use and the voice command works just as they said it would. So very, very glad I bought it. Loads of stuff to watch. I have been able to catch up with some series I have missed, especially the BBC ones that I dearly love. I recommend it to anyone who likes variety in what they can watch. Along with my Amazon Prime most everything is FREE..that is an added bonus. Try it, you'll like it.",
"Yup, this is the chip you need if you never want to worry about running out. I use it with my GoPro Hero 3+ Black Edition on 1080 sw  and it goes for hours, longer than 2 or 3 batteries.",
"Overall for an Alexa product it does the same thing as all the other ones. This one is specifically portable and only needs to be put on the base for charging. The one main issue is that it is not voice activated (meaning it does not listen to you unless you press any of the buttons on top or the mic button in front. By having this feature, I could see it causing excess battery usage. Needs to be able to apps better.",
Works great in my compatible device BUT if you think you can reformat to FAT32 and us in an older device only designed for 32GB you will likely experience excess battery drain even if you think it is working fine to start with.,
I brought this for my 5 year old GranAngel she loves it the size is just right! The child proof case is ideal for her.,
This product is perfect for what I needed it for. Providing a ton of memory in my Samsung Note 10.1 in a small package.,
"Unlike the larger version, this does not need to be plugged in..making it portable....although you have to press the button for every request..it's great to take with you where ever you go..fully rechargable",
"This review is for the second generation Kindle Paperwhite. Like all kindle e-readers before it, this is a great product. However, I am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year's model. For this review, I focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new Paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year's model. Also, I found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising, so I will try to clear them up.HARDWAREDesign - The Kindle white has a nice look and shape. It fits well and is easy to hold in one hand. It's fairly light, so it doesn't tire the hands too much. I can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands. Its design is very similar to the previous Paperwhite - almost identical. The height and width are the same, the buttons are in the same location, and although this version is slightly lighter, it is not noticeable.Display - Although not a huge improvement from last year's model, the display is one of the best features of the Paperwhite. Like most e-readers, the Paperwhite uses digital ink technology. This model employs a more advanced version. In addition, the lighting has been upgraded, so among other things, it is more evenly lit. Together, they make for incredible viewing. In my opinion, it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. I really enjoy reading on it, text look very sharp and crisp, with little to no eye strain.Processor - The Paperwhite has an upgraded processor, which means smoother page turns and navigation. I am able to open books, flip pages, and navigate menus fairly quickly. There is barely any lag as I flip through many pages at a time. Also, the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all.Read more",
"So far my experience with all SanDisk memory products has been nothing but excellent. They work in all products I've tried them in and are reliable. I have two of the 32GB cards, one is used in Samsung Galaxy S and the other in Sony Nex-5 camera.",
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
Love it ... need to get some smart appliances! I also got the Echo dot - wish I got these items sooner,

"Having a tablet or a phone is inevitable in our life and there is nothing we can do about it. And I know, there are toddlers over there who can read a book in a cart while grocery shopping or just curiously looking around. But that's not our case. Our daughter is three years old, and she's a very nice girl, but she hates grocery shopping, she gets bored very easily and the only thing that helps, are her favorite cartoons.Earlier we gave her my or my husband's phone, but it's so easy for a toddler to drop things down, so we made a decision to buy her a tablet. The price was a trigger for us to buy Fire HD Kids Edition.We did not have the previous edition, but as far as I know, the only difference between them are that the 7th gen Fire 7 has a dual-band WiFi antenna and a slightly newer GPU.At first, we considered buying a 50 Fire 7 (regular one), but there are so many benefits in the kid's edition, that it's definitely worth to pay an extra 50 for it. And those benefits, that were important for us, are: - Kid-Proof Case. That's a must have! I chose the pink one for my daughter and she seems to like it. - 2-year worry-free guarantee. - One year of FreeTime Unlimited. She will love all the apps and game that are free. - I can choose what content my daughter will watch.The battery life is great, my daughter is still too little to watch cartoons for more than an hour a day, so it should work on a single charge for a week, or so.The display quality is just ok, I expected it to be at least better than the previous version (my nephew has it), but it's just the same.During the first day it has been dropped, and thrown, and kicked and it survived.Read more",
"I think this is probably a fine product, but it wasn't compatible with my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. Formatted as exFAT (as it came from the factory), didn't work at all, but that's a known problem with the GS3. But even after reformatting to FAT32, the card caused my phone to reboot multiple times.",
I have always been pleased with the SanDisk products and this one is no exception. It works as advertised. I would purchase it again.,
I love it so far it works as it should the price was good and I am very pleased in fact I bought a 64 gb as well for my phone I bought the 32 gb for my wife,
Moved my music library for phone/car use.Easy to set up and reliable.The drivers didn't like my older laptop so I had to work around it - any teen can tell you how to do so with only a slight roll of the eyes.,
"This works great and is just what I needed for my phone to hold my 30GB (and growing) music collection. Now I don't have to connect to the web to get my music, woohoo! It was an awesome price too. Took a little long to get here, but it Finally did. I admit I chose free ship, but ten days is still a quite a bit for this tiny thing.",
"This review is to try to offset some of Roku employees that are on here trying to knock this device.The first thing you notice after plugging everything in, is a 3-5 minute demo that you can unfortunately not bypass, even if you know your way around these types of devices. You will only see it once, and then you're good to go. The device is small and beautiful. The remote is better than any other device, including Roku 3, and my WD TV Live.First the PROs:- It's the fastest media streamer, by far. That's not only a good thing if you own one, but it will force Roku and other companies to stop skimping on the hardware, and firmware updating.- The menu is intuitive and easy to maneuver. You can't move things around yet, but I'm sure they will eventually let you customize your own page. As of now, the apps (which would be at the top, if I could change it) are at the bottom. Apps are larger and higher resolution than the Roku.- The voice button is amazing. For a first attempt, they almost got it right. I understand this is a proprietary device, so they will always want you to use Amazon instant video for your viewing. But this option should search for all of your linked accounts, including Hulu, Netflix, etc. I'm not sure that they will ever fix this, because they will lose money and viewers. Even so, it's still a PRO, because it does work well.- Streaming quality - WOW Everything I've tried buffers so quickly, that it's almost already at 1080p when it starts playing. With my Roku, Netflix looks great, but it takes 5-10 seconds to get there. I currently have 100Mbps of internet, so I'm not sure what everyone else goes through, but I can tell you this streams better than Roku. Period.- Overheating and reboots - My Roku 3 cannot handle more than a couple of hours of viewing before it decides that was too many rows of stairs. It gets exhausted, and it has to reset itself. This device is more powerful, and after using it all day today, I can say my Roku 3 will be immediately up for sale, once they add the Time Warner Cable and HBOgo apps.-- PLEX -- Okay, I always blamed my Plex for the long delays on my Roku. With my internet speeds, I could never understand why it was always loading at 1080p settings, regardless of the bitrate. Anyway, I was wrong. It's the device. Not only does the Fire TV have a much better PLEX app (which is beautiful, btw), but everything streams at maximum quality within seconds. No re-loading (buffering) during movie playback. And the movies are in a much nicer grid layout, so I don't have to sift through one row to get to a movie selection.Now the CONS:- Obviously it's still missing some apps. You are crazy if you think HBOgo will go much longer without being added. The same for other apps. They built it, so they WILL come.- Interface - it is nice, but as I stated in the PROs, you can't make changes to it, hopefully just for now. If it stays this way, it will be a little annoying to have to scroll down all the way just to get to my apps.- One major issue that is very upsetting to me, is the fact that they couldn't add two very important things - USB 3.0, and 802.11ac. If Amazon claims they were listening, they would also know that these two things would dramatically improve the user experience. I haven't plugged my WD 4TB hard to it yet, but it is a 3.0 hard drive. Now it will unfortunately revert to 2.0 speeds. Don't build a supposedly forward-thinking device with two things that are now considered dated. I have a feeling this was done to make money off the Fire TV 2. Thanks for that.Overall, it is the best device currently available, and they really made the experience fun. It does make you want to call your cable company and cancel service. Buy it...you will not regret it.",
Changes the whole look of the Echo ... after i purchased i think i should have gone with the tan leather. But blue is my favorite color and it adds a bit of a pop to a mundane looking black disk! The texture is also really nice feel and look to it!,
"The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more",
"What can I say about a memory card?  I purchased it to increase the memory in my phone, it fits as it should, and works as it should.",
"I got my Kindle a few years ago and barely used it. Recently I discovered it again and have been using it daily, always in a hard protective case as it has been from day 1. Yesterday I opened the cover ready to read and discovered the screen had apparently cracked, seemingly for no apparent reason (no extreme temperatures, dropping, pressure, etc.). A quick Google search revealed this is a common problem, especially for my model, which made me think Amazon would replace the device for me due to the obvious design flaw. Not a chance though. Despite endless reports of this problem popping up through simple internet searches the representative I spoke to denied this was a common problem and was only able to offer me a very slight discount on a new product. Not sure it is worth the investment again - thinking it is better to stick to reading on my iPad, which is equipped with indestructible Gorilla Glass. Bottom line: do not buy a Kindle if you want a lasting product",
The SanDisk Ultra 16GB memory card has shown no sign of not being exactly what I needed.  A good deal.,
I first boughy alezxa from amazon and found the voice recognition and search algorithms lacking,
"An excellent microSD card from SanDisk.  I purchased this to format FAT32 for use with mySamsung Galaxy Tab 3 (7-Inch, White)and, once so formatted, works flawlessly.  It never has ""unmounted"" on its own, it's lightning fast, it's reliable and offers plenty of storage.  Reasonably priced as well.  In fact, I purchased this on sale at my local big-box ""blue"" retailer with the yellow price tag for a logo for $27.99.",
"I bought this to use with my GoPro Hero3 Black, and it works great! No problems at all. For the price, it's hard to beat.",
"It's a SanDisk, so what more is there to say? The quality is fantastic and it helps you transfer files if you are wary of the cloud.",
"Puchased this card right after I received my Samsung Galaxy S III. Truly found this to be quicker than any other class 10 card I've owned. The cost on Amazon was far less than I've seen anywhere else. If ""you're"" looking for this type of product, then this is the one for you...IMHO of course.",
"Maybe I got a defective card but this one felt a bit &#34;thinner&#34; and &#34;flimsier&#34; than other micro-SD cards I've had.The real problem was after a week of use as expanded storage in a tablet, I started having trouble with certain programs installed on the card, then finally the tablet gave me a message that the card was corrupt, and while a PC would recognize it, eery time I tried to format the card, there would be an error.",
"It works, but file writes are a bit slower than expected on a USB3 reader.Also, both reads and writes are FASTER with the card inside the standard-size SD adapter (15 MB/s vs 10 write; 45 MB/s vs 22 MB/s read) on the same card reader.  Can't figure why...",
"I bought this for my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, for some reason I couldnt get it to work in it.  So I put it in my Galaxy Note 2 phone and it works great.  I have 7 movies and other assorted crap on it and it still has plenty of room.",
"This is the best accessory that you can buy for your smartphone! Simple explanation:1) I loaded all my HD movies onto this micro SD card, inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3, and it plays them superbly without ANY delays, as it it up to 30mb/s read speed!2) The most important reason for this being the best accessory for your phone is to think about this: The premium you pay for an iPhone 64GB is $200. The price you pay for this 64GB micro SD card is $50 (depends on Amazon's pricing at the time). That means you get the same thing for $150 less, AND you can interchange your SD card between devices (if you buy a new tablet for example).No brainer.Note that it reads only at 10mb/s, so a 7GB HD movie will take about 10 - 15 minutes to load up.",
"With a USB 3.0 card reader, CrystalDiskMark shows blazing fast 47MB/s read but disappointingly slow 13MB/s write speed. So you can pretty much forget about reliable 1080P video recording.Update: It is correct that write speed great than 10MB/s is enough for 1080P recording. I need to clarify that the card is very slow when UHS-1 is not enabled. The read/write speeds drop to 13.3/7.9 MB/s. For devices that are a few years old such as Canon T2i which does not support UHS, 1080P recording may not be reliable. This card is classified as ""class 10,"" it should support sustained write speed of at least 10MB/s without UHS. It fails my test, as observed by other reviewers as well.",
"It's a little more than SanDisk's slow 16GB microSDHC, but cheaper than some other brands, and it works.Writes are a bit slow when the card fills up, but that's endemic to all SD cards, and it's not as bad as some other cards.",
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music!

So happy with this purchase!",
"Fast access time AMAZING amount of storage in such a small size.And the price was impressive,could not beat it!Thanks Amazon!",
Excellent cards. I have this one in my ASUS Transformer  and a 16 GB one in my camera. Both work flaulessly.,
"*Edit 12/23/15*It appears that the linked SD card below and the one made for Fire tablets are the same price now, although the Fire one still does not come with an adapter. Should have been that way from day one.*end editLet's get the cost/benefit of buying this versus the 50 model out of the way. For 100, you get:7 Kindle Fire without sponsored lockscreens 65Kid-proof case 202-year accident protection 161-year of Free Time Unlimited 36 minimumThat's a nice value! I've seen a few reviews where people are upset that it doesn't work without Wi-Fi, but I'm not sure what their expectations are. If you have previously download an app/game/video and it doesn't require internet access (some do, some don't), it works fine. As for performance, it's OK. Not great. It freezes every now and then and needs to be rebooted more often than I'd like to get it working again. This is frustrating to a 3-year-old, as you can imagine. Hard to complain too much given the price, but I was expecting it to be more stable.You will want to buy a micro SD card because the Fire OS takes up 5 of the 8 GB of on-board storage. This is where Amazon is doing something that is, shall we say, a little sketchy. When you customize your purchase, it allows you to select the SanDisk 32 GB SD Memory Card for All-New Fire Tablets for 19.99 (or more or less depending on the storage size), but gives you no other options. This SD card is by the looks of it the exact same as this one ...Read more",
AS ADVERTISED. 64GB HIGH TRANSFER SPEEDS AND oh yeah ANDROID FTW 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1,
I use it to extend Nook's memory. Not much to say. It works well enough so I can forget it exists.,
"I have the Amazon Tap (which I purchased at Best Buy about a month ago) and love it so much I bought one for my son and his family. They love it, too!",
This doesn't work on the galaxy note 10.1. It is getting detected however it is not being utilized by the note 10.1.,
"this card would not show 64 GB until i spent $60 on a card reader that supports sdxc, and after doing that, it is transferring at class 1 speed. i managed to get it formatted in FAT32 with 59 GB free for my Cowon J3, but it's taking 10 hours to transfer 30 GB to it. i got a refund because this is not the service and quality i paid for. i just hope the music lists on my PMP when i turn it on tomorrow. i have it in the microSDXC slot of the AFT PRO-57U, which is connected to a Syba VIA VL800 USB 3.0 card. feel free to tell me i am doing it wrong and how to get class 10 speed.UPDATE: the transfer finished, but the data does not show in my Cowon J3, so the early versions that worked are gone. do not buy these for a device that is not SDXC specific because they have changed something in them.",
"This has got to be by far the BEST microSD card on the market. It is very fast, was easy to set it up. I am using it in a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works flawlessly. Well worth the money.",
"While I prefer the Pro SanDisk for my cameras, this has worked well in a smaller point-and-shoot camera, and now in my Galaxy SIII.  Plenty of room on it.  Ultra is not as fast as Pro, but plenty fast enough for my phone, including the few photos I take.  About 1 to 1.5 seconds to write to it.  Now getting 64 Gb units, and looking at a 128 Gb (expensive).",
"storage size, fast read/write speed, great price (almost half that of a certain popular brick & mortar store).  I use this in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 and I'm glad I chose it.  I would def recommend it to anyone looking for microSD storage.",
It arrived in a timely manner and does what it is supposed to do. It's not pretty and cute but it serves its purpose.,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"Fast transfers.  I was hesitant to buy a larger micro storage, thinking that it would be easy to damage.  This storage fits the phone perfect, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.",
Bought for use with my GroPro and this card allows my to video for as long as my batteries will allow.  Must have for a GoPro user!,

"This is the SD card you need for your smart phone. I bought this for my S3 and been using it for over a year and it works perfect. I don't think ill ever have to worry about running out of space. Plus the price on Amazon, you cant beat it.",
Bought this for extended memory in a Galaxy S III.  Great price. Easy to install and the phone recognized it instantly. Does what its supposed to do.,
I bought this chip to be used to increase the use of my smart phone and it has increased the memory.  At least for now.,
"I have purchased two of these 64gb sd cards and used them in an Android phone, and in a video recorder.After about 3 months usage in my phone, the card would randomly unmount and it took many remounts or reboots to get the card to work again.  Eventually, it stopped accepting writes at all, and couldn't even be formatted... although I could see what was on there.I repurchased the card, and after a couple months, the same thing happened again: random unmounts.  I moved the card to a video recorder, where it worked for a while... but even with a different usage pattern, it died again.I have had no problems with 32GB cards so far.  I'm staying away from this generation of 64GB cards.----EDIT----Getting these cards RMA'd was quick and easy.  I had a Lexar 128GB SD card die too, and I sent the cards in all at the same time.  I haven't gotten an update from Lexar, but I got updates AND my replacement from SanDisk.  Supposedly there was something fixed in this new card revision.  I hope so.",

"This memory card works great with my new GoPro Hero 3 Black. The footage looks incredible, and the filming time allows me to get a solid 45 minutes of action in.",
Works great in my Motorola Atrix 4G.  Consistently reliable - never any problems.  Will definitely purchase SanDisk again in the future.  Keep up the great work!,
"Runs all the features of GoPro black edition seamlessly!  Very cool, great speed, good look, would buy again!  Need a memory card buy this",
"I bought this and after a month of use on my Samsung Galaxy s2 it failed and could no longer be seen, and when i contacted support they said that i had to send it to them to get replaced which is more expensive than buying a new one",
"I bought this after I found out that you can add a memory card to the Samsung galaxy s4! I never even knew that you could, and so once I found out I bought this and installed it. It's worked perfectly since and holds all of my songs and videos.  Great buy!",
Not much to say other than they are made with Excellent quality. Price is fine for the qualityYes I would recommend to a friend.,
"This SD works as its supposed, I have it in my phone right now and have had it for months. No issues!",
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
I bought this card so I could have some storage that was quick.  This card delivered.  That's about all there is to say.,
"Works great. Got it quickly, it was well packed, plugged it in an it's been working fine since. Only been a month so can speak to long term reliability. Will buy another one soon.",
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music!

"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
"Use these in my GoPro and T2i Canon Camera (with adapter). They are great cards and having multiple (because of the price) means that if one were to get damaged on a trip, I'm not down and out.",
"This MicroSD serves the purpose in every way. If I need another, I will certainly buy another one of these.",
Excellent price for the amount of storage and speed. I just washed this in the washing machine and was preparing to buy another. After checking it for errors it came up with none. Needless to say I don't have to buy another but did feel compelled to write a review. Cheers!,
I worked on one of the first Drum Drives. THis is still pretty darn amazing. I think if they go smaller we will lose them. grat item. good access speeds,
I've been using this card on my Venue Pro 8 without any issues.  I used primarily to store photos and videos. The card is reliable but not fast.  Data transfers on Windows range from 15 to 20MB/s.  That speed is sufficient for most purposes.  I got my card at $32 which is s good deal.  A faster card can easily double this price.,
This is perfect. A lot of people were commenting that the case falls off and it's not portable. That's not the intended use of the case. It is strictly for decorative use. It look great and comes in several color options. Would definitely purchase again.,
Works great to control Alexa when she understands you and has good battery life but sound lacks bass except at low volumes. gets very loud at least. Easily connects to Bluetooth.,
"Review for: SanDisk Ultra 64 GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-A),This product arrived via USPS, its not in any individual packing from the manufacturer, it was placed in an SD case together with the adapter.  So, I am unable to verify warranties or authenticity. The Samsung S3 recognized and formatted this with no problem.  It sees it as an external memory with 59GB.  The Six GB is probably allocated for FAT/File allocation table.  Will order again from this seller!",

"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more",
Great speaker sound and ease of setup. Works great with Amazon music option.,
The first unit I received had the dreaded defect where it would disconnect then reconnect which was super annoying. SanDisk has a very nice online warranty software in place and since it was a known issue they were speedy with a replacement. The new unit works perfectly and provides plenty of space. As a manufacture it was nice to be treated as I treat my customers from such a larger company.,
Thank You. Great Product for all ages. Thank You!!,
this microsdhc card fit perfect in my grandsons tablet. its great to be able to download extra music and games for him.,

"Let me guess: you love books, but you're not sure you want to get a kindle because you love the feel of books, rightI'm here to tell you that the kindle is the perfect balance of book and digital format.SHORT REVIEWYes, you should buy a kindle. Get the paperwhite with no ads. You're welcome.LONG REVIEWI love physical books too, I'm with you. But I know myself, and I know that once I forget to take the book I'm reading with me, that's it. I'll start another book and rarely finish the first. I also know if I try and read on my phone or iPad that I'll get distracted and start wondering about what's happening on the internet (Instagram's not gonna scroll ITSELF). Either way I'm not finishing the book.WHY KINDLEThe kindle takes the best of both worlds and mashes them together. The e ink display is honestly incredible. I wish iPhones had an e ink display. It really looks just like a printed page. So you get the experience of reading a physical paper book, but with the perks of being digital.Namely:- Share what book you're reading to Goodreads, Facebook, or twitter (so you can look SMORT)- Built in dictionary (so you can learn the proper spelling of the word SMORT)- Export your highlights as a PDFPlus, it'll also sync with the kindle app on your phone so you can squeeze in the final few pages of the chapter while you're in the bathroom (don't pretend you don't do that. You're either on your phone or you're reading the febreeze ingredients)READING IN BEDThe backlight looks great. It's a perfect size.Read more",

I got this SD card for my android tablet. My only complaint is after the tablet installed its file system my computers would no longer recognize the SD card. Still love it.,
"This card is fast, works really well with my S3 and prepare to last. The app is good not the best but it gives you the option to back up your phone",
Buyer beware card unreadable from the get go. Luck for me amazon helped me out. There are many others on here that know how to format to Fat32 threw Window 7 and have had same issues.,
I have had it for six months or so now and have had no problems with it. It's awesome. Thanks!,
Its fast. I use it every day in my Samsung Epic Touch 4G. I will never need to worry about needing extra space.,
"This card did an AMAZING job with holding my music on my phone. Videos played with ease and everything! Highly recommend this card to anyone. The SD card adapter also worked perfectly for me.I use this card on a Samsung Galaxy S2 (Epic 4G Touch, Sprint version). It works just fine on that phone even though the phone specs say it only holds up to 32gb. Just put the card in, go to your settings, fine SD and storage, and then scroll to this card and format the card. Once formatted, it'll work just as any other SD card.",
"I didn't want something that was always monitoring room conversations. This appears to only listen when I tap it, and that is much more acceptable to me. Works great. :-)",
Works as expected.  High transfer speed.  Nice to have extra microSD adapters lying around since I always seem to misplace them.  Mainly bought it to use in my Nikon DSLR since I can put the card directly into my (CM modded) Nook HD+ tablet in the field and view my images on a larger screen.,
This is a wonderful product.  I have over 100 movies on my phone not including audio.  And I still have 30gb left.  This is absolutely wonderful.,
"I bought this to expand the capacity of my Galaxy S5 for music, pictures, and video. I plugged the card into the phone...and I have about 60GB more space. I don't notice any lag from the phone accessing files from this card as opposed to internal memory. It seems just as fast.",
I love this micro sd card. Awesome amount of space and just plain ole reliable. You dont find to many products like that nowadays.,
It says on the Acer that the max is 32GB but I popped this puppy in and it read the 64 gigs just fine.  I have my MP3s and some photos on here so I do not clog up the HD for my tablet.,
And does it fast. Been installed in my Acer Iconia Tab for months and has endured file transfer after file transfer with not a single glitch.,
No problems so far! Not much to say really. I got it for my Canon Power Shot and it works as it should. Came perfectly packaged and was easy to use.,
"Great memory card, I love the fact that this came in frustration free packaging. And even better, it also came with an SD adapter for free! Thanks a bunch amazon and SanDisk.",
I was having problems on my gopro videos being choppy and cutting out. this card fixed it all its fast enough and does the trick,
Bought this micro sd card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and it works flawlessly. Lots of space and fast!,
I use SDHC in my many cameras. They work well.,
"Currently using this in a Samsung galaxy S4,with zero issues just put it in your phone and you are good to go.  Apps also seem to run faster off this card than internal memory.  Taking photos/videos at full hd definitely goes quicker than my old 32gb SanDisk card.  Definitely recommend this product.",

"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more",

"i needed a class 10 micro SD card, and this small size, large memory. works just fine.  The price was very good as well",
It got it because my sandisk 32gb was getting full and had about 2-3gb free. I have no almost filled this one up in a few months and have about 17gb free now. I am starting to need the new sandisk 128gb. I need money and storage. I have been using it without any problems coming up. My s4 treats it nice and I can get decent speeds of about 10-15mb/s transfer but I do hate waiting for a gb of 1080p footage to transfer but I guess I would rather have storage over speed.

As advertised. Good write and read speeds and works well with new Microsoft surface. Only complaint is there was a significant price drop after I purchased this card. But that's not amazons fault nor the product.,

No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded. I've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that I'd expect any besides possible fading).",
"I like the box but I'm on a wired network and overnight it looses the connection so the next day I have to unplug the Fire TV box and let it reboot to find the network again. I called customer service and they said they would look into it and get back - well, they never got back to me and it has been over two weeks. I like it when it works but I hate having to reboot the thing every time I want to watch it.",
"The San Disk Ultra 64 GB Micro memory card works really well. The card is tiny, but the card comes with an adapter. I use it for the GoPro.",
Best kindle so far.,
"I received the memory card in great condition and packing,.  I am very pleased with it.  I put it in an outdoor camera to video comings and goings of wild life.  Works great",
"Good hardware, but limited apps on amazon ecosystem.Most apps that I already purchased with google play store won't work on Kindle Fire.Second I don't want to pay for same apps on another ecosystem (one for apple, one for google already ...)At least amazon allows to return the product without hassle ...",
"this card is great and at 20 bucks its a steal. The card handles high transfer speeds which is good for music, pictures and videos. Do not get any lag or have to wait for card to load up.",
"When purchasing a memory expansion for my electronic devices I typically purchase from SanDisk.  It is a trusted name and does what I need when I need to do it, like feeding the chickens or mowing the lawn, Sony and Ultra can't do that....",
Most speaker like this will be over USD150.00 but this one is less than that price with a great sound quality,
"This is my second Kindle, I also have a 3G Kindle touch, and of the two, I prefer the touch overall.Features I like about the Fire: I love and hate the carousel all at the same time. I love how easy it is to scan through the books that I have on my Kindle and seeing the pictures of the covers (because sometimes I like to pick my books based solely on the cover). I don't like how every book I purchase shows up on the carousel whether I've sent it to the Fire or not (there may be a way to stop that from happening, but I haven't figured it out yet if there is.)I really like having my Fire connected to my Goodreads account so that when I finish reading a book on the Fire and write a review for Amazon, it also posts to Goodreads for me without any extra work on my part.I also like being able to read on my Fire without an additional light source.I do not like the glare on the screen while trying to read in sunlight. For me, the Fire has been basically useless anywhere that sunlight is involved, which includes car rides on sunny days as the sun shining through the car windows creates too much glare to read. I've seen some people mention a way to sort of solve that problem, but I have yet to figure out how to do it, and instead just take my Touch with me if I'm going to possibly anywhere near sunlight.",
Good price works great would buy again good value for the price,
"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more",
"I bought this because I needed more storage for Asus TF700T tablet and this was the largest capacity microSD card I could find. Card came preformated with the exFAT file system which is recognized by the Asus TF700T tablet and many other Android devices. The only reason I take a star off is because I can't attain transfer speeds anywhere near the 30 MB/s that SanDisk claims (I averaged around 8 MB/s which is fine for utilizing media on the tablet, but made the initial transfer of 30GB of files onto the card a slow process).",
"I will probably never take it out of my tablet, because it is so hard to get a hold of, but it installed and is working fast.  I did not use the adapter, good to have in case I need it.",
"as described. took 3 weeks to arrive from china but its the real thing, same as picture. Speeds are good, 30mb/s read, 10mb/s write.",
"I ordered this in anticipation of getting my new Galaxy S4. It arrived quickly (long before the phone was is my hands!) and was easy to install. After almost 2 months, I've had no problems at all so far. I store all my photos and music on it, and it's great not to have to worry about maxing out the phone's native memory.",
"it is good memory card, it is working fine until now. i am using it in my Galaxy S3 just for storing the pictures which i take, so i do not know if it will come up with issues later on",
"In real-life use--copying compressed files to and from the card--it clocks in at barely over half the advertised speeds: about 16MB/s read and about 7.5MB/s write, as averaged between testing on several SD slots (some USB-connected, some PCIe-connected) on several computers, plus a just-released smartphone. Very unimpressed by the &#34;up to&#34; marketing of SD card vendors and makers.The actual raw size is also about 59.5GB, which I find fascinating for a flash device, which is only ever manufactured with powers-of-two components. (1KB = 1,024B)",
Works great; should last a long time!,
I have a point and shoot camera.  This works well with it. Have no problems so far.  I think my camera is the speed limiting step rather than this card.,
"Best in it's class. Very happy with it, Amazon offered very good price, will recommend to everyone. So, far works with everything i used with.",
Needed for my cell phone - works perfectly.  SanDisk has never been a disappointment in the 30 plus years I've been in IT/computer work.,
When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't,
"Works as described, good packaging, fair price, and i have no issues with the product up to this point.  thanks.",
Upgraded from the 32GB and very satisfied. Works great with my phone and large library of music. Def would reccomend.,

It appears to be limited to Amazon content, at least for videos. I believe that they do include a third party service if you search for music.I am searching for House of Cards, Season 2, a Netflix original. I am a Netflix subscriber so I would expect the Netflix listing to be displayed but Fire TV only returns the show's Season 1 available for purchase at Amazon and does does not list Netflix at all. As a Netflix subscriber, I could watch both seasons 1 and 2 for free but, according to Fire TV's search, Season 2 doesn't exist and I'd have to pay 2.99 per episode if I wanted to watch Season 1.See how Roku's search (second half of video) correctly shows that Season 1 is available from Netflix, Amazon, MGo and Vudu and that I can gety get Season 2 from Netflix. It's also telling me (checkmarks) that I subscribe to 3 of the 4 services listed.It's up to everyone to weigh Amazon's faster and more convenient voice search feature that returns Amazon-only content vs. Roku's ability to find content across the channels/services it carries.REVIEW BEGINS HERE:As a current/former owner and user of streamers such as Roku 3, Roku Stick and Google's Chromecast and also streaming/gaming platforms such as PS3/PS4 and Xbox 360/One, I believe I can do a fair assessment on what Amazon's Fire streamer is about and how it compares with the alternatives. I rely on reviews to help me make informed and rational purchase decisions and, hopefully, my assessment of Amazon's Fire TV may help others decide whether this is what they need or want.BROAD ASSESSMENTThe Fire TV will have to find its place in a pretty crowded marketplace. From what I've experienced so far, due to its tight integration with the Fire HDX tablets and Amazon's own Instant Video service in search it should be a great pick for anyone who owns the Amazon tablet and already subscribes to Amazon's Prime. Its ability to play games and the ease of downloading them should also appeal to non-hard-core gamers. For everybody else, depending on one's specific needs and expectations, the Fire TV may or may not be the 'right' streamer to buy.As one who purchased Amazon's original Kindle Fire on day one and went through several generations of Amazon's Kindle reader I expect that Amazon's streamer will also evolve or grow overtime. Amazon will listen to 'us' and the next generation streamer will be a much more interesting, 'new and improved', more capable and better tuned to our needs and wants. Until then, I would say that the current Fire TV is a competent, Amazon-content-biased (through search) streamer with gaming capabilities, lacking some in content and showing some innovation on search (offset by its currently favoring Amazon's service) and the user interface in general. Parental controls and the games could make it a favorite streamer if young children are also watching. If all you want is streaming and don't care about casual gaming you may feel that you are paying for capabilities that you don't need.CONTENTThe Fire TV offers most but not all mainstream services and I suspect it covers what most of us will ever want to access and I am sure that more services will be added in time. However, at this time Amazon's selection pales when compared to Roku's 1000+ wildly diverse channels but the Rokus have been around for a while. All mainstream services now on Fire TV are also available on Roku, PS3/4, Xbox 360/One and many on Google's Chromecast.Fire TV attempts to be a little different when it comes to accessing content, allowing for voice search but results are currently returned mostly from Amazon's Instant Video. By comparison, Rokus offer text based cross-service search with results returned from most 'big' providers. Amazon's attempt to predict and preload what we are most likely to watch will have to be assessed over a longer period of time so, time will tell.The soon to be implemented parental controls should differentiate and distinguish Amazon's product from the competition once they are implemented.INNOVATIONAmazon's great innovative, revolutionary, disruptive device was the Kindle reader and the enhanced Kindle Paperwhite. I suspect that thousands of acres of trees are still known as 'forests' instead of 'recyclable material' these days because of the Kindle. Amazon's Fire tablets are nice but they are... tablets. The Fire TV streamer/gaming device falls probably under 'okay' or 'interesting' streamers and 'not too bad' gaming platforms.The quad-core CPU is also nice but, whether I'm streaming on a significantly more powerful PS4 or a tiny one-core CPU Chromecast, the video/audio quality seems to be comparable and practically indistinguishable. I assume that the reason for a more powerful CPU is the game-playing part.The lack of large permanent storage (HDD) implies that, as a gaming platform, the Fire TV will allow for mostly small to medium-size games with a lot of cloud interaction and storage. Again, a feature that may not be suitable for those whose ISPs charge by the Megabyte or impose a monthly download quota on their customers.Game playing on the Fire TV works but those used with big console's lag-free controllers that 'rumble', talk back and sense motion may not view the Fire TV as a serious gaming platform.I would say that Amazon's streamer is solidly in the mainstream as far as innovation. It's a quality product but not a revolutionary one and that's still Okay.VALUEThere's very little that Amazon's Fire TV does that other platforms don't do.- The PS3/4 and the Xbox 360/One are vastly superior gaming platforms and equally good streamers and multimedia machines. Only they are much larger physically and cost significantly more.- The Chromecast and the Rokus are a lot more innovative and allow for a lot more flexibility and integrate nicely with tablets and PCs and allow for streaming personal content without being limited to a specific brand or model of tablet. They are also somewhat more difficult to setup.- Small streamers such as the Roku Stick and the Chromecast are very portable as they fit into one's shirt pocket. Amazon's Fire TV could be carried around at least in theory but it's not as easy to move around.- Roku is still the leader of 'content' but Amazon's selection should cover what most of us want to watch most of the time.- The Fire TV costs a lot more than a Roku or a Chromecast but, even if a gaming controller is added, is still less than a PS3 or an Xbox 360- Voice search as implemented on Fire TV at the time I am writing this (restricted to Amazon and Vevo) is in effect hiding content from other services, potentially costing you money if one show is available to purchase or rent at Amazon but it may be also carried by another service you subscribe to as a 'free' stream.WHO NEEDS ITAnyone who already has one or more Roku, Chromecast or Xbox, Playstation in their homes probably don't need one at this time. Unless they are tightly integrated into Amazon's ecosystem or are cable cutters who wish some tighter controls over what their kids are watching.Those who are looking for their first streamer should consider- Fire TV's ease of use (beats the Chromecast but it's probably on par with Roku and the Xbox/Playstations)- Amazon's great user support- Roku's enormous channels selection- Playstation and Xbox being clearly superior gaming platforms (if you don't mind paying up to 60 for newly released games)- Amazon's attempt to keep their users confined to Amazon's own hardware platforms and content streams vs. Roku's and Chromecast relative openness- Fire TV's split gaming/streaming personality (Jack of 2 trades) vs. Roku's and Chromecast focus on streaming- Price, of courseIt's not an easy decision to make. I would be very happy with the Fire TV if it was the first streamer device in the house. With so many stream-capable and game-playing boxes/sticks already operating and doing well, I like Amazon's Fire TV for being a well designed, capable streamer with some nice extra capabilities but I also like and I've been using the Rokus for their huge number of channels and portability and great interface and the Chromecast for allowing me to easily send whatever is in my Chrome browser to the TV. I hope that Amazon's search will soon expand to cover non-Amazon services or it won't be a useful tool. I may not have the the Fire TV attached to the big TV in the living room but our daughter who happens to be a faithful Kindle and Amazon Prime user asked for it in her room.",
"I purchased this to go into an external wireless connect drive that is made by the same manufacturer. Other than having to format it differently than the default (a very simple process), I have not experienced any issues with it.",
Works great to protect the Kindle from drops.,
"Not that Amazon needs another 5 star review for this remote, but damn. This is a great remote. We don't have and never will have a game console in my house. My 4 year old and I have a blast playing Crossy Road and Shark Evolution on our big screen TV with this remote. Super great. Glad I bought it.",
"I bought this for my Note 3. I put some of my data on it, and when I go to access my data, my data is there. It feels faster than the Note 3's internal storage. Currently a very good piece of tech. I'll update this review if anything new develops.",
was using it for my tablet before i decided to switch to my phone.So far so good its really fast,
"It seems to work fine so far (2 Days with it). What I don't like is how Amazon has made it so thePrime content is mixed with the For Pay content, with no easy way to just see what is ONLY Prime content. This is obviously made to divert you into buying more non Prime content...Amazon, please give us a CLEAR way to view Prime Only if that's what we want. I know we can voice search for anything... and that's great, but sometimes we just want to Go Fishing and would like to fish in the Prime pond only. This is a pretty big deal when you compare this to competing (Think ROKU) products that let you do just that.Hard to believe your competition does a better job with presenting your own content than you do. Maybe an update in the near future will Fix this.",
I needed more memory because my phone kept telling me I was short on memory. This is more than enough memory and I have so many pictures on my phone now! This was a good buy!,
"I love this product , so nice to have for trips!!!",
"I love this card. It is fast...... and enough space to hold more than I will use. I can put movies on there with plenty of space for music, pictures, ect.",
"All I did was install this into a Galaxy Reader gizmo, and it worked perfectly with no fuss.  I returned a different kind (also SanDisk) that didn't work at all.  This is the one to get.",
"Decent transfer speeds out of phone..in phone sees around 10-12MB/s down to 5. This card is nothing to write home about however, as it only lasted me 7 months. Now it will not read in my phone or laptop or friend's phone. So now I lost all my files....I recommend you store your vital files in the phone.",
"This is a very good microSD memory, i use it in an Android 4.0 phone, it sees 29.71 GB of space. It was recognize immediately by the phone and it does not freeze when i'm playing a videogame (like Asphalt 7). The design is very cool too. I like its speed. I would recommend this memory to any smartphone user.",
I got this for my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone for additional storage.I originally had another card in it that was apparently not fast enough or something and gave me errors while shooting videoit would let me shoot video but not watch them backthis card fixed this problem,

Works great in my GoPro3 camera. No dropped frames so far.Arrived on time. Good price. Would recommend this item.,
"No problems here, works perfectly fine just as expected. Threw it into my Surface Pro to get a little more storage capabilities (for music, media, etc.). Had to format to use which I didn't realize at first, but that's my fault for being an idiot in the first place. No complaints, fine product, would recommend.",
"This worked right out of the box for my Samsung Galaxy S3. Fast speeds, class 10. Half the price as a comparable product at a Big Box store. I may buy a second one later.",
"I purchased new Samsung Galaxy S4 phones for my wife and me. We wanted to be able to take pictures and family event videos without constantly worrying about not having space on the phones. The cameras on the Galaxy S4 are wonderful, but that means bigger files too. These &#34;SanDisk Ultra 64 GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card&#34; are fast and we have not even begun to fill them up.",
As with most things SanDisk it functions well and so far no issues.  Comes with the adapter which is a big plus.,
This is a piece of crap. This is my 3rd card in 3 months. This is ridiculous.Do not buy this crap,
very affordable memory with a lot of storage this was an excellent purchase that was worth it thank every one,

"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
Had to give it 4 stars because when formatted it only provides 28GB.  Not as clean as I would have expected a SanDisk product to be.  Especially a Class 10 product.,
32 GB seems to be the right size memory card for my needs. The micro SD card fits several of my devices and downloads easily to the computer.,
This is one of the best. Bought it for my phone and works awesome. All the songs are now on this SD.,
I bought this card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.  It is exactly what I wanted and it works great.,
I've been a sandisk user for years and never developed a problem with a disk.  Amazing how much these little disk can hold!,

64 GB additional memory for a great low price.  SanDisk provides exceptional quality at an affordable price.  Easy to install.,
Just really thought it would have been more useful without having to have to make additional purchases for music I like.,
"Out of its storage and into my new phone.  Recognized, formatted and  and available in less than a minute.  Simple!",
We needed an option to increase the storage available in my wife's Nook Tablet and this serve the purpose perfectly. Just inserted it into the Micro SD slot and seconds later it was recognized.,
Great card. Now they need to make a more 128 gb cards so I can buy one of those without having to pay double. 200 bucks..?  No thanks.,
randomly died out of nowhere. i have the camera on for about 2 min and the card worked. turned the camera off and back on a few min later and the card no longer worked. I have no idea what happened but this seems to be a common problem with these cards.,
"I'm so disappointed in SanDisk. I bought this for my Galaxy S3 phone. Worked great for the first few months. Suddenly I noticed some pictures were missing. Then it kept giving me an error that the 'SD card has unexpectedly stopped working' then i tried popping out the card and popping it back in. Now it says unrecognizable files and it asks to format the mp3's I had bought and stored on the microsd card. In a pinch just to see if this would fix my issues I formatted the disc. Now I lost everything and it is still giving me issues. Read some similar issues from other customers, now I'm regretting my purchase. Save your money and headaches and buy something else!",
"Going on about two weeks now...LOVE IT Didn't think I'd like it, but I was SO wrong. So easy to use for a first time tablet user like me.",
"The Fire TV came well packaged with extremely simple instructions. Plug in the power cable and HDMI cable (not included), put batteries in the remote and that's it. After initial start up there is an update that must be run, but after a few minutes the unit was up and running. Interface is nice looking and easy to use. Voice search worked perfectly...it understood this Kentucky accent instantly. Flipping through the movie choices is super fast (almost too fast since it has skipped a movie a time or two). Netflix is on the home page, but you have to install the app before using it the first time. As I'm typing this review the unit is displaying some beautiful screensaver pictures while I have a movie paused. If you store your photos on Amazon's Cloud you can use your own pictures instead. Picture quality is fantastic and movies start up lightning fast. The only thing I see as a con would be how the Prime movies are marked. The placement of the Prime marker in the upper left of the movie icon is very small and isn't as prominent as it should be making it rather difficult to tell whether it's Prime or a movie you would rent/purchase. I figure in the days and weeks ahead Amazon will be listening to customer suggestions (as they usually do) and more and more updates will be forthcoming making this device even better. For me the Amazon Fire TV is a winner. It will definitely be replacing a Directv receiver I was using.Update: After one full day of using Amazon's Fire TV I am more than satisfied with my purchase.If you read reviews like I do make sure to skip over the ones that don't have the Amazon Verified Purchase listed under their name or click that their post is unhelpful. These are people who are trying to review a product without even having it in their possession. If you discount those reviews (which make the overall rating less than it should be) you will discover that the majority of people who actually purchased this product are very satisfied.4-6-14 Update: Added the AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable and this has added a whole new dimension to the sound quality of my tv. The sounds are more richer and louder than ever before. I am continually amazed at what this little device is capable of. I really suggest getting the cable I mentioned above to make your Fire TV experience even better4-8-14 Update: Turned on the device today and went to start up Netflix...all I got was a white screen. Turned the unit off and on, but still a white screen. I uninstalled the Netflix app and reinstalled and it worked again. I don't believe it was a problem on the device itself, but rather the app since all of the other apps worked fine.4-15-14 Update: Had the same white screen issue with Netflix some more. Contacted customer service and reported the issue. He stepped me through the process of going into the settings then the apps. When you come to Netflix instead of uninstalling click on force stop. This fixed the issue. If I have the problem again he asked that I contact them back immediately so that they can contact the developers with the issue. I continue to enjoy this device and have since gotten rid of the Directv receiver I had connected. I can't recommend the Fire TV enough6-25-14 Update: My Fire TV is still going strong and I am completely happy with it. I have found that I watch TV more so on The Fire than my DirecTV. The one thing I haven't checked (but will sometime) is the USB port. I've got to save some movies to my flash drive and see if I can play a saved movie from the drive using the USB port on The Fire. Finding Amazon content is a breeze using the Voice Search and searching through movies or videos using Netflix and others is fine. Yes, it would be great to be able to use the Voice Search with everything else, but it's not a deal breaker for me nor an inconvenience. I would imagine Amazon will eventually include their Voice Search on any third party application as time allows. Even after using it all this time I'm still amazed at the sound and picture quality of such a tiny device. For me Amazon just gets better and better.8-4-14 Update: I had movies saved to an external hard drive and I plugged it into the USB port on the Amazon Fire, unfortunately, it doesn't work. It basically did nothing. It made no noise like it was trying to access my hard drive nor did it recognize any USB plugged in. Hopefully Amazon will push out an update to fix this at some point and time. It would be a wonderful feature to have. (Hint, Hint...Amazon).",
"It works, fairly fast, definitely not 30MB/s fast when copying off of it via a USB 3.0 adapter, and absolutely much slower when writing to it. But that's true about all of these memory cards, it's just some are worse than others.",
purchased this as a christmas gift for our son in law. he loved it and works well. great sound and loves the portability of the unit.,
"Well, this card is pretty cool. I received one that says C10 instead of U1 (like this picture).  For what I use it, U1 won't work, so the one I received is C10.  I needed mine for a iON Air Pro camera, and the advertisements that &#34;supposedly&#34; say class10 on the page description, but it says U1 on the card won't work for the camera.I don't know why they don't call it Ultra 1 instead of falsely advertising it as a C10 when it really is a U1.  I was lucky to receive a C10, so it worked out, but it makes it more confusing for the other laymen.",
"If you like the Kindle Fire HD then you will love the Kindle Fire HDX. The new device runs three times faster, is lighter in weight, and the battery lasts slightly longer. The sound quality on this device is excellent and the display quality is absolutely stunning. Below are some of the features to expect from the Fire HDX. BUILD QUALITY---There is NO blue haze on the 8.9 HDX.---The build quality is excellent.---Auto contrast is good (not buggy).---Operating system is very intuitive except after downloading free prime videos to watch offline. If you remove the videos from your Carousel then, from the video menu, you must go to the left side bar, and click *downloads* to see your videos. PRIME DOWNLOAD ISSUES (free video download limitations)Prime members can download selected Prime Instant Videos to watch when not connected to the internet. There are major restrictions imposed on prime videos as listed below.---Not all Prime titles are available for download.---Most popular prime titles are NOT available for download.---There is a max of 25 titles that can be downloaded free at any one time.---Prime titles have a viewing period.---Viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the video, or 15-30 days (which ever comes first).---After the viewing period expires you need to reconnect to the internet.---Titles can be downloaded to only two separate devices at a time.---If you exceed the device quota then you must delete one of the titles before adding to another device.---There is no way to know which titles can be downloaded unless you have the HDX (amazon does not place a banner on the titles other than to say PRIME).Read more",
"Received my Amazon Fire TV 2 weeks ago. It works good very responsive with quad core but the interface seems very limited on apps the main ones are there Amazon of course, Net Flix, and a must have PLEX. but missing a lot of others, Still like ROKU 3 as a main streaming unit a little slower but chucked full of apps. Amazon needs to get with it if they are going to lead the pack here. also the speech search is not useable with Net Flix or any of the other apps only works with amazon. this is definitely loaded heavy on the amazon side, It makes no sense to have a great feature that cant work with the whole package.I would recommend to others but tell them of the draw backs so they know what they are getting in to here.Great product but needs some one to help it along.",
"than i expected. I don't know if it would kill any manufacturers to actually have a memory card or stick or device to actually HAVE Available the advertised capacity. Fortunately l learned that the advertised and actual available memory are TWO SEPARATE THINGS before i bought it, always scroll down and read the technical spec of a device or anything before you buy as that way ideally, your actually informed. Let the buyer beware, is more appropriate every day as most things are not exactly as they seem. And if it's food and cheap, it's likely cancer causing and don't feed your body and your car in the same place.",

"Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version. For my 7 version review, please search for my HDX 7 review.My profile: Im a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do. It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more",
No problems!,
"Well after using it last night and sleeping on it, (the experience... didn't actually sleep on my Fire TV) I had been debating between 4 and 5 stars. I am a longtime media streamer. I have 7 Rokus and have bought 3 more as gifts to family. I also have a Chromcast and an Xbox 360. Additionally I have tried various other streaming devices such as Netgear NeoTV, the D-Link MovieNite etc.(I am still trying to figure out why I bought the Chromecast the least useful gadget I have ever owned. )First of all the Fire TV is everything that Amazon claims it is. It is fast. It is sleek. The interface is handsome and of course very Kindle Fire like.After hooking it up it immediately downloaded updates. ( An annoying process that almost every new computing device does whether it is a phone, tablet, streamer, or computer. It seems to take forever but it is really not that long, it is just that we are in Christmas Morning opening presents mode and time slows down when you are excited about trying something new. -) )I give it 5 stars because Amazon delivered what it said it would. I doubt it will replace anyone's existing favorite. I would recommend it to anyone just entering the streaming media game and who has kids and Amazon Prime. It is a fantastic portal to Amazon products.Many people have tried to compare it to Roku, Apple, Chromecast etc but to me I compare it to my XBox. It plays Video, Music and Games so for some, who want to have a less expensive alternative to an XBox One, there it is. (Of course you cannot compare it XBox One or PS4 but not everyone wants to shell out 50 - 60 dollars for a game or 400-500 for a game console. This is plenty for the casual gamer or kids.)Being on the Android platform will allow the number of apps to increase exponentially and for watching Amazon's videos (Prime and Pay) it is perfect.About the experience....For Amazon's offerings it is the best out there. I highly recommend Amazon Prime as it is comparable to Netflix plus I have saved a bundle on free shipping. The interface for the movies is first class. The remote's FF and RW buttons also act as skip forward and skip back buttons. Press RW once to jump back 10 seconds or hold to rewind. Same for the FF button. The interface for Amazon video is similar to the new one for Netflix on Roku 3 with the entire screens background feature the highlight movie. Surprising the interface for Netflix on Fire TV is the older one not the new one.The Plex app works fine for all my DLNA needs. (playing media from my home computers)Wish list.1. Allow us to change the position of Apps. When you start adding apps the latest one is the first one on the list, so add them in reverse order to get your most frequently used ones at the top of the list. There is a row of tiles for Recently Watched that allow you remove from that list but it is kludgey. Those of you who have a kindle fire will recognize the system. Or add a quick Access or Favorites row of tiles at the top of the Home Screen.2. Would love to have Amazon tie into the Ultraviolet system. I have close to 200 movies there. You can reach it through the Flixster app but HD is not available on the Flixster app.3. HBOGo4. Vudu5. HBOGo6. Vudu7. HBOGo8. VuduAmazon....Get my pointIn summary I will keep it and use it for Amazon offerings. It will sit beside my Roku 3 which I will use for everything else until the apps on my Roku get ported to Fire. I do wish it had and infrared sensor so my Harmony remote could use it but it is not a showstopper.",
I have purchased and used several SanDisk memory cards and I have never experienced any issues with those cards.  One of my first choices when I am in the market for a memory card,
"This is a very fast card.  I have 2 or 3 of them now, and have had them for a few years, and they are all still working.",
"I used this upgraded card in my Razr Maxx HD and have been nothing but pleased with it. I haven't even come close to filling the entire card. I got it mostly because I keep my entire music library on my phone, about 5 gigs of music. It's a class 10 card so you won't see any lag in pulling up files. Great card for the price.",
"Works as expected and it was fast, I am hoping this survived being attached to the item it was bought for as it has met its end flying into a concrete wall - the android tablet it was attached to was suicidal oh well - would recommend to anyone - have fun..",
"My camera required it, the brand has a good history, my experience with the brand over years has been very good, the price was ok, buying via Amazon is the easiest, least aerobic way to go.  I've not found cards much cheaper from other brands and personally like to stick with those with which I have good experience.",
"All right so I was scrolling through the reviews and read some pretty ridiculous reasons to not give this tablet five stars. One such was that the tablet weighed a whole 3 oz more and that resulted in a 3 star review. Let me start off by saying if that is the reason for giving a crap review that is ridiculous. It says the tablet weight depends on the manufacturing. The other funny one is that someone is upset with the special offers on the front screen. That's why you get a cheap and good tablet. It even says in the discription that there will be ads on the lock screen. It takes a second to swipe up and unlock the screen. So the bad reviews are just reviews by people looking to nit-pick.This tablet is exactly what Amazon was describing. It is cheap, looks good, loads apps quickly, expandable storage, good speakers, decent screen and all while staying under 80 bucks.The start up didn't take long and it came preloaded with my account on it. For 80 dollars this is a good buy and the complaints on the wieght and the ads are ridiculous reasons to give this tablet a shabby review.Buy this tablet if you want a cheap e-reader that can also sure the web, watch movies and shows, check Facebook or Twitter, or read books on. Ignore the negative reviews and you won't be disappointed.",
"For the price, this is the bast for android phone, very fast and holds alot of stuff on it.I would recomend this for phone or for camera",
Works great in my Samsung Note 2 and Samsung Ativ 500T. Just slide it in and nothing else to do!,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
I have this in my phone storing the majority of my MP3 collection (400+ albums). It loaded 30Gs of music comparatively fast. And never seem to have any problems with skipping or stuttering I've had with slower cards. Probably would be a solid selection for video (I haven't tried it yet) and photos save off quickly allowing follow-up shots I would have missed before.,
"This product sucks.  My phone keeps giving me a ""card removed"" please re-insert or something like that! Only to find out that they do have that problem (32gb sd's and higher micro sd card ultra class 10).  Complained to company and it's taking forever for them to ship me a new one.  Many mistakes happened with my new items and inconvenient.  Better to have just returned it with ""Amazon"" got the money back and bought a different one!!!  Company sucks! you would think Sandisk is a reputable name but "":$)($)(*. I bought 2 cards from them 32g and 64g and both have problems.",
"What's more to say, this is the biggest MicroSDXC card at the time with the reliability of Sandisk with great speed.  I have one in all of my tablets and both mobile phones.  I have yet to have an issue with this card and don't expect to.",
"I had to use fat32format.exe in order to fully use this card in my Samsung Galaxy S3. The card comes with exFAT format, which doesn't work when trying to use the card with recovery to load custom ROMs.",
I had a regular 32GB card that I used with my BlackBerry Torch 9810. It was slow though. I replaced it with this card and I can definitely see the difference in speed on my Z10. Very happy with it! The only thing I had to do was to format the card with my BlackBerry Z10 and that was it.,
"Quick shipment, product as described.  Comes with adapter which will come in handy.  SanDisk is a great product, it usually delivers quality item.",
"I use this with my GoPro Hero 3 camera and it works great, no issues and perfect size and price.",
I bought it for a Tablet. I like having the capacity for music movies and files. I have purchased this model before and never had a problem,
"It works fine in my phone.  The phone detected errors when first used and I was worried, but I let the phone reformat it and all is good.  Excellent for the price.Beware it may not work in older devices.",
"Alot of storage for a great price. Only one probkem: since I installed this card into my Samsung Galaxy Note 3, about once a month or so, when I turn the phone on in the morning it gets stuck in some sort of &#34;boot loop&#34; and hangs on the AT&T logo screen. My phone is stock, and I have altered the software in no way. Granted, I cannot be sure that the card is the cause of this problem, but if I remove it and then boot the phone, it works properly. I love SanDisk products, and I will definitely continue to buy them. Just a word of warning.",
"I am very happy with this micro sd, I'm using a galaxy note 10.1 and the truth is very fast, copies files quickly.",
"The supplied card with the R8 is 2GB, that only holds about 6 songs.  I had to keep deleting projects to make room for new ones.  Solution: Get a larger capacity card.  It also makes selecting, saving, and deleting projects faster.  No problems after 1 month of use.",
"Simply put, this little micro works great. I plugged it into my Lumia 2520 and it was immediately recognized. The speed of getting files to and from it seems good. The price is great and I have always been a fan of the SanDisk brand. If it does fail in the next couple years (which I doubt) I will update the review but as of now the device is exactly as advertised.",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
It's amazing to have a 128gb micro sd. Works with my Samsung Note2. I am using it on my YOGA 2 Pro with modified nifty minidrive,
This is the second one I have purchased from Amazon and I have had great service from the first one I bought 6 months ago.  It is fast and fits perfectly in MS Surface computers.,
For the one that are afraid of buying it to use with your tablet: good news. Is tiny piece of memory works fine with samsung galaxy note N8000. I had to do nothing. Just plug it. no problems at all. It runs smooth so far.,

"I received the SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card as estimated by Amazon on time as promised. The card showed a formated size of 29.71 GB in my Samsung Galaxy EK-GC100 camera, which I was very satisfied with. I purchased my camera at the same time which I also received on the same day. I've used the camera and memory card several times since then on setup and getting familiar with both products and am very pleased with the performance of both. Thank you Sandisk and Amazon.com",
"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.",

"This works on my phone and is amazing, however it seems to transfer pretty slowly.  I move a lot of music and movies on and off my phone so it can be annoying.  I'm not sure if my phone or this card is the weak link though.  I have Note 2.Anyways, it was cheap and it works, that is all that matters.  Buy it!!!",
"This was purchased for my cell phone. It was easy to plugged in, and my phone recognized it instantly.The adaptor that comes with the device I had some problems with. The adaptor has a write protection switch, that both my Toshiba and HP laptops like to turn on while inserting it into the SD slot. To get around this I have to insert this adaptor at a slight angle, and apply a little pressure to try and not let that switch get changed on insertion. It works, but it is a pain. Fortunately since the chip is in my phone 99% of the time it is not a pain I deal with too often. It is something that may need to be considered though if you plan on using this device primarily in the standard sized SD slot of a laptop or computer.",
I put this in a Sprint Galaxy S3. Mounted it and used it. Still using it. More storage than I will ever need.,
"Well not much to say...its a good mmc and its fast enough and that's about all you can ask for, using for more storage on my tablet.Update: stopped working after a while, computer said the mmc had an error and after an hour I could not fix, it became locked and would not unlock with any sd adapters I used and because its locked it would not format or erase and wouldn't even read because of the error. It stopped working after amazons very short return policy so I was out of luck with them, luckily SanDisk has a very long (10-lifetime) for its ultra brands, even though it was a hassle and all through email only I got a replacement and that's why I only took one star off",
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
32 GB on top of my 16GB from my Samsung  S4.  Memory Card with adapter included.  Fit exactly on my phone.  Price was lower than buying in another phone store.,
"Installed this in my Droid Bionic.I just backed up all my data using the included card reader adapter and the card reader slot on the laptop, and copied all data to a folder on my PC. Once done, reversed the process to my new micro sd card.Bionic recognized additional memory, some apps had to run updates, after adding card though this i don't attribute to the card itself it seems likely the apps were referencing something specific with hardware maybe.After the updates programs ran as expected.I did have one issue with PowerAMP media player where all the playlists dissapeared. not sure why and havent yet researched this in the PowerAMP forums. I assume this same issue would occur with any card upgrade.",
"I got it, formatted it for my phone, and it seems to be working perfectly.  I am able to transfer and open files at a good speed, and I have had no problems with it.  Good product!",
"This sd card arrived quickly and did the job in my phone. I was having strange issues with my phone and some error messages with my card, that reformatting couldn't fix. This did the job! I have had great, reliable success with sandisk and will continue to use them.",
"awesome! Worked well with the Surface 2 tablet.I later return the Surface 2 tablet , since it didn't seem like that I needed it but I made sure to take out the memory card :)Never had any issues with it though when I had it.",
"This is my 4th unit that I had purchased from SanDisk. Used it in a Sony Z Tablet, Note 2, S4, Q10 and most recently the Sony Z1 smartphone. Data transfer speeds are quick and you get consistent transfers without any errors.A worth buy!",
"First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory. It would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage, go buy a computer.Display: One word, amazing. Maybe I am pushing it, but the screen is so clear. I own an iPhone 5 and my eyes prefer my kindle. I love reading on this machine and for the price, amazon did a good job with this one.Read more",
"I was able to plug it in, use the format utility and it worked just fine (this is on the galaxy s3).  Now every ounce of my ripped CD's are on my phone with 32gb  to spare.  Not much else to say.",
"I love the ultras cause it writes fast to the card with my samsung S3 with not much time in between pics.  I also got one for my Fuji waterproof camera and it takes a few seconds before I can take another photo but that is the limitation of the processor of the camera, not the card. Overall, I love it.  My computer can read them fast and videos are played back at real speed",
The device works as advertised. It had a tremendous price. I have found that it did not need formatting to work in my Galaxy Note 3. The amount of space reserved for my purposes was most excellent. I would definitely buy this device again.,
"I know armed with this in my Android tablet and wearing my three wolf tshirt, I will be the envy of all geek girls who will be uncontrollably attracted to my Asian maleness.",
"This thing is quick, no waiting for things to load. The free app has a good UI and is actually helpful unlike a lot of free apps.",
"If price is also double of 64 GB card, then it goes straight to my shopping cart. Otherwise it will remain in my wish list.",
I replaced a 64GB card in my note 3 with this 128GB card and everything seems to be working just fine as expected.  I've been using the card for about a week.,
"Super low price for expanding the storage for your BN HD+ Nook. Buy the 16GB version & save money, then spend a few bucks on this microSD card & double your storage. Use the adapter to easily pop into your laptop or PC and easily transfer files when you are on the go. Better yet, buy two.",

Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",

"UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more",
"I use this in a high def camcorder to record 1080p video.  I've had no problems with clipping.  The card seems well able to quickly handle the amount of data that gets pumped to it.  I've not had any quality control issues or data loss, either.  Would definitely buy again.",
"fast transfer rates, I downloaded about 2GB of videos form the card to my laptop through a card reader, all in about a minute",
"Much improved screen!It turns out that the 49.95 Fire 7 version released two years ago didn't have an IPS screen.Now it does.Technically, both the old one and this new one are just 171 ppi (pixels per inch) but this one seems much crisper than the first generation 49-er.My eyes don't lie. IPS makes the screen a lot crisper!There's also a stunning improvement in color quality with the new screen. Now it holds its own with the 62 color gamut original iPad Mini before, it wasn't anywhere near.Mind you it's not current Apple screen quality, or current high-end Samsung screen quality - but what is It's only 49.95, and it's good enough. Heck, at 49.95, its MORE than good enough, it's great. It blows away just about any entry level consumer laptop screen, that's for sure.I pulled out my 2015 first-gen, 49.95 Fire 7 - the one this replaces - and placed it side by side with this new one. The colors (including a horrific green tint on white backgrounds) on the old one weren't video-worthy - ok for casual videos on Facebook and YouTube, maybe, but not good enough for Netflixing and Amazon Prime.This new one, though It's movie-worthy, especially with earphones (ok, ONLY with earphones). I'd prefer 720p over the Fire 7's 600p (600p is better than 480p DVD's, but not ask good as even entry-level - 720p - HDTV quality), but overall even at 600p it's eminently watchable.By the way, for me streaming video content on Amazon Prime Instant Video has been noticeably sharper than streaming YouTube. I think Amazon Prime adapts to 600p (max for this tablet) while YouTube is is probably delivering only 480p (remember YouTube's defaults are 360p/480p/720p and up).Read more",
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
"I bought this speaker after looking at other speakers from Bose and Beats. I purchased this one because it had great sound, but also because it was cheaper than competitors and had many additional capabilities via Alexa voice control. I love the ability to walk around the house and use streaming services via voice. It's great than I can carry just the speaker and not have to rely upon a phone app to change songs, playlists, volume, etc. The Alexa voice recognition works very well--it seems to be more accurate than Siri. I frequently ask Alexa what song is playing. I also ask Alexa to search for certain songs that I want to hear. If not in my library, it will play from Prime Music, similar to the way Apple Music functions. Additional voice features I use are news reports, weather forecasts, and control of WeMo switches in my home. Overall a great buy.",
Card works fine at 1080p on my Gopro Hero 3 plus.  Works great in my Transend USB 3.0 reader as well.,
"Got this for use with the Dell Venue 32GB.  With a smaller hard drive space, it was critical for all downloads, videos, photos, etc to be on the microSD.  Speed is more than adequate.  Great deal for $20",
"This is a 'set-it-and-forget-it' item. Solid performance without issues. I forgot it is still in my Sony camera, Love it",
"There is something to be said about SanDisk. You plug it in and it just works. I've never had one be DOA or any memory issues throughout the years, both for my camera and storage products. I installed this in my Galaxy SIII and it recognized it right away and I was able to dump my music onto it. Speed seems great as well, no complaints.",
Great case. Fits kindle fire perfect.,
"I used it for something like 10 months in my Galaxy S III (GT-I9305) with original firmware, mainly for pictures and flac files.Suddenly I perceived that the last pictures I took disappeared; I took some more pictures as I thought that were software problems but same problem until I realized that the card was not working. Now I can't write it anymore or delete information, format it, delete partition, etc. Now is a ROM. The bright side is that I did not lose valuable information like pictures that now are permanently stored in the card.",
"fast delivery, good speeds, and good price make this a good micro sd to buy. got pretty nice speed considering im using a kinda crappy mobo and older usb slots.",
Wanted to test some things on an old Android phone. This worked perfectly. Don't use the phone any more so will now use it for my camera. We'll see.,
This little memory card is quite fast and it gives me a ton of expansion storage on my Galaxy S3. File transfers from the phone's internal storage or over a USB connection to my PC from the card when it it's in my phone are a lot faster than I anticipated. The included adapter for using the microcard in a PC SIM Card Slot doesn't work. I've tried reading the microcard using the full size SIM  adapter in three different PC's and had  no luck at all. I think the adapter is just junk.,
"I got this for the Sports-Vue 360HD action camera. It works fine. It came with a converter to standard SDHC size/format. I used that to transfer files from the video camera to my XP pro PC. It does fine. I left the card in its FAT32 format and it works without a hitch. It's very small, so you must exercise care not to set it down or drop it and lose it. I'm happy with this item and would recommend it/purchase it again. In fact, I purchased 2.",
I have used this in my smart phone for about 5 months with no problems.  I read other reviews on the specifics and decided that this was the best option.  I have not had any issues and would recommend this product.,
I am familiar with Sandisk and the quality of product is obvious to me because it installed in my Lumia 820 and it works great.,
This  device was bought  for a  Galaxy Tab 10.1 and  it  works  well with it. The price was  decent and  I  have not  had  any  issue  with the disk.,
What can I say.  It was a good price and a large capacity card.  It hasn't posed any problems and I use it every day in my Galaxy Note II.,
"Maximize your storage now with this product. Installed easily, even for tablet new-bees. The tablet recognized it-no problem. And I'm pretty techno challenged, but have used it for picture storage and successful transferring data from the device.",
It works as Expected. No problems installing or anything. It fits my Samsung S4. It shipped really fast and was in packaging that I could open without the use of something sharp.,
"This is a great card and holds all of my fun items :-).  I have a mass of ebooks that don't take up much room, and I also get to store my favorite movies on it as well.",
I have a Samsung Note 8 tablet and by adding this 64 GB SD card it saved me quite a bit as I did not have to move to 32 GB internal disk - - Simply just slipped the 64 GB into SD slot and off we go.,
"This is very good memory for GoPro. Went with 32GB because my brother, who has two GoPro cameras, said he never filled up his 32 so why go for 64? Anyway, this is versatile enough to go in phone or camera, I ordered two more.",
"Good fast-access memory card. I use it in my Roku player, but it would work equally well in any device that required a micro card.",

"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",

My wife just loves taking pictures on her Galaxy S4 and was filling up the internal memory. Popped this baby in and now she has tons more room. Always a good idea to keep your pics on an external just in case the phone crashes that your pictures are saved.. Too bad apple doesn't offer that feature...,

"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",
"Best sounding Amazon speaker hands down. The only annoyance is that it beeps after the ""Alexa"" wake word and after the command, unlike the other echos I have with no obvious way to turn this off. Other than that, sounds great and can take with you pretty well anywhere....",
16+16GB=32GB. Lasts long time! Waaaaaaay cheaper than the 32GB version of the S3/iP4S/iP5! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Or get the 32GB for 48GB total...,
"I researched online and found that this is a true Class 10 micro SD card. Manufacturers can use different calculations to be able to list a &#34;Class 10&#34; rating that is, in truth, a lie. This is the real deal.",
again just what you need to get those shots. you can never have enough memory cards. really glad I was able to get one,
"Whenever I get these cards, the first thing I do is connect it to my Windows 7 or 8 computers, and run this program to format it to FAT32.  Here's the link to the free program:[...]Many phones, cameras and tablets, need the card to be in FAT32 format, and sadly, it's not an option in Windows these days.  You can select NTFS or exFAT, but no option for FAT32 when it comes to this card.Using that program, you can format the card, then load it with whatever music or videos, and the card will work fine in your device.The 4 cards I have have never failed me in the past year, recommended :)",
"I use it in my Samsung Glaxy S3 to increase more GB. The device has 16 GB, now increase to 48 GB.",
This is the one to get after Amazon's update to have the device always on. It also has the best speaker of the three.,
Already have a few other Alexas. Wanted on to be portable around the house without having to plug in or connect to another speaker. Works as expected.,
"This is a SanDisk Ultra 16 GB MicroSDHC Class 10, that means that it is a fast card.  You cannot beat the price, unless you buy a slower card.  Great quality, great name, & outstanding price.

Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
I have gotten up to 15(expecting 30 is unrealistic I suppose) and consistently gotten 11 to 13 MB/s with this which is fast enough so that it only takes a few minutes to transfer 20GB at a time. Good little SD card for a good price. I have and will continue to reccomend this microSD. Using in my EVO LTE phone.,
"I received my Fire TV today, I am surprised, amazed, thrilled and extremely pleased it's all that and a bag of chips The ease of use is so simple, hookup is a breeze, I had it hooked up and running with in 3 minutes The remote is small so what, My only con is: the voice search should be for everything. To own this and not have Amazon Prime should be a crime, LOL, it's a must for the Fire TV. I gave up Direct TV in January, I was paying to much for what I was getting. With the Fire TV it's customized tv at your finger tips, no more paying for channels you don't need and no more cable bill I hope more people are waking up and ditching pay tv. I pay 7.99 for Netflix, I watch Crackle for free, no more commercials, no more unwanted/un needed channels, movies when I want, sit-coms when I want. no more running to 'pick up' a dvd, I'm telling ya streaming is where it's at and this device is a must Life is hard, this is easy.",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
I bought this to expand the memory in my HTC Evo 4G LTE phone. Works great and the adapter is a nice touch.,
Very fast reading and writing for my samsung galaxy s4 from verizon. Highly recommended. Sandisk is numero uno for smartphones.,
I plugged this into my Galaxy S3 and the memory was read immediately without having to reformat the disc or do any other preparation. It was just plug and play. 32GB was plenty of space to put my music collection and still have space for recording HD video (in addition to the on board hard disc of the phone). The phone even prompted me as to change the default location of photos and videos.,
"Hi guys I have wrote this review three times and unfortunately doesn't go through on Amazon's website...LOLSo, with that said I will tell you that the write and read speeds are very fast and should be with the class 10.  Great price and fast delivery from Amazon!...Enjoy!",
This product has served me well for the last two months.  It has a lot of storage and it was reasonably priced.,
Nice deal on the 64GB mirosd card. These are ideal for cellphones and the storage space is immense for those like me that need it. Just wish the price was lower for the 128GB ones.,
"I am in south America and heare docen't work like Apple TVApple TV is very easy, you see everything in one page.The Amazon fire Tv control is very nice.",
"not much to say about this, ordered it to put into my new Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet, plugged it in and it works as advertised. Nuff said!",
"got it at a great price and it worked great, was a little upset with the tiny size of the packaging as i almost didnt even see it on my step, it arrived in a 1/4&#34; thick cardboard envelope that was about 3&#34; by 2&#34;.",

"I ordered a 64 Gig card, and the card received states it is a 64 Gig card, though it only hold 28 Gigs of Data! I got ripped off. I did not check it until after the 30 days had passed. But it appears to be some sort of scam. The card is clearly marked 64 gigs, and I have checked the card in two tablets, and two computers it is only a 32 Gig card.Edit: The company directed me to a tool to reformat this card and I was able to get close to my 64 gigs of data, though I do not like using third party tools. I have Windows, Mac and Linux systems and any of those OS's should have been able to format this card correctly. I will minus a star for having to use a third party tool. Otherwise these are great cards.",
"I've been using this in my BlackBerry Z10 for movies, music & pictures for the past few months without issue. Quick response, no lag or compatibility issues.",
"Card is perfect for use in GoPro. Write's fast and provides for super fast transfers to the computer. Price for two of these was the same as one 64GB card so the decision was easy. I'd rather have two cards so that I can swap them out, continue to record and have someone else transfer from the other one.",
"I first tried putting it in my camera, without formatting.  It just said &#34;insert another card&#34;.  I put it into my linux computer, and it output lots of errors in the syslog, and fsck wouldn't work at all, just error'ed out, so I couldn't even format it.My windows computer couldn't recognize it either, though it tried to format it.  My phone didn't give any errors, but I wasn't able to really test it there.  (I do wonder if just the mini to standard adapter is the problem, since my phone has a mini slot, and everywhere else that I tried it needed the adapter...Exchanging for a different brand, and I'll see what happens.",
I have not had any problems with this product and it works as it is supposed to so I would buy again.,
"If you were looking for a class 10 microsd card in order to DIRECTLY transfer files from your PC to your phone the fastest way possible you can go with a cheaper class 4 instead of this one. The speed is not much different than other class 4 microsd cards I've had. It's very far from the 30mb/s they promise, I got only about 4.5mb/s AT MUCH, and after a few minutes it's downhill from there. I tested on both windows and linux and didn't see a difference. Luckily there's not a lot of difference in price between a high quality class 4 and this one but then again, maybe I didn't look at the class 4 the way I should have since I was focused on getting a class 10. Oh well, you've been warned. Don't expect magic from this card.UPDATE 12/11/2013: Sandisk proactively answered this review to ask me to contact them. The reason I didn't contact them first it's because you usually receive slimy answers from this tech support and hardly any solution or help. It is indeed a waste of time. After sandisk comment I contacted them through one of their live chat agents and this is the interchange. My suspicious were confirmed and I indeed wasted my time:Daniel S.: Hello, thank you for contacting SanDisk. My name is Daniel S..

Bought this for my Microsoft Surface Pro for extra storage and it works great I just put it in the slot and it showed up in my computer just like it was supposed to.,
I have the Echo and bought this one for the bedroom. Great alarm clock.,
We bought to give away at a Halloween party. We own them ourselves and they are awesome,
Work perfect in my GoPro camera. I have always found San Disk are the best. I would definitely buy again.,
"I own a first generation Microsoft Surface Pro 128, and it has been a good machine but I was really finding it challenging working within the constraint of 128GB of storage space. I had a 64GB Class 10 SDXC card, which worked well but was not going to fit the VMWare virtual machine I wanted to run off the SD storage. The Virtual Machine increases in size with regular use, and the operating system I was running is recommended for at least 40GB of max storage to operate properly.  Combined with the files I needed to store, and 64GB memory chip was no longer sufficient.The SanDisk Ultra 128GB MicroSDXC Class 10 Memory Card was able to handle that with ease, however I have found that the virtual machine ran noticeably faster off the 64GB chip than this one. I've actually ordered a second of these to see if I might have just received a flawed chip. If the replacement chip offers improvement I will revise this review. It provides its main selling point, more storage at a relatively low cost, so far has run reliably in my tablet computer.If storage space is a significant issue for your device and the memory can make use of 128GB SDXC, then I would recommend product.",
"I still think i have sometimes problem reading with the memory, but i can't prove it, still works, never had an error by reading or writing, so 4 stars for you!",
"Love having all this extra space available. Sux that in future phones, Android is moving away from SD slots. I love having physical storage available, if I delete something from the cloud I can't recover it. With this that's not a worry.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is because sometimes it feels a little slow. but it's nothing I can't deal with.",
I've had two of these cards so far. Neither of them were recognized by Mac or PC. I am able to use it but only if I leave it in the Gopro camera and hook up the Gopro to the Mac via USB. It will not work as a normal SD card and needs to be used with the camera. I can not recomend this card at all. I had the first card replaced because it was defective. Now the second card is defective also. I don't have the time to play around with another return so I will just not ever buy Sandisk again.,
bought for garmin gps. works very well. also has adapter for sdhc size memory card to plug into reader if you don't have a micro card reader,
"I love everything about this case except for how it fits on the Echo Dot. I was expecting a snug fit however, it is very lose and so you have to make sure that if you pick it up to move it (and the power cable is disconnected), the dot will fall out of the case.",
"I mounted the SanDisk Ultra 64GB MicroSDXC card in a Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet as a data drive.  The card was instantly recognized by the tablet, and there is no apparent delay with read/write operations.The card (I ordered the 'easy open' package) came with an SD adapter that allows the card to be used as a 'regular size' SD card.Recommended.",
"This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface. Use your cell phone or computer and buy an Echo Dot.",
I shopped for a long time until I found this and I am very pleased.,
"This is great for the beach or by the pool. If you already own an Echo, this is a great addition to the household.",
"Do not get this card especially if you plan on using it on an Android phone.  just google ""sd card unexpectedly removed"" and I found the problem is caused directly by this card.  I purchased a different brand and the problem immediately disappears.  Out of curiosity I tried mounting this card into a windows PC and on rare occasions the sd card does turn up empty, as if it was removed, so the problem is not limited to android.  I would avoid this card completely.",
I love this product.  The space is perfect for my device and it runs really fast.  I thought it came at a great price too.  I highly recommend this product!,
"Downloaded eraseUS and formatted to fat32 with 32k clusters.  Mounted to either 7 or 10 with no problem, see nada instability.  But that's not the coool thing.  I actually have two of these.  One is in the sd slot, one is in the power port via the samsung sd/usb adapter.  Soooo, my 16g 10 is actually a 145gb 10.  I can't imagine what I will actually do with all that, but I have it.  Maybe run a Linux port and web server (just because I can).  Too bad about that external storage limit on iOS....",
"I got my first Kindle. This is a nice ebook reader. I'm going to jump right in and tell you what I found to be its Pros and Cons. Then I'm going to tell how it compares to its biggest competitor, the Barnes Noble Nook Simple Touch.Kindle's Pros:Great Screen: Many people do not find LCDs hard to read on (e.g. smartphones, tablets, Kindle Fire, Nook Color, etc.), but virtually everyone will find E-Ink easier to read, any time of day. Especially the newest E-Ink Pearl displays. They simply look like paper and ink. I have never experienced any eye strain reading E-Ink book readers, but I have with LCD based phone/tablet screens.Thin and Lightweight: This Kindle is thinner than any paperback and lighter too. This makes it very easy to hold in a sitting position, and for long periods too. It also makes it easy to transport in a purse, backpack, or messenger bag (or in luggage for traveling). Many people like to take a few books when travelling, and this Kindle lets you take as many as you want and adds virtually nothing to your travel burden.Good Value: Even without a touchscreen, the Kindle is a good value. It is a well-made product, it offers cloud storage of your books (and well it should, since it offers no ability to expand storage capacity with an add-in microSD card), the screen is excellent, Amazon is a dogged competitor in book pricing. The Kindle 4 is the best value of Amazon's E-Ink readers. Some may be tempted to get the version with the built-in light. If you can afford it, sure, go ahead. But let me point out you don't have to spend 20 for a fancy-schmancy book light. Your local dollar store has them for ... wait for it ... a buck.Read more",
I have used this to store recorded video information from a dash camera.  I have had no problems so far.,
"This card was able to transfer all my pictures, movies, music, and toast from my hard drive to my cell phone very fast. Although, I don't necessarily believe that you need the fastest card for your cell phone, if you can afford it, I would get it. Having a snappy cell phone being able to process and write to an SD card extremely fast makes you happy.",
"WOW. Transfer speeds on this MicroSD were phenomenal. I was using it on a Galaxy S2, and transferring everything from music to movies from the phone to my computer were fast. I mean a song per blink fast. The acronyms are getting a little crazy now (SD = Secure Digital, SDHC = Secure Digital High Capacity) and the 1 on the lower left means Ultra High Speed 1. Even I don't know what that means yet, but this thing is F-A-S-T.",
after 3 months would not read at all. Used all sorts of card readers and computers and internals went completely dead. Strange for a product from this company but i guess it happens. May not happen to you but since it's a high capacity would that mean it's more susceptible to becoming corrupted? Would not buy again. (maybe a 16gb),
"This review is for the second generation Kindle Paperwhite. Like all kindle e-readers before it, this is a great product. However, I am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year's model. For this review, I focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new Paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year's model. Also, I found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising, so I will try to clear them up.HARDWAREDesign - The Kindle white has a nice look and shape. It fits well and is easy to hold in one hand. It's fairly light, so it doesn't tire the hands too much. I can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands. Its design is very similar to the previous Paperwhite - almost identical. The height and width are the same, the buttons are in the same location, and although this version is slightly lighter, it is not noticeable.Display - Although not a huge improvement from last year's model, the display is one of the best features of the Paperwhite. Like most e-readers, the Paperwhite uses digital ink technology. This model employs a more advanced version. In addition, the lighting has been upgraded, so among other things, it is more evenly lit. Together, they make for incredible viewing. In my opinion, it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. I really enjoy reading on it, text look very sharp and crisp, with little to no eye strain.Processor - The Paperwhite has an upgraded processor, which means smoother page turns and navigation. I am able to open books, flip pages, and navigate menus fairly quickly. There is barely any lag as I flip through many pages at a time. Also, the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all.Read more",
"Shipped as described, Was very easy to add to phone. Works perfect for pictures on my cell phone. Allows me to do more videos with no worries about memory.",
"There really isn't much to say about this card other than it's been very reliable and handles HD video from my GoPro Hero 3 very well and without a glitch.I'm not offering any benchmarks or other measurements of speed in comparison to other Class 10 MicroSD cards. All I can tell you is that this card has yet to fail me and I am a longtime video professional who works in a commercial/advertising/marketing environment, so I need things to be reliable for all of my clients.Recording and transferring video from device to computer is a snap and I've had no issues with it since I began using it.",
I wanted to get a portable Bluetooth speaker that I could use while out as well as at home. The tap has great sound quality and Alexa is more useful than I would have thought.,
"As good as the Echo is, the Echo Voice Remote seems to leave much to be desired. Whereas the Echo Dot recognizes my voice immediately and correctly interprets my commands consistently, the Voice Remote is far less likely to do so. Sometimes I'm not even heard at all. I often have to repeat commands several times before the Echo responds to me. Plus the volume control on the remote is slow to respond. And I don't mean a millisecond slow. The volume won't change for several seconds after the button is pushed.Yes, this is the New Generation Voice Remote.Aha! You say. You must be too far away from the Echo Dot.Granted, I am on the other side of the house when I use the Voice Remote. However, that doesn't explain why the shuffle button works immediately and correctly--every time. Plus doesn't Amazon brag on the device's great range If it was a distance problem, wouldn't the shuffle button have the same connectivity issue No, either I have a bad remote or the Voice Remote doesn't work as effectively and effortlessly as the Echo Dot itself. That's too bad.*** UPDATE ***I discovered that there is a trick to being understood when you use the Voice Remote, but it also comes with a gotcha. When you press down and hold the Talk Button on the Voice Remote, it's the equivalent of using the wake word on the Echo itself (Alexa, for example.) Since you can't see the LEDs on the Echo respond to the wake word, the Echo makes a tone to let you know that it's listening. There is a second a different acknowledgement tone after you release the Talk button. The Echo now knows that you have finished with your command or question.Read more",

Been using this card in my Nokia Lumia 820 for over a year now. It gives decent speed and works good. No issues at all.,
Got it on sale for the Samsung Galaxy Note II and it works great! Also came with an adapter which i believe will let you use it on your Wii or 3DS.,

I did not use the adapters as I just connect my phone and tablet to my laptop via USB to transfer music, photos and music.",
"I formatted this card as NTFS...loaded it up with a bunch of my kids' favorite movie and TV shows. Transfers seem to be pretty speedy, even while playing HD content.",
"I purchased this to expand the internal memory of my smart phone, specifically the Galaxy S3.  It performs absolutely flawlessly.  If you have any reservations about this micrSD...don't. There's no need to format since it comes pre formatted. Should you desire to format,  do it from within the phones settings and again, no issues.  PLEASE, turn the phone off and remove the battery before installation...lol",
First rate - high quality!,
"There is not much to review other than how it works - so far it has been just as hoped.  The read/write time is very fast, and I have had no issues.  I am currently using in a camera and it give basically unlimited pics and video due to the size so is great when travelling.",
"Great microsdhc card,  use it on my phone for extra storage.  I have used this brand in the past and it works great.  Never a problem with ScanDisk.",
I'm not sure what I can say about this that will be helpful. We bought this 6 months ago. It worked when we bought it. It's still working. I can't say anything about speed since we haven't tested it. We've never had any issues with speed though. I trust SanDisk. Everything we've bought from them has been good.,
this works great. ive saw ppl getting fakes at times. this was not the case. it worked in my evo 4g with formatting. turned it into two different 32 gig files but works as one. ive got more memory on my phone than i do on my laptop which is crazy.,
"The product works exactly as promised.  I installed in my Samsung Galaxy S III without any issues.  Now all of my photos, videos, and music are on it so no worries about using my main memory for those data intense items.",
Definitely needed more memory for my phone.  This is plenty of storage and was purchased at a very affordable price.,
We bought this Amazon Tap Bluetooth and wifi wireless speaker for my brother. He loves it! He can play his fave tunes by the pool and it really holds a charge for hours of wireless listening.,
"if you need a good sd card this works perfect for you smart phones, has all the memory you will need, very fast transfer rate",
the phone that memory resides plays video and media fast.  Sandisk always makes excellent products and for memory it is leader.,
"DON'T BUY a reburbished Kindle. I've had to return them, twice. Apparently, Amazon's definition of refurbish is to take a Kindle with some problem or defect, simply repackage it and send out again to see if some different customer might take it off their hands.Both times, the 'refurbished' Kindles shorted out in different ways. The Kindles especially liked to misfunction while I was in the middle of working out at the gym.",
"Works great, sound is clear and is really loud. Would recommend",
I use this in my Trailcam and it works great. I take an old camera with me in the woods to just flip through the pics and delete.,
This does exactly what you would expect from a 32GB MicroSD memory card. Plenty of storage and fast access times make this a solid purchase.,
"Good price, works flawless in my Samsung S4! Normal SanDisk quality! That is why I go with this brand and only this brand..",
"Great for HD video or high definition cameras, or long-term time-lapse photography projects. Very pleased and would recommend it to others.",
I bought the Tap to integrate with the Echo. It is ideal for my husbands office where he can use it on his desktop in easy reach for music or to contact Alexa. The wireless feature is great but having sound activation would make this product perfect!,
"Wanted a larger faster card for my razr maxx, running on CM11/Android 4.4.  For the price this card was the best option.  My phone had no problem using it in the default exfat partition.  Is much faster than my old card.  No problems with it.  Couldn't be happier.",
"I bought this card for my Galaxy S4, but with the included adapter I can also use it in my Canon 6D in a pinch. As it meets UHS-1 spec it can keep up with the cameras buffer.There are plenty of details in these reviews regarding transfer rates, etc so I won't revisit that. I have had no issues with the card overheating, it performs exactly as I expected. The price was also fantastic.I would recommend this card to anyone for a wide variety of reasons. It is fast, has a good warranty and comes with the adapter to use in regular sized SD card slots.",
"I bought this for my grandson to use in his GoPro camera; he says it works great, and if he is happy, all is good. He is quite knowledgeable and critical of all things technical, so if he says it is good, it is good. And the price on Amazon was good too with free Prime shipping",

Went with the portable unit for travel. Easy access and portability.,
"When I first inserted the card in my computer it wouldn't recognize it.  Had to &#34;jiggle&#34; it around in the card reader, and then it took a long time for my computer to finally recognize something was there.  When I tried to read and/or format the card it kept telling me &#34;There is no disc installed in removable drive E&#34;.  I wasted a lot of time trying to find a cause/fix before I tried a different SD adapter.  As soon as I changed adapters the card worked perfectly.",
"I have used this in a number of devices, including mobile phones. When recording HD video straight to the card, I have not encountered the skips, lags or stutters that I have sometimes seen with other cards. So it certainly must be fast enough for this purpose.",
"Got a really good deal on this humongous capacity card on Black Friday, Thanks Amazon, been waiting for the price to go down.Using this on a Galaxy S3 as FAT 32. I was unable to get this recognized in the phone as an ExFat. Anyone having problems with this in the Galaxy Lineup of phones might want to try the FAT 32 formatting.",

"I own the Echo, and love the product! So I purchased the Tap as a gift.",
"I use this in my Samsung Galaxy S5 to store my photos, videos, and other data. Stores and retrieves quickly and greatly expands the capacity of my phone.",
"I bought this to use with my go pro hero 3 black edition. It requires a class 10 MicroSDXC card. So far I've had no issues with it. Fast read/write, came with adapter, small packaging, but that's all it needed! Comes with a nice hard plastic case to keep both dry and together if needed.",
If you have Prime this is the best thing you can buy!,
"Memory arrived intact delivery was fast and I use it now with my galaxy i9505 LTE s4, funciana to perfection and longer will be able to record all my videos",
"I'm always happy with a SanDisk purchase. I am currently using this microSDXC in my cellphone Samsung G4, which is more than enough for pictures, videos, and document downloads. Very fast read and write.",
exactly as described and works GREAT on our Surface Pro's.  Excellent product!  Have never lost any data on one.  TARDIS,
"Have more than one of these MicroSDHC disks and they hold up in my MP3 players, phone, recorder camera etc.",
Using this on my Samsung Galaxy S4.  It works well and has good read/write speeds.  Very pleased with this card.,
"Amazon Tap pretty much works as advertised, and understand that the product will evolve with system updates. Love how the weather, traffic, movies and sports scores/schedules are answered quickly and effortlessly. This was an excellent gift as I gave it to both my son and daughter and my son, unknowingly gave we a Tap back as well. Can't wait to see what improvements are made with the updates coming",
If you are looking for a good SD card look no further. I use this in my Samsung Player and it works great. You can pop it in and out of multiple players if you want to give you flexibility. Also priced very good compared to other places.,
"I have an echo, tap and a dot. Currently my tap serves as a Bluetooth speaker for my dot - making it more like the echo, but i enjoy being able to take the tap anywhere. It has really good sound much like my echo. It also works great in the app and syncs with all my other products.",
I put 20 GB of videos on this micro SD card and  it is a perfect fit and functions flawlessly.,
I've been used this prdoduct on the Past and it has great whit my Past Galaxy Note 2 for Store almost anything on my Device,
l went With the largest Capacity that my Camera Could handled.  Don't skimp on memory .  You really do get what you pay for when it Comes to memory. All memory cards are not created equal.  I trust SanDisk. That's why I'm willing to pay a little bit more.,
Fits in my Samsung Galaxy S3. Migrated all of my music to my phone and no issues. Fast and good performance. Just annoyed I lost so much space after formating it.,
"UPDATE: After 3 months of minimal use the remote stopped working. We have changed the batteries multiple times and still nothing. We can use our phones but that's just a hassle. I am pretty disappointed.Remote works great. It took a little time to pair with the fire stick but it was easy. It was back ordered for weeks, But it did arrive when it said it would.****UPDATE: After 5 months of light use the remote has stopped working. I am pretty disappointed. We have been using the app.",
"Popped this into my Samsung Galaxy S4 right out of the box. No issues whatsoever. Have saved music, movies, photos, etc, with no issue. The adapter works in my computer and printer.",
What can I say? It works and was formatted for an android already. Tho' I'm sure it will work w/ anything!,
Took out my old card a black one from Kingston HC and replaced it with this Ultra one. When transferring files you can see the difference in speed. About 60% faster transfer rate than the Kingston.,
I only had 8 gigs of memory on my Note 2 and was running out of room. Now I have so much memory space available I don't know what to do with it.,
This item arrive on time.  Upon receiving it I put it in an electronic device and it stores stuff you need to store.  Nice colors too.,
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
Works just fine.  Came with an adapter for a standard size card slot.  Installed in a Samsung Mini Tab 2.,
"Does the job. This item is available almost anywhere, but Amazon had it for the lowest price. My girlfriend needed an upgrade for her smartphone and this memory card works quite well. She has tested it by shooting some sample videos and they came out very clear. She said there is plenty of room for apps, games, photos, and of course, videos. I highly recommend this all who need it.",
not sure if it's the card or computer but it only shows up as 32 gig. i tried reformating it and everything and it still says 32gigs.,
"I just don't get what has happened to SanDisk quality.  It seems to have gone down over the years.  This product was glitchy from day one.  I thought it would be fine after a quick check disk, but then it only got worse.  After less than a week I have to return it.  What upsets me is that this is not my first bad experience with SanDisk products.  I used to buy them all the time, they were my brand of choice for flash memory (cards or thumb drives).  The last three products I have bought from them have had problems and failed either immediately or shortly after usage.  So I give up.  I will start looking to other companies for my memory needs.  I bought a Transcend to replace this.  I hope it works out better.",
"bought it for my z10. now i have 6 seasons of tv soaps, over 1000 hi res pics, several short home vids and my entire music library with room to spare",
"As has been the case for years, Amazon sloooowwwwly adds new changes and features to the Kindle. This one is no exception. If you've used a Kindle in the past, you're not going to notice much of a change with this one, but since there are some minor upgrades and so forth, I'll briefly go over them:*** SCREEN ***The new Kindle is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish with the slightly gray/off-white paper looking background. It's certainly not bright white, but it's also not LCD looking (dark gray.) It does NOT have buttons for page-turning as the older generations do. If you simply must have the page-turning buttons, please search for the older Kindles that offer that. One last thing regarding the screen: this is not a Kindle PaperWhite or Voyage where you have a back-lit screen... this has an unlit, off-white Kindle screen. I will say, the text is noticeably crisper and bolder than I've seen with previous generation Kindles and I believe that's because Amazon is using E-Ink's new Carta displays instead of the previously used Pearl displays. I love that and have been waiting for years for E-Ink, the Taiwan based company that makes the Kindle screens for Amazon, to improve them. It looks like they're finally getting it!The new Kindle's screen resolution is 167 ppi which is slightly lower than the Kindle PaperWhite which is 212 ppi, and substantially lower than the Kindle Voyage which boasts an impressive 300 ppi (individual pixels at this density can not be distinguished by the naked eye.) Price-wise though, the base model PaperWhite runs 99 at the time of this review, and the Voyage base model runs 199 so you can see, the more you pay, the better the resolution and features. 167 ppi is fine though...Read more",
cancelled ATT U-verse and bought this w/ netflix and amazon prime. so far we are very happy - especially kids as they have all their favorite shows/movies,
"I have owned literally (and I mean literally) every Kindle since the first one. All the keyboard versions that followed the first one, the Touch, the Paperwhite, the Voyage. All the Fires since the first one, all the different sizes from 10 to 6 and every gen in between. (I know, I am a little crazy.) Many of these are still in use among family members and my habit was to switch between Fires depending on mood. My last attempt was an iPad Mini, used only as an eReader, and for the first time in many years I bought books from somewhere other than Amazon, because I found the iBooks experience so pleasant. Bottom line... I was always seeking a Kindle that fit all my needs as a book and nothing more. Stop the press. I have found it.Lets put a little context around this. I eventually migrated to the Fires because although I liked the eInk for reading, I also liked to see more detail on book covers and black and white didn't seem to offer that. The Paperwhite and it's successors got closer, so that even without color the detail was sufficient to make browsing by cover satisfactory (something I have always done, even with real books).Still though, what I didn't like about the eInk versions was the inability to render a page without big gaps between words or even truncated lines when there was a big or hyphenated word in the line. I don't know whether it is just coincidence that I haven't seen that yet with the Oasis, or whether the Amazon Ember font helps (I like this new font a lot) or whether it has been specifically addressed in the newer OS. Whatever, I have not seen that yet and it removes one of my reasons for preferring a tablet over an eReader.First impressions... not great.Read more",
I put it in my tablet and so far nothing to complain about. Will see how long this one can last.,
"exactly what I neededTook the old 32 GB card out of my Samsung Galaxy S4 to put in my digital recorder so I bought this new 64 GB card for the phone.As advertised, very fast and stable (I try to transfer as many of my apps to external media on the phone to free memory on the phone) and I have not had one problem as of yet.Highly recommended",
Got this on sale! What a deal!,
"This is a really small card, but it holds the data and does the job.  It comes with an adapter allowing the card to be used in a laptop or card reader.  It has worked well for me so far and has my recommendation.",
"I bought this memory card for my galaxy note 2 phone. I saved a lot of money by purchasing the 16gb phone and just buying this memory card. I haven't came close to filling it up yet, but when i do, i'll just upgrade to the 64gb version of this card. great product! fast shipping! great price!",
SanDisk makes no nonsense great memory. Works perfectly on my S4 and couldn't be happier. I recommend this for sure.,
"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more",
So i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job. A guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome! I loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such. Its portable its got clean and crisp sound. It also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected. Its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all,
Yes!,
I would recommend this card to everyone.Data Transfer speeds - excellent with this card on my Galaxy S2.  Didn't need to format the card or anything. I am 100% satisfied.,
"I use this in my Hero3 white edition camera for FPV.  I've done about 20 videos to date, without a single problem.",
"Purchase for HP tablet to have more memory for music download, pictures, and video.  Have enough room to store and some memory left over.",
"A nice complement to the Alexa family. The sound quality is nearly as good as the original Echo, and the voice activation addition makes it an even better by, particularly for the price.",
Slow compared to some usb drives. The good is it is small and will hold large files. I would recommend this product for cell phone only use. Not to be used as a back up usb memory drive for Nexus 7. I would use a high speed USB drive for the Nexus 7.,
Bought this Micro Memory Card for my smart phone so I could take long videos on phone it working ok,
"64GB... I'm set for I don't know how long. I bought one for my Note 8 and my S3. I've loaded tons of pics and music and still have more than enough space to last me for a long, long, long time.Thank you Samsung for having your new devices able to read 64GB microSD cards.",
"This is a little gray square, with one corner missing.  It holds just short of 32gb of data, and transfers it at just short of 30MB/s, as expected.  I use in in my cameras, which is what it's designed for, and it works as designed.",
"Gets the job done for my GoPro so that's good. I just never liked how small the actual card is due to its nature of it might just get lost...then that's game over. The price was amazing, so I got two for the price of half of one.",
"I bought three of these cards. One died one day (in my Galaxy S3) after about a month and a half of use. The phone said the card was removed unexpectedly, and it never functioned again. The phone still recognized all other cards. I contacted SanDisk, and they shipped out a replacement under warranty.The cards have served me well. Two are in Galaxy S3's, and another in a Galaxy Note II. Copying to them is decently fast, and they are great for music or video storage. Phones have no problem playing 720p video off the cards.",
"I purchased this MicroSD card to record extended 1080p videos and it has worked flawlessly. Camera did not immediately recognize the card, but going into the settings and selecting format solved the problem.",
"awesome product. it was worth if of buying. it's cheap and have a lot of memory, not to mention the fast processing.",
Bought it for a couple of my friends and it was a big hit with them! Very useful!,
I simply slide the card into it's slot and suddenly have 50GB more space.  I wish the OS didn't consume so much of the 64GB you start out with though.,
"SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card one of the best memory card I bought, how quickly and read the data back is amazing",
Phone recognized immediately and it is as fast as they claim.Picture taking used to be painfully slow. It is as fast as I am taking pictures.I put it in my Galaxy Note II.,
"The reason this is the 2nd best purchase, is because my Kindle Fire HD is 1st... This has been a great purchase and has so many options available when connected with Amazon Prime. I have never been a big TV Watcher in the last few years, but I am back to it a bit with this device coupled with Amazon Prime. I watch Movies and TV Shows with my wife and it is great. If you spend much time in front of the TV, then I would say this is a must have and I love it almost as much as my Kindle Fire HD..",
I have a lot of music and pictures and keeping them on the card frees up storage for apps that cannot use the card.  Money well spent.,
"I got this for my Galaxy S4 so I could store most of my music. It works great. Easy to install (duh), worked out of the box (good), and transfer speeds seem to be very fast. I need to get another one for my Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition.",
Good price. Fast and useful to expand more storage for the newly bought Asus tablet. Build quality looks great. It conveniently came with two adaptors so it can be fit to other computers when copying files.,
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
"The case is cute and a nice color, fabric is nice, seems it will hold up. Problem is it doesn't stand up as described, mine doesn't stand up at all. Priced is too high for what it is in my opinion. I wouldn't buy this case again",
"It's a memory card, stores memory well, no problems after 2 months of use in my Note 2. Great price online.",
"I received this on Friday, followed the review from another person about formatting the disk before using it, and after the format, it did it's thing!  I have a Motorola Droid RAZR and have seen a huge improvement.  The phone is much faster.  The apps open and close much faster.  That also goes for the camera.  I highly recommend this and worth the price.  I haven't placed any music on the it yet except for pictures on my phone.  Cheers.",
This is the echo you can take anywhere. Runs on battery and can connect via bluetooth when away from wifi.,
I shopped several other places for a good deal on a quality memory card and found it at amazon once again,

I bought this for my new Gopro3 black. It works wonderfully! I totally recommend it if you're looking for some high quality and speed,
"Always can trust SanDisk for my memory card needs.  This purchase was because I was considering getting a Samsung Galaxy S3 phone, which only has 16gb memory, but has an internal slot for memory expansion.  However, just had several bad experiences with 3 Samsung Printers at work ~ all of them broke down within a couple of weeks of each other for various reasons, and to get repair and replacement parts is ridiculously expensive.... cheaper for me to go and buy a new printer!  Samsung website is 1500% useless, and tech support is even less knowledgeable than my 4 year old nephew!  Spoke to a good friend who works for AT&T;, who has both S3 and iPhone 5.... and he said, DONT GET THE S3.... so I upgraded to an 64GB iPhone 5.So this memory card has gone to my son for his Galaxy S3.So sorry about the rant, but I hate Samsung.....",

"I bought this card as a music expansion for my Samsung S4 and it handles that task deftly.  I don't know how it would work in an intense need of speed environment, but it's perfect for my purposes.",
Good looking and works well. If you're having trouble standing it up vertically or horizontally check out Amazon's video (link below). My only slight quibble is that I find the Fire 7 slippery (it's fallen out of my hand) and I was hoping this case might have more of a grippy material.,
Works great in our Nikon D600.  We'll NEVER run out of space between downloads :-),

Hard to review this. It's an amazing little chip with huge capacity and it does what it's supposed to do. 5 stars.,

"Works well with the tablet and htc phone, it doesn't need to do formatting. The devices recognized immediately with no problem. Recommended!",
"First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory. It would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage, go buy a computer.Display: One word, amazing. Maybe I am pushing it, but the screen is so clear. I own an iPhone 5 and my eyes prefer my kindle. I love reading on this machine and for the price, amazon did a good job with this one.Read more",
"Seemed to work well at first.  Then, I noticed the phone started mounting/unmounting the card. When I tried to update some music files on the card, I think it has failed.  My computer can no longer see it in the phone when the two are connected.Okay - an update here. Since I posted the problem on Amazon I was contacted by Sandisk. I made one phone call, they took my information, e-mailed me a pre-paid UPS label, and I sent the card in. I couldn't believe it, but I think I had a new and improved card in about three days!  Yes, the first one lasted a little over twelve months, but the replacement was tendered no questions asked. Great service that can only be five stars.By the way, the replacement is working great!  I ordered a 64gb Sandisk microSDHC Card as well!",

If the replacement goes bad, I'll be back to complain:)SECOND UPDATE: All is well with the replacement so I'm giving it three stars.",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:br /br /Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, 34listening through a can34 sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).br /br /Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"This is the latest version of the microSD cards Class 10. I purchased it for Asus MemoPad HD 7 tablet which I use mostly to play movies for my son. Since all of our movies are in HD I wanted to ensure I have a fast storage card so movies can play smoothly.This is also very important when taking pictures or videos. The faster the SD card is, the faster the device will process and store the picture and release the camera for the next picture.. with Android 4.2 JellyBean, Google introduced burst picture taking which allow you to long press the shutter and the camera will take several pictures in a row. This is great if you are trying to shoot something in motion. A fast SD card is essential for this feature to work properly.",
"Great value. Fast shipping. Brand you can trust.My previous card by &#34;another manufacturer&#34; died after only 3 months of use, along with everything on it.For 64 GB, this card is a beast of a value. I've dropped my phone hard several times and had no data lost from this card. It's fantastic.My primary use is recording 1080p video and high rez pictures to the device, as well as audio recordings. I use this for media.  It's fast transfer speed allows it to keep up with all my demands. Only time will tell how truly reliable/durable it turns out to be. I'm going on 2 months now as of January 2014. Any adversities I have along the way, I will post here in updates.Smashing good value of a card!TIP: When you first get your card, be sure to use your phone (or other device you'll be using it in) to format it. This is standard practice with all card based memory, and will prevent you from encountering errors or oddities with your device.",
I am using this in my Samsung galaxy smart phone and I did not find any issue. easy to access,
"Disk works as expected, we rarely fill it up before purging contents.",
It work great in my Asus Tablet for 3 months then it just completely died. It was not recognized by any of my devices. It had just died.I have RMA'd it to Sandisk. The prcess was painless and my replacement should arrive within a few days. They emailed me a return label thru UPS and sent it off last week.When it worked the performance was great and access times were very fast. No lag in reading and writing data.If you get this just make sure you have a back up of your data incase of failure. Had my Tablet synced to my cloud service so I did not lose anything. I have purchased other Sandisk items and have never had a issue.,
No issues.,
"It's so fantastic to just ask a device to turn on lights, or play music. So convenient. Love this!",
"After 15 months, my 500+ tablet is no longer useable. It is stuck on the boot screen. I invested a lot of into Amazon movies and books. This stinks.",
This is a great product I would highly recommend getting it,
I've had this card for about a year and I've been very careful with it and it just broke when I popped it out of sd card slot on my phone but it was very reliable card when it wasn't broken,
There are things that I would like to say about the sand disk ultra.It is the best dang SD card I've ever used.  All rights so let's be honest I just put this in my phone so that I would have extra storage for photos and videosHowever it is really good because it just sits in my phone and I don't have to do anything about it.Seriously I can access everything by Just connecting my phone to USB so it is essentially like the phone has another hard drive.,
"I was looking for the maximum storage I could add to my SD card slot on my Samsung Galaxy S4. While Samsung only recommends using standard MicroSD cards, this MicroSDXC card works perfectly and offers great speeds. If you need a card to expand your Galaxy S4's storage, this is the go-to card for you.",
"I bought this to add storage to my 16GB GS4, which only ended up having around 10GB on arrival. The transfer speeds are great, I was able to copy my entire music library over in minutes!",
Mostly just use it for the speaker. Still waiting on the no touch feature they are adding.,
I connected one end of the hdm1 cable into hdm1 port so on. turned on tv. no screen guide for set up,
"We were going on vacation and I wanted to take a bunch of digital media for the long plane flights and for chilling during downtime. This chip took everything I needed and worked without issue. Glad to see the 128GB chips on the market, looking forward to the 256GB ones!",
"Super fast and lots of storage! I can fit months worth of Music, App's and eBook's on it with room to go!",
"Purchased for my android phone to provide more media storage.  The one I received was DOA.  Spoke with SanDisk tech support who confirmed that it was a bad unit.  Since it was within 30 days, they suggested I return it to Amazon instead of going through warranty procedures.  I returned it to Amazon, but made the mistake of requesting a replacement instead of a refund.  The replacement appeared to work at first, but after a short while, it caused my phone to reboot, files went missing and displayed other forms of instability.  It was a bit late to return again, so I contacted Sandisk who replaced the unit under the warranty.  However, this all took a lot of time, necessitated repeated copying of many GBs of data and secure erasing of information.The warranty replacement from SanDisk works well, so far.  However, I'm not seeing much improvement in my application over a similar 32GB Class 4 SanDisk microSDHC (this one is class 10).  Would probably give the current unit 3 stars, but this rating is for the Amazon delivered units (both defective).If you do get a bad one, I'd suggest to return for refund, not replacement.",
"Very fast read and write, works great right out of the box.  Would buy again if I need another one.",
I brought this as a gift for a family member and was a hit at their party. Thank you bunches.,
"Bought 1 to expand capacity on a Galaxy S3, and another to expand capacity on a Galaxy S4. Have used the one for the GS3 for about a year, and the one for the GS4 about a month. Both have worked without any problems, and are fully recognized by the devices. The GS3 was rooted a couple of months ago and is running LiquidSmooth. Still no issues. Very good card. I highly recommend SanDisk.",
"I bought this with the sole intention of putting it in my Samsung Galaxy S3. I had to use a tool to format the card to FAT32, but once I did so, the card worked great. I have been taking advantage of the extra room I have for music, videos, pictures, etc. The SD adapter that comes with this is also handy.The transfer speeds didn't feel like class 10 when connected and transferred files from my computer, but my computer is 5 years old, so it's very possible that it's the problem. Other than that, I'm completely satisfied.",
"I bought this for my wife's tablet computer.  It has worked perfectly so for and I have no reason to believe it won't continue that way. SanDisk makes very good products.  I've used their products for many years and nothing has ever failed - high performance, fair pricing and great reliability.",
"A new camcorder required fast SD (micro) and SanDisk products have always provided first class service, so the extra cost is well worth it.",
I just popped this in mySamsung Galaxy S III/S3 GT-I9300 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version (Pebble Blue)and it works great!  I did not have to format or it or anything.,
"Besides blowing my mind that 32GB of data can fit on a chip this small (and also, magnets...how do they work??), there is nothing particularly special about this product. It works as intended, and it's cheap. SanDisk and Kingston are my go-to's for all things data-storage.",
"This new KFHD replaces last year's basic Kindle Fire. Although it has some cool new features, it lacks a camera, microphone, and HDMI port. For this reason, I'm glad I kept my 2012 model since it does have these 3 features! Here are my initial impressions of the 2013 Kindle Fire HD: I like the placement of the on/off volume buttons. Being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one. I never cared for the carousel (this is what you see when you turn your Kindle on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed), and now there's an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead, and the apps/books can be rearranged to your liking. I was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar (which is now being called home). I don't know why Amazon removed this option, and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel. But you can still bookmark your favorite web pages YouTube videos for easy access. When I play songs purchased from Amazon's MP 3 store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style. Nice feature, but it doesn't work on every song. This device has a cool new feature called Quick Switch, which allows us, when reading or using an app, to bring up recently accessed items with a swipe instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one.In terms of sound, I find it to be tinny and not as rich as it is on the original KFHD. But you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds. Ironically, music sounds muffled unless you hold the device in landscape mode with your hands covering the speakers. Holding it this way projects the sound out to you.Read more",
"So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.Thanks for letting me rant",
"I'm totally enjoying my Echo Dot! I have it synced to my Google Calendar and am able to let Alexa tell me what's on the agenda for the day. I can quickly ask her to set a timer or an alarm and easily find out about the local weather. I also have it synced to my Pandora account but you have to be specific about a saved station name when you want to listen to Pandora. I really wish I could just say shuffle my Pandora stations. That would be awesome! The speaker on the Dot isn't as loud as I would like it but if I'm sitting close by, it's good enough I guess. I've seen an option to add an external speaker but I haven't gotten around to doing that yet. And my 6 yo grandson loves to ask her to tell him a joke! I live in a small town and am probably not able to utilize the full potential of Alexa but I'm not regretting my purchase.",
"When researching reviews for best memory for the GoPro we read that some people had issues with this card, but possibly could have been the 'mobile' version, which was not a true class 10 card.  So far, no issues with this card, recording, uploading, etc...",
"With that said, there has been some skepticism related to the serial number of the card as it is displayed on Amazon. I can confirm that I received a brand new 64 Gb card with the serial SDSDQUA-064G-U46A.",
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
"I am very happy with this SanDisk, if anyone is looking for a goodly amount of storage, get this one.",
"I have a dashcam.  It didn't come with a memory card so I got this.This card has been working well in a fairly demanding capacity.  That's because like the way most drivers use dashcams, I've got mine set to 10 minute loops.  That means new data is being written over and over again on this card.  So far the card hasn't quit on me and I'm pleased.",
"great price and great manufacture.  the item met my needs for my new phone, I'll have ample storage now using this device.",
"I've had other Sandisk memory cards, and they've always proven reliable. As always with memory, get the biggest you can afford, because you'll always need more than you think, and volume gets more economical with greater capacity.",
"Card is recognized as 59.5GB as expected.  I'm able to carry around all of my music without having to carry an iPod as well, now.  It came with a plastic case with an SD card adapter.",
Added this card to my Note 2 for massive storage capacity. Phone recognized the card without any issues and it's been solid since its installation. Read/write when plugged into a computer is blazing fast.,
I bought it for my galaxy tab 10.1 and formatted it to FAT32.  Works excellent and i have more than enough space for what ever i need on my tablet.  going to buy another one for my Handy cam!,
Seems to work just fine. I have loaded it up about 1/3 full and deleted the files and nothing unexpected has happened.,
Very  impressed  with the speed of this 32 GB Micro SDHC. Very good performance for Data Read and Write .,
16GB and it works!,
We are HUGE fans of the Amazon Fire Stick and my son realllly wants to play the games with the remote. A little pricey in my opinion. Works great though and I know I can return if it breaks!,
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
What else can i say holds a lot of my stuff! Fits perfectly in my phone add no weight. Buy it!,
"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysOctober 11, 2013Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound, and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD. As you correctly point out, the new Kindle Fire HD is the successor to last year's entry level Kindle Fire, which does not include features such as camera, microphone, or HDMI port. You are also correct to point out that this device does not support Mayday, although there are still multiple ways to get help for free directly from your device. We hope you enjoy the new features and services. Thanks, The Kindle Team",
"This review is to try to offset some of Roku employees that are on here trying to knock this device.The first thing you notice after plugging everything in, is a 3-5 minute demo that you can unfortunately not bypass, even if you know your way around these types of devices. You will only see it once, and then you're good to go. The device is small and beautiful. The remote is better than any other device, including Roku 3, and my WD TV Live.First the PROs:- It's the fastest media streamer, by far. That's not only a good thing if you own one, but it will force Roku and other companies to stop skimping on the hardware, and firmware updating.- The menu is intuitive and easy to maneuver. You can't move things around yet, but I'm sure they will eventually let you customize your own page. As of now, the apps (which would be at the top, if I could change it) are at the bottom. Apps are larger and higher resolution than the Roku.- The voice button is amazing. For a first attempt, they almost got it right. I understand this is a proprietary device, so they will always want you to use Amazon instant video for your viewing. But this option should search for all of your linked accounts, including Hulu, Netflix, etc. I'm not sure that they will ever fix this, because they will lose money and viewers. Even so, it's still a PRO, because it does work well.- Streaming quality - WOW Everything I've tried buffers so quickly, that it's almost already at 1080p when it starts playing. With my Roku, Netflix looks great, but it takes 5-10 seconds to get there. I currently have 100Mbps of internet, so I'm not sure what everyone else goes through, but I can tell you this streams better than Roku. Period.- Overheating and reboots - My Roku 3 cannot handle more than a couple of hours of viewing before it decides that was too many rows of stairs. It gets exhausted, and it has to reset itself. This device is more powerful, and after using it all day today, I can say my Roku 3 will be immediately up for sale, once they add the Time Warner Cable and HBOgo apps.-- PLEX -- Okay, I always blamed my Plex for the long delays on my Roku. With my internet speeds, I could never understand why it was always loading at 1080p settings, regardless of the bitrate. Anyway, I was wrong. It's the device. Not only does the Fire TV have a much better PLEX app (which is beautiful, btw), but everything streams at maximum quality within seconds. No re-loading (buffering) during movie playback. And the movies are in a much nicer grid layout, so I don't have to sift through one row to get to a movie selection.Now the CONS:- Obviously it's still missing some apps. You are crazy if you think HBOgo will go much longer without being added. The same for other apps. They built it, so they WILL come.- Interface - it is nice, but as I stated in the PROs, you can't make changes to it, hopefully just for now. If it stays this way, it will be a little annoying to have to scroll down all the way just to get to my apps.- One major issue that is very upsetting to me, is the fact that they couldn't add two very important things - USB 3.0, and 802.11ac. If Amazon claims they were listening, they would also know that these two things would dramatically improve the user experience. I haven't plugged my WD 4TB hard to it yet, but it is a 3.0 hard drive. Now it will unfortunately revert to 2.0 speeds. Don't build a supposedly forward-thinking device with two things that are now considered dated. I have a feeling this was done to make money off the Fire TV 2. Thanks for that.Overall, it is the best device currently available, and they really made the experience fun. It does make you want to call your cable company and cancel service. Buy it...you will not regret it.",
My son requested this a a birthday gift. He is enjoying it everyday.,
"So far so good. I've never noticed a difference in memory cards, I'm just very glad to have extra memory!",
"I routinely use SDXC cards up to 128GB, and this card was unreadable on arrival.  Both of my PCs said it needed to be formatted, and as a last resort I let one of them try (Windows 7/i7with up-to-date SDXC drivers), and it could not format it.  It's on its way back to Amazon.  I'm glad their returns are so easy!",
"The speed is great i use it in my Galaxy Tab 3 and had a bunch of HD movies on it and i can watch movies on my tablet flawlessly, does what it says",
"This is the fifth e-ink Kindle reader that I've bought. My wife and I were early adopters of Kindle, and when we buy a new Kindle, the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line. I loved the original Paperwhite, with its small size, touch screen, front-lighting, and virtual keyboard. The all-new Paperwhite is a definite step up, and for me, it was worth the move, but others will have to decide for themselves. If you read a lot, and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink Kindles, it's definitely worth upgrading to the Paperwhite. If you have the original Paperwhite, the upgrade is well worth considering. Although I've only had the new Paperwhite a few hours, I'm already glad I upgraded. Here's a summary of my initial impressions of the new Paperwhite.SIZE: It's the same size as the original Paperwhite - 6.7x4.6x0.36. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.8 ounces to 7.3 ounces. The Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand, which is how I usually read. The really good news is that if you have a case for the original Paperwhite, it will also fit the new one (thank you, Amazon). If you buy a case, I highly recommend that the case include the magnetic AutoWake function. It's much easier to turn the Kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch.LIGHTING: The front-lighting is noticeably improved over the original Paperwhite, which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the LED lights were located. (It didn't bother me, but some readers were annoyed by that.) I couldn't see any shadows in the new Paperwhite, where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform. With the Paperwhite's front lighting, you'll never need a clip-on light, even in total darkness.Read more",
This card works very well with my dashcam so far and I have no reason to expect it won't continue to do so.,
"Has anyone ever had a DOA? The only chips I have ever lost were after some use, but SanDisk is a good brand",
"i got this for my GoPro hero3 and so far its working great. The GoPro's really eat up the flash memory so I bought 3 of the 32 GB models. i suggest that unless you are going on a particularly long scuba dive or adventure, you should get the 32 GB over the 64 GB cards as it spreads out the risk of any one card failure causing loss of all your videos.",
We bought this to go with our new Samsung Galaxy Tab 4. Works great and allows us to add a lot of videos onto our tablet.,
"Seems like a good value, but as yet i've not gotten to actually use mine;I bought it for a Contour+ camera without realizing that was apparently known to be incompatible. Found that out afterward on Contour's forum. The device itself will support microSD up to 64GB but there is something about Sandisk Ultras that doesn't play nicely. Unclear what, exactlySo I'm sure it's great, but you might want to check around to make sure your device will support the thing.",
"Purchased this for the GoPro Hero 3.I use the GoPro to record in-car footage at the track. this memory card fits a whole weekend event, which is about four hours of footage at 720p.",
I bought this for my GoPro Hero 3 Silver Edition. Works like a champ. Havnt had any issues. Definitly would purchase again.,
"The samsung  S4 is only 16G not enough so I bough this 32G plug to have more storage , so far I have no problem, music, video, copy/delete file do all kind of thing still good.",
This card worked well with my last two smart phones and holds all my favorite music with enough extra storage for photos.,
"Perfect for using in my Galaxy S3.  Seems to read and write quickly, and it's never given me any trouble.  Shipping was fast.  Very happy with this product.",
This is such a great product I have two of them! Would highly recommend.,
SanDisk makes a great big little card. I have this in my HTC sensation 4G ( which it isn't supposed to work in ) and I got the full memory card working. It's great to be able to cary that mush memory on a phone.,
"It's pretty good for what it is designed to do: a portable bluetooth speaker and Alexa-enabled speaker. Not voice controlled so you have to touch the speaker button for Alexa. Nice thing once connected to your Alexa account is that you can play music, whatever, without having your phone nearby though Alexa only works when connected to WiFi. If no Wifi, then connect via bluetooth to play music from any apps. Battery life is also pretty good.",
Got this for a Galaxy S4 and it worked flawlessly.  Typical SDHC installation with no issues that increased S4 storage capacity.,
"After purchasing three of these (one for myself and two for gifts to others) I read reviews that said they sometimes just quit, and it's difficult or impossible to recover data.  I have only been using my own card for 2-3 weeks, but it hasn't failed yet.3/27/13 after having this in my phone for almost 4 months, the phone started chirping every few seconds, telling me it was either mounting or unmounting a card.  The SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card apparently just decided to fail.  Thank goodness I only had info for one small app on it, and only need to access it about once a week, so it's not real critical.  Thanks to Amazon's 30 day return policy though, I will probably just have to eat the cost of this one.  Unfortunately, I read the other bad reviews about this product after I had already purchased mine (2 of them, but my wife's hasn't failed YET).  My advice is to stay clear of this product, and maybe SanDisk in general.",
The micro disk fit my Samsung phone perfectly by itself and I was able to use the adapter to fit it to my HP computer to transfer my tunes to my phone. Great product and price. I especially like the &#34;green&#34; packaging. So much easier to access the product and no wasteful plastic. Highly recommend it.,
Bought the Astak CM-7200...This memory card works great in that with no hesitation for the video..Great pice too..No problems. Thumbs up!!,
"Had had this for about 6 months now and it's in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Haven't had any storage issues and it was a breeze to put in the phone.  I went with SanDisk because of their reputation and reliability.  Sure... I could have gone a little cheaper in price, but it wasn't all that expensive to start with, so why not spend a little extra and get something that will last.",
We got this for my son for xmas. He loves it. He uses it daily.,
The 32 gig San Disk memory card went into a tablet given as a Christmas gift.No problems and fast performance.I loaded all the music and some video that was stored in a laptop.I still have 12 gigs left.Very happy with the memory unit.,
I liked this so much that I bought a 2nd here.  The first I put in my Samsung Galaxy Player 5 and the second in my Samsung Galaxy S 4G phone.  The card easily hold all my mp3s and apps.  This card is noticeably faster than the cheaper cards that have a speed of 4 on them...this card is a 10 and when you first boot your device you see all your apps get loaded within seconds.  If you want a good 32 GB mini SD card then this is the one!,
It does the job but is super over priced. I feel like they should offer a replacement remote at a better price. I could have just spent 10 more and gotten the stick. I just think it's ridiculous to spend 32 on a remote. The product is fine. I'm just unhappy with the price.,
Had it installed on my cell phone for about 6 months now and it works flawlessly. very pleased with this product.,
"I bought this case at the same time I bought a new Fire tablet during Prime days. It was recommended on the tablet page, so I thought I was getting the right case. Well, it doesn't fit - not by a long shot. Then I realized the case was for a new Fire for 2017 (like mine) but 7th generation, not 8th. Since it does not fit, I now have to return it. And at my expense (arg!) I can't even exchange it for a new one because apparently Amazon does not make this case for the 8th generation Fire yet. You update one of your products, then release it, but you don't put out a case for it at the same time WTH Amazon When will you start selling Amazon cases for the Amazon Fire 8th generation I'm NOT happy with Amazon right now and am wondering whether I should keep the tablet if I can't get a case for it that has the vertical stand feature that the Amazon case has.",
"I connected it to my galaxy S4, but every now and then (once or twice a week) it will eject from my phone and the phone will need to re read the card. It's not a big issue, but when it happens you may need to wait like 4 min for your files.It happens a lot less now that i dont use the powersaving funtion. Something about the powersaving on the phone seems to not deliver enough power to the card.",
"This is the card that solved the problem with three dash cams that would not operate properly, the problem was the cheap wrong type SD Card, use this card and it works!!!",
"Out of the box mine updated and setup fine. - No ProblemsMy biggest complaint is that Voice Search only searches Amazon and a very few things from HuluPlus... Should search ALL content from at least the Big 3 (Netflix, AmazonPrime HuluPlus)Had some picture glitches on HuluPlus Netflix. I switched over to my Roku3 on the same content and worked just fine...I didn't like the Menus... Not as easy as Roku...Netflix looks and works WAY BETTER on Roku3...I think this might become a player in the market that Roku owns... Maybe... But has too many problems for me to bet on that at full price... I might buy one later when they go on sale and the software's been tweaked... Along with more channels added...Considering you can buy a Roku 3 for the same money or less, with a HUGE list of public private channels, also search that really works... The Fire TV is, at this point, a very bad choice... Don't pay them list price to be a Fire TV Beta Tester...",
"32 gig MicroSD card that costs less than a dollar per gig and is Class 10! And even more importantly, it tests at class 10 and operates at class 10, which is saying a lot compared to a lot of other &#34;Class 10&#34; cards.",
The read and write speeds are better than the Samsung SD card that I had previously. I would not hesitate to buy another one of these great Micro SD cards from SanDisk. I also own their Clip plus MP3 player and it works very well. I think I'm becoming a fan of the SanDisk products.,
"Same features as Echo now, but easier to move around the house as needed w/you.",
"WAS SURPRISED HOW GREAT THIS WORKS , MUSIC ASK IT QUESTIONS AWESOME",
It simply works even after 3.5 years of constant use. The battery is OK. Display looks the same. System is stable and reasonably responsive.,
"I have been using the device for couple weeks, so far no issue.The writing speed is slow, which might be the problem on my laptop not the card.",
"Excellent secondary storage device! I have one installed in my mobile phone, and one in my tablet. They have greatly enhanced my multimedia options. My phone has over 4000 songs on it with room for more. My tablet has about 42 full-length good quality movies loaded.",
"Purchased this as a gift for a teenage kid as a graduation present. Very pleased with the purchase. The kids love it. Small size, but good speakers. Perfect for the college dorms where he is scheduled to go in a couple of months. Love how the device connects to the cloud and keeps itself updated.",
"Being an amazon prime member for a few years now, I was hoping they would come up with a product like this. Simple to set up. Easy to use.",
There's not much to be said for this except that it works as advertised.  I'm happy with the purchase and would buy again.,
Serves my needs as required. Sound is good. Ability to move device where required is ideal,
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
Install on Samsung phone and it works great.  Recommend if you need more memory on the phone and install with no problems,
"Works well in my Galaxy Note II.  I've bought many Sandisk memory cards and never experienced a failure, even the 256MB SD card purchased for a Palm Pilot still works.",
"I bought the 64GB version for my Samsung Galaxy Note II and it works great.  Didn't need to format or anything.  Opened the box, popped it into my phone and it worked just as expected.  Transfer speeds via usb connected to the phone and direct via card reader are both fast.I also bought the 32GB version to use (with included SD adapter) in my Canon SD4500IS.  Again, just popped it directly into my device and it was ready to go.  Very happy with both products.  I've used many Sandisk flash cards in the past without issue so I expect these will hold up extremely well over time as well.  It might be a few more bucks than some lesser known brands, but I feel its worth the premium.",
This is larger than I need but on a long vacation I did not want to start deleting photos or videos to make room for others so this was way more than I needed for several hundred large photos and lots of 20 to 30 second videos as well with  lots of memory left over. Actually a  8gb would have been  enough. The card worked well and I'm happy with my purchase.,
"Having a 32gb mirosd is great! I use it in my phone and hardly have to upload my pics and what not. My phone works faster with all the extra space and I never have to worry about needing to delete any songs,pics,or apps.",
"Use it in my Ainol Spark, and it gets great read/write speeds.  Dont ever use your available past 90% or you will corrupt your SD cards in a very short time.  So available is 29 gig, and dont go over say.. 26 and you will likely never get a problem with it.",
"Great value, plenty of storage for both my phone & tablet!  I looked around and this is a really good deal.",
Not much to say about this except it works great.  The R/W speed never seems to slow down photo or movie taking.  32 GB doubled the capacity of my tablet so I won't reach the capacity for a long time.,
This product works as advertised.  The 64 GB card allows you to store Video and stills without having to change cards between uses.  I love it.,
I love the Amazon Tap. The sound is great and it's completely portable. It lacks the convenience of touch free voice command but it cost less to compensate. Excellent product for the money!,
"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more",
Great product. Can always count on sandisk. Just make sure your device can support 64gb card. Don't go cheap and fall for counterfeits.,
Fast and reliable. Have worked with it for around 2 months now and nothing to complain about.Good fit for my Asus TF700,
this card is use in a galaxy S4; read and write speed is very good. the card comes ready to use out of the box,
no problems at all. works great,
I have the have the Echo and this portable speaker is a great addition to my automated home. Especially if I'm working in the garage and want to listen to music,
"My pour Note 2 has been working absolutely overtime.  I just love it so much.  So I am downloading a great many pictures, audible books, and of mp3's from Amazon.  With all of these many interest of mine working over time I soon found that the 32 GB microcard was just too small.  So when Amazon had a great sale on the 64 GB ones I purchased it.  My main concerns was would it work in my phone and be fast enough to do so seamlessly.  Well that it was this 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 did.  So whatever SanDisk wants to name it, the bottom line is that it works seamlessly and now I don't get those nasty warnings telling me my memory was almost full.  It is very nice that Samsung realized the need to be able to use such larger memory cards, and the Note 2 allows this size card use without any issues at all.",
Purchased for school district.  I haven't heard any complaints (which I would) so I can only assume that everything is okay.,
I bought one for my GoPro last year and ended up putting it in my tablet last week. Ordered another one for the GoPro. After the trip next week it will go in my phone. Guess I'll need another one for the next trip.,
"The memory card worked perfectly, and was compatible with Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, and was a great price for a name brand memory.",
This card is extremely fast. In order to leverage its full capability your card reader and device must support UHS-I. However it is also very fast with class 10 devices.,
"There really isn't much anyone can say that's bad about SD, they are the best around...SC Cards are the best you can get",
Card works well. Runs quickly in my wife's Galaxy SII. She would buy it again and I bought one later for my tab 2 7.,
works as expected. great Christmas present for the kids.,
"works perfect with no issues on my phone Samsung Galaxy S 3, and Galaxy Note 10.1. . . . .",
"LOVE OUR NEW ECHO! I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them echolettes LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request.Read more",
"I always buy San Disk as I had issues with other brands and it always works in every application I used it, phone, camera, tablet, etc.",
"Ok i've been in the technology field for close to 20 years and a gamer since the 80's so i know a little something about controllers. This really is an awesome controller with a great feel to it. It doesnt feel cheap in any way, and works perfect. It also has voice search button which works great and it has volume control via the shoulder buttons when headphones are plugged in. Ive read a few reviews about bad battery life and i havent found it an issue on mine. I bought it in late december and the batteries are due to be changed now in late april. I would like to see rechargable batteries built it instead but maybe in the future.",
"Absolutely a perfect MicroSD Chip.4500 songs were transferred into it, effortlessly and I have  balance of about 50% of usable space.SanDisk is a synonym with all Engineers and I need not add any thing to glorify it.Thank you SanDisk thank you AMAZON.SincerelyKJ Kumar",
"When the price is right on these these memory cards, why not buy for it a late model tablet?  I could  also  make this a review for Class 4 Kingston 32 GB MicroSDHC, which I bought from Amazon at the same time.  The Class 10 cards will work in the late model tablets.  While there might be a small speed boost in booting up and having the tablet ready to run compared to a Class 6 or a lower class card.  I would say it there just isn't that huge of difference between this and lower speed cards.  I would say it's what inside the tablet that will determine it's boot-up speed more than the card you put into it.  In different devices such as cameras that can use this type of card this may very well --not-- be true.  But brand name and cost are the determining factors for what I buy to put in my tablets.",
"I bought this for an Atrix HD. The specs say maximum 32Gb, but 64 works fine with a formatted capacity of around 58GB.I did a speed benchmark here (I don't know if Amazon strips links)[...]",
I use this for my phone and it works just as it should and it was totally worth the money! Great place to store pictures and music for phones instead of using the phone memory so it will still run fast.,
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",

"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysOctober 11, 2013Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound, and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD. As you correctly point out, the new Kindle Fire HD is the successor to last year's entry level Kindle Fire, which does not include features such as camera, microphone, or HDMI port. You are also correct to point out that this device does not support Mayday, although there are still multiple ways to get help for free directly from your device. We hope you enjoy the new features and services. Thanks, The Kindle Team",
"I had purchased a cheaper cellphone, and the great price on this item made it the perfect accessory/alternative to buying a much more expensive phone.Class 10 speed means that I don't have to worry about any lag in accessing my files.  I have had no issues what so ever with having to format the card.  It worked perfectly with my phone (Samsung Axiom) right out of the box.",
Worked once I was able to find a system to format it.Second card from SanDisk that was sent to me unformatted.They need to get their act together...,
"The Amazon Tap is a great mobile Bluetooth speakers, if you are invested in the Amazon eco-system. The produces good sound at all levels, plays music stored in your associated cloud accounts and does everything else the Echo can do, just with mobility added to it (as opposed to the Echo that always has to be plugged into the wall to work).",
Bought it for memory in the smartphone.  So far it does what it is supposed to. Remember what I save..,
Arrived fast.  Works with all my digital devices no issues.Haven't tested the speed yet but should be more than adequate for data transfer.,
This is the lowest priced 64 gb card I could find and it works great in my HERO go pro camera,
Was not expecting a micro 30 MB within a standard ScanDisk.  Not much to write.  Performs as it should without any hassle.,
And works great. Slipped the card in place and with a small snap I was ready to go. My experience was very satisfied.,
"I put this in my Galaxy Note II and put a bunch of music and PDFs on it.  I also used it to save videos and photos.  It worked well for about 2 months then, on Christmas Day (today), it said that there was an error reading the card and the card was now blank.  My phone no longer recognizes the card and even putting it into its adapter and sticking it in the SDHC reader of my laptop doesn't work.If this is SanDisk Quality, then I am not impressed.  I am going to have to deal with their warranty replacement but I'd rather have a refund than get another card that might fail after 2 months...",
Works great.  Great for video capture since it is a class 10 rating.  Works as it should and the shipping was fast as well.,
for my Galaxy note 10.1.  This is necessary if you use the tablet as much as I do.  Don't get a smaller card.,

"I've been planning on getting a set top box for the past 2 years but just never found something that had everything I was looking for. Briefly browsing amazon a couple of weeks ago, I noticed they had their own recently release online media streaming device. After looking over the specs and capabilities, I thought it was about time to take the plunge - especially since we've been using Amazon Prime streaming services more and more now that our daughter watches kid shows (i.e. Dora, Umi Zumi, Blues Clues, etc.)Though we've only had it around a week, we're very happy with the purchase. We cut our cable over a year ago so plugging in the computer to the TV every time we wanted to watch something was beginning to get tiresome. Connection was straightforward and simple. On boot, it was automatically logged into our Prime account (not sure how it did this.)The interface is slick and really easy to find what you're looking for. It's very quick (not clunky) when browsing through video options and for some reason I think it looks better (could be mental, I know.) Another neat thing is that the remote doesn't have to have line-of-sight to the front of the box since it utilizes bluetooth. It's all about the simple things. Anyways, we're very happy with this little box.",
Works Ultra great. No complaints. I got the retail package.,
"I love everything about this case except for how it fits on the Echo Dot. I was expecting a snug fit however, it is very lose and so you have to make sure that if you pick it up to move it (and the power cable is disconnected), the dot will fall out of the case.",
"I trust these.  Got it long ago and it is still going strong.  Any large size storage needs to be reliable, If I buy the one or two gig cards I would just get the cheapest no name brand but for anything larger I get these.",
I got this for my Galaxy S 2 phone and it worked right away. I had an issue with the write times slowing down after a month so I issued an exchange. It came promptly and my new SD card works great.,

"UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more",
"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more",
"I purchased Sandisk because i thought it was the most reliable name brand out there. I have a Galaxy S3 and purchased this 32GB card to handle all my photo's and movies. I'd say over the last 4 months I haven't been using the storage for more than just photo's and the occasional movie. The device just failed on me yesterday, losing all my photo's and files. Thank goodness for DropBox auto-photo upload otherwise i would of permanently lost my photos.I actually went back to the Amazon branded microSD card (16GB) which is about as fast and so far, way more reliable than sandisk. I can't beleive a sandisk card failed, I'm probably going to RMA the unit and hope they send me a better unit. You can guarantee that i'm going to burn in the card to make sure there's no errors.I gave it one star because you think you pay a premium for a premium product. You expect it to be as near flawless as possible.",
"This is the second one of these that I've purchased.  The first was inexpensive, quick, and easy to install in my wife's Samsung tablet.  I was so impressed that I bought another to install in my Samsung.",

I pulled it out to try to retreive the vids using several PC's, multiple card readers, and recovery software but no good.

"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
He loves electronics around Christmas so this was right up his alley! He loves telling Alexa to do things like turn up the thermostat or to play songs,

"Got this for my Samsung 3.  After 4 months, was no longer accessible - first message I got on the phone was that there was an unformatted Sd card installed.  Next, it wouldn't even recognize the card was in there.  I inserted a different card, and the phone was able to recognize it and play music off it - - so, not the phone.  I also tried having my desktop read the card - - no go there either....",
This is a high quality easy to use product. Ready to insert and go! No problems with capacity or packaging.,

This speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by Alexa, and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound. The speaker quality is great for a portable option. The only thing that I don't like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right, but I can't knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem.",
"To begin, I am not that knowledgeable in tech matters so when I received a new Galaxy Note 2 as a gift and decided to add storage I read some reviews on the SD cards and was reading about the compatibility of the 64 GB cards (exFAT or Fat? I guess the exFAT was a successful diet), I was concerned somewhat but I ordered this one anyway and this is what my experience was. I added some music and videos onto the card using my Apple Macbook Air with no problems and then inserted it into the Note 2 with no problems and it immediately loaded everything with no problems. I have since taken it out and added some more music to it and it is working perfectly. I did not reformat or anything like that which was a great relief. Although I have only used this item for a week now with issue which means something could go wrong in the future, I would give it more than 5 stars if possible because it was easy for someone like me. I know I used the phrase no problems multiple times but when you are my age and things go smoothly with no problems it is very good.",
"I have owned three versions of the amazon echo: the original, the dot, and the tap. This is the most versatile of the three. The wireless recharging is great. The sound is not as good as the original, but the portability makes up for this. At $79 it was a fantastic buy.",
The microsd is faster that most and is very reliable. I can now hold all my music on my phone. The warranty is also decent on this card. I would recommend it to anyone especially at this great price.,
Still in the learning process--looking forward to more benefits!,
So far have not had any problems with the card.  Our movies have been great.  Beautiful color. Very clear and bright pictures.,
"Cons:1. Built on Android does not mean you can have Google Play Apps. This is an unfortunate inconvenience, as there are some Google Apps that are just better than their Amazon App counterparts, and a few that I can not find within the Amazon Apps. If you want a fully functional tablet, then buy a tablet and download the free kindle app. If you want to pay more for something that does less, then the kindle is for you. This was a gift, so I will keep it, and continue to use my phone for the rest of my Apps that are not available on the kindle.2. Camera is less than perfect. Limited settings available. Again, I will use my phone for pics, the same scene with my phone showed the flames, with a small amount of glare. (Husband is a firefighter, so I take a lot of pictures of their exercises for their training.) An old Casio Exilim C721 phone with 5MP camera still takes better pictures at night.3. Kindle unlimited... I can not find anything worthy of paying a subscription price every month for. The Authors I want to read are not included.4. Amazon Prime... See 3, They doubled the price, and to me I just don't see anything there worthy of the cost, including Amazon instant video, no shows that I watch are included. Another family member did the 30 day trial, and was quite disappointed when his content disappeared after the trial.5. Youtube videos work ok, sometimes choppy, could be my connection or the device (computer playback worked fine when I had the time to test simutaneously). Other online video from various sources would not play in Silk Browser, refer to 1 Chrome Browser not available to download.6. Office Suite... I can not figure out how to unlock documents. I can view them, but I can not edit them.Somewhere in the middle:1.Read more",
"It worked great in my Samsung Galaxy S3, and then failed after 3 months.  Have tried contacting Samsung via their warranty form on their website and I am not having any luck.  I gave up and bought a different 32GB card from NewEgg.com hopefully that one lasts longer.",
I purchased this to use in my Samsung camera and it works great. I take picture and videos with the camera with no issues.,
"I like my device to have enough storage so I finally purchased the 64GB version. Formatted the card and haven't fun into any kind of problem. Inserted it into my Samsun Galaxy 8 tablet, now it's complete.",
Got this for my Sansa ClipZip. It holds all the songs I have on my computer from the cd's I have downloaded. Great to have for extra data when needed.,
Works great in my Note II. No issues. Reads and writes fast. No corrupted files and my Note II had no issues reading this card. My friend bought an off brand card because it was cheaper and every so often he gets a &#34;card not found&#34; error. Good buy.,
"I wish I could say this card was great. Been waiting for it for around a year and a half whilst using the 64GB one (also SanDisk) which never gave me issues; sadly I lost it. This card confused the heck out of me. I used it on my S4 and first off, it wouldn't recognize it. Tried it on my gf's S4 and same problem.Apparently it comes formatted as exFAT and thought maybe reformatting it as FAT32 would solve the problem. Well I thought it did since my phone finally recognized it upon inserting it. A new problem arose, though. I started taking pictures to try it out and odd thing was some of the pictures became corrupted. Not even viewable on the phone seconds after taking them. Some worked, others not.Later on, I restarted my phone for some reason or other. A while later I wanted to check the pictures again and, surprise surprise, everything was gone. I'd find out later that every time I restarted my phone everything on the card was being deleted. Tried it on my gf's phone and same thing happened.Tried reformatting again as FAT32 using GParted (couldn't hurt) and it just throws errors upon starting the write sequence.Too bad I can't return it as I had it shipped to me in Guatemala. So that's $119 down the toilet. I have to buy a new one now, but I think I'll go for the new Samsung EVO ones (although they don't offer a 128GB model as of this writing - bummer).",
I use this with my Go Pro Hero 3 Black edition and it works great!  Get it! Buy it! Its definitely worth it!,
amazing storage and speed! what more could u want! its almsot cheaper then buying the full sized sd card z,
"Update on Dec 23 2013 - Please scroll to the very end of this review for 2 month use update. ...For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model. The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080). This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution. The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.Read more",
This is the reason why I love non-apple products. You can increase memory with microsd's and its so much cheaper. These class 10 Sandisks' are amazing. I've bought several from 64gb to 16gb and every single one has lasted. I've had the 64gb for months now and I have no issues. The 16gb I've had for a year and its great. I would highly recommend this product.,
"The Amazon Tap is a perfect complement to our Amazon Echo. Put this in our office space...has all the advantages of the Echo and is also a great Bluetooth speaker. Having to ""tap"" the mic button to summon Alexa is no issue at all! Sound quality is as good as any Bluetooth speaker on the market and it's extremely portable.",
"The first one i received died in less than 2 months. It just stopped reading (lost all that was on the card), but Sandisk customer service was excellent and replaced it. Not so enthused about the speed. Transfers between phone and PC (USB 2.0) weren't impressive in my opinion, slow, but the bottleneck could be the phone, but still...",
"I got the This memory card as a gift, to use it with my new ContourRoam2 camera, which according to a lot of users it shouldn't/wouldn't work with the camera. Even the technical team from Contour told me they are not optimistic that Ultra memories from SanDisk work their camera. Still It did for me!",
Received my card in a decent amount of time and it was packaged well . The memory card was crispy brand new and in perfect condition . After installing the card in my video camera it worked perfectly! Very good deal.,
"I got it at a good price, and it is nice to have 64GB of extra space for media to use in my phone.",
great little SD....,
Great Price and works great with my Samsung galaxy s4.Such a relief not having to worry about space for pix and apps.,
Has held data and transferred with my PC seamlessly.  So far no problems with corruption in 6 months.  Apps move from the phone to SD card very quickly.,
No issues at all. I ended up utttingthis in my Samsung Galaxy S3 instead of my Tab2 like I had originally planned. I will be ordering another one soon.,
"I was really excited for this speaker. Got it all hooked up to my echo and was ready to go. Then I listened to the music. It has no bass. If you want something the has a good range of sound, this isn't it. It is focused on treble only. No low end. I ended up getting the JBL Charge 3. Love it",
"So far we are very much enjoying the product. Great for outdoor use by the pool due to its portability. We have not had a chance to really test how long it can go without a charge but a couple hours has been no problem. Only catch is that you cannot stream a single Spotify account on more than one device at the same time, so if you find yourself purchasing the Dot or Echo you will not be able to stream using the same account at the same time.",
Works great,
"I bought this card as high speed external memory for my Asus ME302C tablet to play movies, music, etc. The card meets all of my expectations, and was pleasantly surprised to discover that it had absolutely no crapware preloaded. No compatibility issues whatsoever.",
Great product for the price.Gave me plenty of space to add videos and music.Works perfectly well with my Galaxy Note Tablet,
"I use it on my phone, it works well enough. Android doesn't like to use the card by default, so I have to move things manually, but that's beside the point. The card works well.",
"It's still very new to me, so I'm taking my time mostly I read a lot. But also like to play games. Haven't even started to look into theT.V. Movie's that I can get with my Wi-Fi, 32gb. Also like the color of my firer cover.",
"I use this in my GPS Unit (Older model) and it works great! No complaints. I use a 16 GB in my phone and it's more than enough room! Pictures, music, etc.",
"I put the 32 GB card in my Galaxy S3 and it is working as well as could be. I popped the SD card into the slot, went to settings-> Storage-> and selected 'format'. That was it. Then I set up an Mp3 folder which was instantly recognized by double twist and now I have tons of storage for music, pics, and more. Great card.",
not much to be said about this. sandisk makes some of the best SD cards..i have even washed mine in the washing machine by mistake and it still works,
This is just the standard micro SD card i would recommend this to anyone. i purchased this for my dad who is using it to expand the memory on his tablet! it shipped fast and is a slight bit cheaper than in the stores i believe.,
Rolled the camera on the highest settings and till battery died. Card was fast and no complaints. Bought Two of these for my GoPro.,
I just plugged into my Samsung Note II and the phone recognized it without any issues. Everything worked perfectly.  I didn't have to format or mess with it in anyway.,
"Great capacity and never had to reformat it, blue tooth transfers work great from previous phone to this memory card.",
"I used this product with my Dell Venue 8 Pro.  After a couple months of use, it stopped letting me add new files or delete old ones.I tried reformatting and wiping the disk, but nothing worked.  Since the vast majority of the reviews appear to be positive, I assume I just got a bad one.",
"What can I say, the card works perfectly, haven't had a single issue with it. I had a sandisk card at one point that didn't work properly and sandisks customer service was great in replacing my product which is the reason I will keep giving them my business.",
"I ordered this before Amazon fixed their price and it cost $199 USD. The product is great however it is over priced at $199. I think their 128gb Thumb drives go for about $79 USB and were on sale at brick and mortar stores for $69 last week.This is a product that should have been released at least 24 months ago and Sandisk is a company that likes to drag its feet and squeeze people with older cards like the 64gb cards.All I can say is where are the 256gb, 512gb, 1TB and 2TB Micro SDXC UHS-I or UHS-II cards? (They all use the ex-fat file system) I have tested my GS3, GS4, Note 3 and Note Pro 12.2 with this card and all of them read it just fine.",
What can i say its a micro SD.  It serves its purpose and it works just so.  I would recommend to others,
was a decent price for the amount of memory.  Had no issues reading it on my old HP6910P laptop built in card reader.  No problems so far.,
"Works perfectly.  Nothing else to say as it's just a memory card and it holds the pictures and videos I put on it.  I would not say anything, but again, you need 20 word minimum.",
"It is reliable sd card. I always used this brand for all of my camera, my smartphone and tablet.Fyi",
I use it to store movies for my kids to watch on theirAndroid Tablet. It works flawlessly. Price finally down to earth.,
I just removed the back cover and plugged this into our new Galaxy S4 and the phone recognized it immediately (indicated had 59.47GB of storage available on SD card) ... I loaded some pics and videos on it for good measure and it works fine...recognized the SDXC.  I assume it is file system formatted for exFAT.,
Worth the $30 I spent here then buying it at the store for $65.  Use it for the Galaxy note 10.1 and the Galaxy Note 2!,
"I have not utilized the card as much as I had hoped I would, so I cannot comment too much on the speed, but my tablet (Asus Transformer Infinity) certainly has plenty of space on it now.",
"Popped this into my Nvidia shield for extra storage. It was recognized instantly and was easy to transfer files over.I haven't had it for too long to comment about failures in some of the reviews, but will update accordingly. So far recommended!",
Very nice addition to a Xperia Z tablet expanding the storage area up to 64 Gigs. Easily seen by OS of my Tablet. Fits micro slots,
"This card was used in a phone without a large amount of write stress (which does shorten the life of the card - it was not written to over and over in the phone).The card is now totally unwriteable - on a Mac, a Linux machine, or the phone - writes all ""seem"" to succeed but even low-level reformats don't actually *do* anything - the exact same files are there after every change, untouchable and frozen forever.10 months of use out of a memory card and then a really weird failure like this (neither the Mac, Linux machine, or phone reports any error) is not acceptable quality from SanDisk.",
a fast memory card with room to spare at an amazing price. Suitable for Lots of Smart Phone Movies Fastest storage available today IMHO!,
I was using a basic memory card in my Samsung Note 3 and when I took a picture it took forever for the phone to put it in the memory card and get ready for a new picture. Once I installed this Sandisk the transfer was almost non-existent. What a difference. Worth the few extra bucks.,
I bought this memory card because I love to have a lot space in my fhone o or computer and seems to work very well i love it. i recommend this product!,
What to be said???  Extra memory chips for my Gopro.  Small and compact for traveling.  They travel and work great,
I would recommend it. It is fun to use and puts out good sound.,
love it and love sandiski have had a SD fail and they replaced it. so i felt no reservations about buying this over another brand and have had no problems.,
Popped it in my Nvidia Shield and it worked instantly.  Transfers to it are faster than the transfers to the internal storage.,
Quick initial test with multiple settings from 30p 1080 to 4K 15p recordings successful.Haven't done long recording field use in warm locations yet.,
I put this in my Android to hold pictures music and all other items.  It works like a charm and a lot of room still for memory.  This is blazing fast too.  I am happy with this.,
"I was a little disappointed since it came without a box. So, where do I leave the adapter while the card is in the camera?",
"I run this in my Samsung Galaxy II. Works like a champ and it's really fast. Unless your phone supports exFAT this is as big as you can go. It might find it, but you will only be able to use 32GB...that's why the file system is called FAT32.",
its ffast light weight.. great price nothing to say here.. just a memory carduse it for my gopro hero 3 black,
"First off, I received my new Kindle this morning. I previously owned the Kindle Keyboard, but actually really didn't like the keyboard or the way the buttons were pressed together. I'm not a fan of touch screens so I bought this one.There are a few things to know about this particular Kindle that can help you decide if it's right for you...Here is a list of things to know about this Kindle.1. You'll be using an onscreen keyboard with the 5-Way Controller. This is not a problem for setting up WiFi and a little writing but if you are an avid note-taker or do a lot of writing with your Kindle, you might want to opt for the Kindle Keyboard.2. NO AUDIO - If you are planning on listening to audiobooks, Mp3s, or Text to Speech on your Kindle, this is not the device for you. There is not even a headphone jack, so there is absolutely no audio support.3. 2GB! This device has 2GB of storage, which is half of all the others... if you seriously need to keep over 1,400 books or so on your Kindle, you should opt for one of the others, all of which have 4GB. I only keep a hundred or so books on mine and the rest are up in the Amazon Cloud waiting for convenient download.4. There's no 3G version but the WiFi works just fine.5. There is a shorter battery life. Amazon reports the battery life is only one month of reading, compared with the others that clock in at two months. If you are going to be away from electricity for over a month, first of all RESPECT!, second of all, you may want a Kindle that has the 2 month battery life.6. It's lighter than all the other versions. It weighs in at just under 6oz (170g). The closest competition is the Kindle Touch which is about 7.5oz.7. It has 5 buttons on the face at the bottom.Read more",

"I ran the Disk Utility function in Ubuntu Linux 12.04 LTS.  Minimum Read - 13.7, Maximum read 15.1, Average Read 14.9. That's more than acceptable, given the Class 10 designation.",
"I experienced absolutely no problems with this memory chip.  It came in undamaged, it connected to my phone immediately and worked flawlessly.  I would highly recommend this chip!",
"This is an awesome product. I had received a Kindle Paperwhite as a Christmas gift, and it has since become an indispensable part of my daily life. The fit and finish of that product is top notch, and so I was eager to see if this one matches the quality I have come to expect from Amazon.Short answer: it does. Everything works perfectly, and I still have trouble believing that they packed this much awesomeness into such a small box. Having had bad experiences with streaming video in the past, I was a little wary about trying this, but I needn't have worried. Browsing menus is fast, the voice search works great, and watching movies is flawless. A nice touch is all of the detailed help videos which are included as the first thing you see after you set up the device.Even setup is easy, fast and fun. Hook it up to the TV, plug it in, enter network password, wait for a short update, and that's it, ready to go.Nice job, big A. Keep this up, and you will force me to buy all of your products.",
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
As described.  Haven't had issues so far.  Put this into a Samsung tablet and it worked as expected after standard formatting.,
"I have both a PAD and a phone. With one of these in each I can take the card out and read it directly on my computer. also if I wnat to load some pictures or movies, I just put them on the card and put it back in the PAD or phone. I don't need to subscribe to looney tunes or whatever they call it. I can just put on or take off what I want without a third party being involved. Very nice indeed.",
Love the speaker and the assistance of Alexa. Was trying to choose between this and a regular Bluetooth speaker and this was a better choice for my needs.,
"While not quite as fast as I was expecting it to be, it works perfectly and smoothly.  I bought this for my new Droid Razr when we moved to a new carrier.  It did take a few minutes for my computer to recognize it, causing me to think the card was bad, but it eventually did recognize it and allowed me to move everything from my previous card to it  (via the desktop).  I also put a few movies on it and so far, watching them on the phone has been flawless and smooth.  It's only been in my phone for a few weeks, but I have no complaints what-so-ever at this point.  Excellent card.",

Alexa works great. It was easy to set-up and to us. My wife uses it for playing music through her iPhone and is very happy with it. I am always finding and learning new things with Alexa.,
I got a note 2 and needed more memory  well this is the one to get. I have had no problems with it. Recommended,
"Ok so my Dad needed a MicroSD for his GS3 (Galaxy S 3) because he was using way to much space with videos and pictures; he isn't one of the most tech saavy people in the world so I got this for him. Does it work yes it does and very well I might add. Like I said my Dad doesn't work to well with tech and if a MicroSD slowed his phone down when it saved pictures or videos or ran apps from it he wouldn't be happy and wouldn't know what to do with the problem. This card experiences no lag (3 months in) the UHS-I speed class really lives up to its potential here. Best of all, perhaps a little known fact to most of you, this card is waterproof, so you get your phone wet and it dies, don't worry this card is still perfectly fine just pop it in a new phone and there's all your stuff! No cons as of yet will update as needed.",
Would buy the cheaper one than I bought.The echo is a better product,
"Works like a memory card should work.  Saves stuff, deletes stuff, transfers stuff, and its just good for lots of stuff.  No problems so far.",
Above average speed and perfect for the photographer needing ample file space. Can easily be used as a micro or SD card in different format cameras.  Fair pricing.Cons:  NONE,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"I use this card in my Samsung Galaxy S3 and have not had any issues with it at all. I have had other brand memory cards which have failed and become unreadable in the past, this however has accepted anything I throw at it. I use it to store all pictures that I take on the phone (currently 1,700+), music and videos. I have mp3's and a few movies on it and there is never any lag or random un-mounts. I highly recommend it.",
"Shop around, and you will be surprised how good of a deal this is.Combine it with something else to get free shipping, and it's a low cost winner.Technically speaking it works great, especially for a Go Pro Camera which will benefit greatly from the enhanced storagecapacity.Put it in a digital camera, and you won't need to worry about running out of space.Just bought my second one, that's how much I like/recommend it",
"We already had an Alexa but this one is a great addition. It's portable, rechargeable and good sound.",
This came with the adapter to allow the card to be used as a micro card or a standard card.  It is great and because it is class 10 it is also fast!,
"I have 4 of these in use in different devices.  I have had no issues with any of these cards, they're all still working great.",
I am enjoying it so far. Great for reading. Had the original Fire since 2012. The Fire used to make my eyes hurt if I read too long. Haven't experienced that with the Paperwhite yet.,
"I debated between the tap and echo, and this went on sale just before Xmas for such a great price at Best Buy. That helped to make up my mind pretty quickly!",
"I have two of these that I am using with a GoPro HERO3 and they work great (I will be getting more!).  While I could do the 64GB, I (so far) am preferring the 32GB, because the card is about full right when a battery reaches the end of it's life so I can swap a card and battery at the same time and save opening/closing the case and swapping parts all of the time.  The card is plenty fast, never had any hiccups with that and they have proven to be quite reliable as I have a 3rd card that I have been using in multiple mobile phones (HTC and BB) since 2010 and have never had any problem at all with any of them.",
"Works perfectly with my GoPro 3.  No issues with write times and works as expected.  No issues with losing anything stored or corruption, which is highly important for anything camera related.",
"I bought this card for my hero3 because the 64 GB card that i bought with the camera is not readable on my Ipad4. This card has been through its paces and supplies great video that I can review on my ipad immediately, with supplied SD adapter.",
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
"So I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on sd cards, but I still like this one. It is relatively inexpensive, works wonderfully for the movies I want to store and watch on my samsung galaxy tab 7 2.0, and I haven't had a single problem with storage yet.",
"Turns my smartphone into an iPod effectively! You can store music, pictures, videos and more on it. It can be accessed directly with an adapter or indirectly via micro USB to USB (2.0, 3.0). Would highly recommend!",
"i got it to expand the memory on my galaxy note 2.  love it. can hold almost a whole years worth of pictures and videos and other docs.  if my phone took a larger one, i'd get that one too.",
I have had no problems with this memory card. Owned it a couple years and transfered it from phone to phone.,
Having to press to talk steals the real thunder of what the amazon echo can do.,
Just what we needed to replace the memory card in my phone.  This is a dependable brand and a reasonable price,
Whats not to like? It is what it is. I always buy this brand of cards and drives. They have never failed me.,
"Bought 3 for the kids tablets for christmas.  All 3 worked perectly,  I would definitely buy again if the need arises",
"Worked great for about six months in my s4 and last week it started having device connectivity issues.  The phone keeps saying ad card removed, resetting the phone lets the memory card work for maybe 30 minutes.  Very frustrating.I have 30 gigs of media, I would appreciate scan disk resolving this issue with me and the product",
So far so good works as described and on my LG Motion 4g android smartphone.  Speed is pretty good too even though it reverts back to class 10 on this phone.,
"Using this in a security camera that I have mounted outside. It does the job of recording the pictures and video. The first one failed and had issues, but this second one seems to be working well.",
"Using the card for videos and music, have already filled it up and it works great playing back my media!",
"It does what it should, came a the right price and was shipped quickly.  I can now store many extra things on my phone...!",
"I was a bit apprehensive about getting this SD card as I had heard that it was not compatible with my Galaxy S III.  I did see one review that said it worked just fine on his S III, so I took the gamble.  I got the SD, immediately reformatted it, which was recommended by a Galaxy representative (I do this all of the time anyway to get any &#34;bloatware&#34; off of the card!), plugged it into my phone, and it worked just fine!  I would definately recommend this SD card!!",
A great looking cover for the Echo Dot. It gives the Dot a softer and more elegant look. I feel that it is a little pricy for what you get but I do not regret my decision to buy this case.,
"As background I own several Apple TVs, Roku 3's and Chromecasts. Along with plenty of other devices. I also have a large investment in BluRay and DVD, having had over 5,000 films during my peak of building out a Home Theater. With that comes a substantial UV (Vudu Flixster) and Digital Copy library (iTunes).Initial usage of the Fire TV has shown me that this box is fast and flexible. The voice search is excellent. BUT for some reason the search only picks up Amazon content. It does NOT currently show available media on Flixster or Netflix. This is for something that was touted as an open ecosystem, and not a proprietary one. Well then, how do I access my existing libraryWorse, but along with the previous point easily fixable is the fact that my only access to my UV library is through Flixster. Flixster works great on a tablet. But for some reason the Fire TV is not properly caching the content of my movies, so everytime I launch the app it takes minutes to show the content. Further all recent films are NOT available in HD. This is a huge hole in the openness and functionality of the Fire TV.I can't search on my content.I can't watch much of my content in HD.Easy fixes, but a hard sale for someone who owns a Roku or Apple TV.Fire TV needs VuDu as an app, and access to the iTunes library that folks own to be truly open. I'm vested in UV, and Amazon should take note of that as folks like me are typically the leading edge. UV has matured, and Amazon needs to be a much better partner.UPDATE 4/3/2014 I talked to Amazon.com and they confirmed that NetFlix chose to not enable the search functionality, thus the Fire TV search does not bring up NetFlix content. The same appears true for Flixster, and they confirmed that Fire TV is not currently a supported HD devices for Flixster content. All fixable, but ultimately making the Fire TV currently a closed eco systems with no real access to UV or other parties digital content that customers may already own. It's a tough pill to call up a search for content you own, and only be presented with purchase options from Amazon.",
Used in my gopro. it holds a massive amount of video. No problems with it. It does what it is supposed to.,
"works great ,perfect in my GS3, popped in and ready to go.Can't beat the price and quality of this card.",
I bought this microSD card to expand the storage on my Surface Pro - it works seamlessly and is easy to swap out - definitely a worthwhile purchase.,
"It is almost unbelievable that these micro SD cards can range in sizes up to 64Gb !  and at a class 10 to boot. Pun intended.Comes with the SD adapter, so it will work in any device that uses and SD or Micro SD memory card, just be sure to check whether or not your device can handle the extra memory. Some devices with recognize only 8 Gb or 16 Gb, which means that unless you check with the manufacturer, it is your fault you bought the wrong size memory, and you will not be able to exchange due to YOUR MISTAKE.This card used to cost upwards of $120 not that long ago, and now they are ridiculously cheap, especially for the quality and capacity you are getting.Thanks",
"so far working great, I'm using on my dell venue 8 pro and is working fine, no issues",
How cool it is to be able to put ALL of my music on my phone! The little card works just fine and the price is reasonalble,
Great little card. I have had issues with my phone chewing them up and spitting them out pretty frequently this card seems to have solved that issue for me.,
Used this in my GoPro camera.  Works great.,
A great product and a very reasonable price.  It has increased the Galaxy Tab 2 memory and useability without having to deal with other interface cables.,
"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more",
"The Tap works great, just like Alexa's little helper.",
"Installed this a few days after receiving my Galaxy Note III can stuff it with more music than most Ipods, and tons of movies.I've not had any problems, and it is fast!",
"It works as described. I bought 2. One for me and one for my wife's tablet. I love Amazon and the ease of purchasing with super fast shipping. Item came in retail packaging that is hard to remove. They have to do this in stores to prevent theft. Just use scissors, you'll get it out eventually. It shows 29.71 gigs when installed but this is typical for SD cards. Download the Sandisc memory Zone App to see how fast a card you need before you purchase one. It tells you exactly what you need and may save you a few bucks.",
"I purchased this for my GoPro Hero3+ Black Edition and it works PERFECTLY!I use my GoPro for car riding, snowboarding, cliff jumping and much more.The 64GB SanDisk will for sure capture every moment of my life.",
"I bought this the day it came out for the great price of $119.99 and it finally showed up a month later. (I knew this going in). I put it in my Galaxy note 3 and it instantly recognized it and I was set.Speeds in my laptop via the included adapter ranged from 15-30mb read speed and about 12mb write speed. I copied an entire 64 GB card over to this one, and it took some time, but now I have double the space.",
I bought two of these. One for my Galaxy S3 and the other for my Samsung Tablet. Had no problems using it with either one. A definite must have.,
"This Amazon tap is not only a great Bluetooth speaker, which is half of the reason I bought it for. But it also has some awesome voice control. I bought a wemo switch, plugged it into an old lamp, setup some commands with ittt, and in 5 minutes I was using my Amazon tap to control a lamp. Pretty cool. I love this Amazon tap it is light, portable, smart, has a great dock so I don't have to fuss with cables, and it has a 9 hour battery life, so I can go all day playing music.Being a Google play music subscriber The only thing missing from this speaker IMO, is a way to wirelessly stream my Google play music to this device using Alexa that is built in. You can use iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, prime music, heck even Apple iTunes got some love, but no Google play music. Come on Amazon show me some love. I pay 15 dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and 5 family members access to Google play music and YouTube red. So it would be nice to use it on my tap. But alas the Amazon tap is a Bluetooth speaker so I can always use my phone as a streaming device, or hook my phone up through the aux port as well. But all in all this is a great speaker, that can do everything any Bluetooth speaker on the market can do plus a little bit extra.",
i give this memory card a 5 star because it works like a charm easy to use plug and play. The packaging is easy to open so you don't have to worry about damaging the card itself . Slipped it right in my Samsung galaxy S-3 maxing out the card slot with this SanDisk 64gb but it only displays (59.47gb) its stable and fast works really good. didn't have to format anything or do any extra steps to use it. i recommend this to everyone,
I bought this card for my Phone. It gave me the extra storage for my pictures and video that I needed.,
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
I am not a technical person who can give all the specs on this but I put it in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and it works fine.,
"Bought this for Canon Powershot N because it takes a micro. I always use ultra or extreme pro sandisk, since they are my preferred brand, and I like them for had video and continuous snapshots. No problems with the card, came with working adapter. Happy with this purchase would and probably will buy more.",
I found the write bandwidth of this card is 15MB/sec when transferring a steady stream dozens of gigabytes.  The included full sized sdcard adapter appears to be slightly faster than my USB adapter.  I tested by piping /dev/urandom through pv onto the card.  Read bandwidth appears to be 18.1 MB/sec.,
"Do yourself a favor and pay the extra money for this card.Seriously, you spend all that money on a nice phone and it's like you're only using it at 1/4 or 1/3 of it's capability.Get this memory card and enjoy your phone how it's supposed to be run.",
"Thanks to reviewers, I knew what to buy, b4 we ever got our Galaxy3 cell phones, (gift from my niece), *will be here tomorrow--same day as our SanDisk! Thank you for your time sharing your thoughts and opinions!  It was/is appreciated!",
This memory card has been working flawlessly. Prices have been dropping nicely. Amazing the storage capacity in something so small.,
"I bought these in hopes to replace my standard Sandisk 64gb models for quickness.  I'm not saying they are lightning fast, but they are definitely faster than the standard version.  I bought one for each of my phones and my tablets,  They work great.  When the 128gb is available, I will try the faster version of those also.",
"I'm using this SD card in my Samsung Galaxy S3 instead of another one I bought with the same manufacture ""SanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFP"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007KFXIDE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc;=1).It's working perfectly since October 2012.",
"Great toyreal tablet. It is basically a real Fire 7 tablet, with kid's built-in entertainment center. There are 2 modes here: Parent (admin) and Kids (one or multiple accounts). When in Parent mode (password protected), the Fire 7 looks and feels just like an Android tablet with all of the Fire 7 functionality (Facebook, Netflix, Books, blah, blah), so all of us Android users feel right at home. In the Parent mode you can also manage kids accounts: how much they can use the tablet per day, what they can and cannot watch/play, manage their installed apps, ect. When in kid's mode, the tablet behaves just like it is on the pictures, easy-to-use, colorful interface. You need to click switch user to switch from Parent to Kids accounts.Some confusion here I got from reading other reviews- the kids apps are not pre-installed the main interface is an app store, just like Google Play, ect. The apps here are unique to this Kids Account, and are all free with the included subscription which includes don't know how many games, Amazon Videos, reading and audio books. You still have to download each app before using it, so make sure to stock up on apps before going on a road trip.",
"If you look through the reviews you will see that this card seems to have both a failure rate and a incompatibility with some devices. I bought this card in November of 2012 and it worked great for a while. The card started failing in my Galaxy Note 2 in the beginning of January. After reformatting and trying the card in other devices it still does not work. Please understand that this is not a user error but appear to be something wrong with the card itself. I have tried the card in 3 different phones. 1 with stock Jelly Bean, 1 with Ice Cream Sandwich, and 1 with a Cyanogenmod custom firmware. All 3 devices have problems and say ""blank sd card"" or ""unsupported filesystem"". Even formatting the card in both Windows and using Android do not seem to fix the issue. I was happy to find such a good price on a large microsd card but sadly it looks like you get what you pay for. It does appear that some people are having luck so it might be worth a gamble of $20 if you are feeling lucky. If you do buy this card it would be wise to double check your backup process to make sure you do not lose pictures or videos if you have this problem. I am glad I used dropbox for my phone so I did not lose any pictures or videos.",
This is a great microSD card. It is fast and the 16 gb gives me lots of capacity on my smartphone.,
Tested it by storing some apps and taking a few pics and videos.I am not techie enuf to run any specific tests.,
Great add-on if you own a amazon fire stick and like to play games. works well and I would definite buy it again.,
This is a nice compliment to my echo. Connected to my bt speaker it is actually a step up and less expensive than the echo. If I had it to do over again I'd have bought 2 of the dots instead.,
Shipped fast and worked really well!  I use this just in case I have to take a lot of photos! Loads fast!,
Excellent item for the price. Class 10 is the way to go if you're uploading or copying files to your computer. I have a 32gb as well and they both work well. No issues.,
"Fast saves in my Nikon Coolpix S8200. Here's my test: I was traveling with my tablet, laptop and camera, when my laptop crashed. No longer able to transfer photos from camera to laptop via my class 10 SD card, I bought the only microSD card that the big box store had (a class 4). The class 4 microSD card with adapter worked in my Nikon Coolpix but I kept seeing messages to wait while the card finished saving. Since switching to the SanDisk microSDHC class 10, there have been no more wait messages on my camera.",
"Bought two, one for wife and one for self.  Great price and fills the bill.  Great expanded memory for my Samsung G-III andoid.",
A great looking cover for the Echo Dot. It gives the Dot a softer and more elegant look. I feel that it is a little pricy for what you get but I do not regret my decision to buy this case.,
I use this primarily to store music and photos on my SD card. The camera writes to the card directly and I notice no difference in speed. I haven't had any formatting issues. First thing I did when I popped this into my phone was format it using the built-in option under &#34;Settings.&#34; It has worked flawlessly for over a month.,
"I always use SanDisk so they were my first (and only) option when I got my GoPro.  They are fast and they are good.Can't say too much, SanDisk makes the best cards, period.",
"Works great with my Contour camera's.  I can film 1080p/30fps mp4's with no problems using these cards.  Also, the 32GB means the battery dies before the card fills up.  If you're looking for a high capacity micro-SD card then look no further.",
I was looking for a solution to consolidate all the pictures I had on my Lenovo Tablet 2 (comes with built-in 64MB and a Micro-SD reader where I had a 64GB card full). This was a great find and I have not moved all my files to this 128MB card. I don't see any speed issue but did not do a formal test to check the capacity.,
"High speed, high capacity of storage. Great durability. I use in my phone and in my digital camera. Work very good",
"All in all I love this remote! It's pretty small and find myself constantly digging for it in between the couch cushions. My original remote is still functioning but will stop working from time to time. I bought a replacement to be prepared for when it died!!. I almost thought i received a doa replacement as it took me several tries to get this to pair up! i followed the instructions verbatim several times with no luck. Even put in brand new batteries just in case the ones provided were dead, Nothing!!! Here is how i paired mine just in case anyone else is experiencing the same issue give these steps a try prior to filing a return.1 If your original is still working remove the batteries so it will go offline.2 Make sure replacement remote has new batteries (sometimes the ones provided are dead)3 Unplug the power to your fire box/stick (this will make it restart)4 Plug the power back in to your fire box/stick5 Wait for the home screen to load6 Hold down the home button on the replacement remote until it pairs up (this now forces the device to pair to the replacement remote as it is the only remote online)7 Once it pairs select the new remote from the list (done)8 You will notice your old remote is still paired but offline9 Now you can put the batteries back in the old remote and both remotes will work simultaneouslyHope this helps anyone having issues with the pairing process CHEERS!",
"I've wasted time and money trying other company's SD and MicroSD cards, some work all right, and some died on me, it's not the price that you pay but rather the value that you get. Let me tell ya, SanDisk makes the best memory cards, period..... I bought one of this card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone, mostly for movies and music. I usually use AnyDVD & Handbrake programs to convert movies (large MP4 also playable on my Samsung tablet) and simply copy-and-paste movies and musics on this little card. Both my phone and tablet read this card without any problem and I cannot imagine my phone without it. Now I've bought 2 more....",
"I was debating whether to get the stationary Alexa device or the Tap and decided on portability. It's been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we're on a roll. I use it for play lists at work, alarm clock announcement by Dan Marino and news briefs. It's surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so I could take it with me while fishing.",
Great price for the product. Class 10....good name brand. Way cheaper than at the wireless atore. With lifetime warranty. Too.,
SanDisk is a company you can trust and offering such a good product at a low price.Comes with an adapter and small case to get full sd card size and keep it from getting lost when not in use.,
"I get 59.8GB of space on this in my Razr Maxx. I swapped it in in place of the factory 16GB one and had the system format it. It caused the phone to reboot, but after a reboot I had the full storage space. Seems quick enough to load... have not done full file transfer tests but loading 1700 songs onto it took about a half hour.",
Prices on memory go down all the time. This was a good sale price when purchased. SanDisk has always worked flawlessly for me.,
I love the class 10 uhs memory card thank you onedog,
Will have to buy a couple of more since I plan on using them to store my dive recordings from hero pro 2 with the adapter.,
Overall great price per gigs  real money saver . Expands my tablets memory 10 fold as well as keeping it from crashing,
Seemed to work as advertised.  But my first one failed abruptly after one week.  My smartphone failed to &#34;see&#34; it.  But Amazon replaced it at no additional charge.  The second one is still working fine.  (My smartphone is a Samsung S4G.),
"Let me guess: you love books, but you're not sure you want to get a kindle because you love the feel of books, rightI'm here to tell you that the kindle is the perfect balance of book and digital format.SHORT REVIEWYes, you should buy a kindle. Get the paperwhite with no ads. You're welcome.LONG REVIEWI love physical books too, I'm with you. But I know myself, and I know that once I forget to take the book I'm reading with me, that's it. I'll start another book and rarely finish the first. I also know if I try and read on my phone or iPad that I'll get distracted and start wondering about what's happening on the internet (Instagram's not gonna scroll ITSELF). Either way I'm not finishing the book.WHY KINDLEThe kindle takes the best of both worlds and mashes them together. The e ink display is honestly incredible. I wish iPhones had an e ink display. It really looks just like a printed page. So you get the experience of reading a physical paper book, but with the perks of being digital.Namely:- Share what book you're reading to Goodreads, Facebook, or twitter (so you can look SMORT)- Built in dictionary (so you can learn the proper spelling of the word SMORT)- Export your highlights as a PDFPlus, it'll also sync with the kindle app on your phone so you can squeeze in the final few pages of the chapter while you're in the bathroom (don't pretend you don't do that. You're either on your phone or you're reading the febreeze ingredients)READING IN BEDThe backlight looks great. It's a perfect size.Read more",
There really isn't anything bad you can say about a well performing Micro SDHC. It gives me good speeds and works fine in my devices. There may be a bit of confusion given its look but this is an SDHC Micro SD in case anybody was confused or wondering. 32GB is the official max of SDHC devices so be careful if you see 64GB SDs.,
"Works great, Plug & PlayLoads of room for whatever your needs are.I would not hesitate to recommend this product.Great card, Great price!",
it is amazing how much storage they can fit into such a small form factorremember 1.5 mb floppy disks ?heck this thing is soooo small you might lose itits like pinky nail size smalland holds 64 GB ! awesome,
This sd card was exactly what we were looking for. The last one we purchased got deleted and unformatted by the phone so we decided to replace it. This is a great price and came with the adapter too.,
"What is there to say about a sd card. It works, and it's a class 10 card. The price was decent. I needed one for my android tablet, shopped around and this one seemed like the best choice.",

Using dbpoweramp I was able to rip my entire collection to this card at a reasonable quality level. That's the point. Make sure it is compatible with your device before you buy.,
This card is great for the money and performs adequately. I recommend this product to anyone who needs a memory card.,
It works like sed it dose it's fast and works in my Xoom and have used it in my hd1010 xacti camera with an adapter.,
"I bought this for my Samsung Note 3 so I could store my entire music library on my phone. All I had to do was pop the cover, and put it in the microSD slot, and it worked perfectly! My phone now has 96GB of storage. Take that iPhone!",
Sandisk is the best out there and this ultra is even better!  Currently using it on a dashcam I have installed in my vehicle.  Its a shame smart phones seem to be going away with external memory so they can eventually start charging you for cloud storage.,
superb quality!seems to never gets full..got it sooner than expected..did my research before making my move and i was sold with sandisk,
"Excellent used to upgrade the capacity of my ASUS TF-700-X tablet, has greatly enhanced the abilities of the tablet, easy to use and to transfer information as necessary.",
I just received this micro sd card. Everything works so far. I purchased 2 for my Galaxy s5 and my tablet. So far so go.,
"Good quality. I've been using it several devices (phone, tablet, and computer) with no troubles at all. Glad I chose this one.",
"I reformatted to FAT32, transferred all the files from my old phone, put this in my Galaxy S3, and have hardly thought about it since. It's huge and just works reliably.",
And does what is says it will. What else can really be said about memory cards?? They either work or not.,
Its great for using on my camera and speed is pretty good so cant complain. I just think the price could be little bit more cheaper since there are a lot of generic versions out there !!,
"Good sound but unlike Echo, you have to press a button on the device to have it do what you want it to do. I ordered a Dot so this may solve that issue.",
"This chip replaces my previously fried out offbrand microSD.  So far it has performed flawlessly.  If it fails, I will update the review.  I have a Droid RAZR M smartphone.",
I wanted a good sized SD card for my Android phone. This one was priced well and has been working without a glitch.,
Excellent storage and small!  Works well and does everything I need it to plus it came in at a good price.,
"I bought one for myself and a couple as gifts, it's cute but still haven't figured out what's so great about it. I will say that it does pick up your voice throughout a huge room.",

"Update: providing an update with regard to SanDisk support.I bought the memory card in Aug 2012 (see original review below). In May of 2013 while on my cruise to Alaska the card went bad. During the sailing out of San Francisco it was fine as I used it to take a panorama shot of the Golden Gate Bridge. For most of the cruise I was using my DSLR but the next time I wanted to use my cell phone, the phone told me I had no memory card loaded.  Any way, tested the card on my laptop when I got back and it couldn't recognize it. I contacted SanDisk via email and provide them copy of my receipt from Amazon along with the serial number on the back of the card (very hard to read) and no problems; they told me to send them back the card and they sent me a brand new card which is now still functioning in my cell phone.  Great support provide by SanDisk. No hassle as long as you can provide proof of purchase (easy to do since Amazon keeps my entire purchase history/invoices online).  One reason I buy directly from Amazon itself vs other vendors (either on Amazon or elsewhere on the Internet) is that I have confidence that the memory cards sold by Amazon itself are genuine.  there may be incredible deals elsewhere on the internet but in some cases the deals are too good to be true and counterfeit cards are being sold.Original review:Just received this today. Removed it from the packaging and inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3 (Verizon) and powered the unit back up and the storage was available.  No formatting required. Worked the first time out. Settings showed 29.71GB of total space (32GB version) and 29.71GB of free space.  I like the fact that a SD adapter came with it.  Should I ever need to insert the card into my laptop it will come in handy. (yes I can plug my phone directly to my laptop but if I ever swap this 32GB card out of my phone and replace it with a 64GB version, I can use this 32GB version via the adapter for other purposes.)",
"I bought this about a month ago and I really like it. The best part is light in weight, sound is very good for small gathering like on the deck or camping and it comes with Batterey charger. The voice command activation is so great to have and listen all my music plus worldwide radios from TuneIn.",
"I trust the San Disk name and have no issues.  For a phone, Class 10 is a must.  Good price for this product.",
I bought these for my kids tablets and for their action cameras. They work in those 2 devices. Some other devices seem to like the slower cards.,
"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more",
Received promptly in envelope. Envelope inside which held plastic bag with clamshell. Card and adapter inside clamshell. I kept the clamshell for storage of other cards. I put this into my PALM TX PDA. YEP! Still use a PDA...works VERY well.,
"Bought this for my Samsung Galaxy Legend phone so I can store all my pictures and videos, works like a charm.",
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
"SanDisk chips are pretty good but relatively expensive at times.You'd think that online prices would be more affordable. It can be but you can Not tell if the seller is selling a fake product ot not.The one I received was genuine. Any of SanDisk products can be returned and exchanged for another if genuine so I've not had a problem in exchanges with the company **knocks on wood**!The 32gb version works well with Android tablets but not the 64gb versions so beware. I did read online at other forums that the 64gb version works relatively well, though, with Android phones, which is weird.Why would it work on the smartphone but not the tablet?Prices have dropped so it may have come down in prices at local retail stores so do shop around.",
"Got this to use with my GoPro Hero 3 black edition. Put it in, seemed to work. tried to get the data from the card after using it for a second and the card says it needs to be formatted.Looked to gopro's website and it is NOT on their recommended card list. Reason being is that the card isn't fast enough. It's a class ten yes but clearly not fast enough.Definitely get the recommended card, IF it does work at first it will probably die in a couple of days.",
This is the biggest memory card I have at 32 gig.  It works fine!  I am using it on an 8 inch Dell tablet with Windows 8 and a solid state 8 gig hard drive.,
"No issues in my little cell phones. works as advertised, priced well, no issues. not much more to say, but Amazon requires few more words ;)",
"Bought this for Samsung Galaxy S3 in Fall 2012 and that card works perfectly to this day.  Bought the same card in May 2013 for Galaxy S4 and it continuously mounts and unmounts.  Sometimes it is not even recognized by S4 or PC.  Amazon is awesome and pre-shipped a replacement.  It did the same thing, though.  According to Cnet, Sandisk acknowledged a &#34;manufacturing problem&#34; with these cards back in January 2013.  Said it was fixed, but the bad cards must still be sitting in warehouses.  Returned both and ordered Samsung's 64gb micro sdxc card.  $12 more and slightly slower read/write specs, but works perfectly in S4 and I can't tell the difference in its speeds compared to the Sandisk that works in my S3.",
"I travel for work. More and more, I find myself leaving the Kindle Fire at home and traveling with just an e-ink Kindle. So when I broke my Kindle 3, I decided to replace it with this entry level Kindle (without special offers).What's good:* Smallest, lightest e-ink Kindle available.* Still has the page turn buttons!* Like all the e-ink Kindles, this thing has amazing battery life.What's just OK:* Only 2GB memory. More is better. Then again, after two years of buying books I'm nowhere near filling this thing up.* Text entry using the 5-way switch works, but that's about all. I'm surprised it works well enough that I can't consider it a negative.What's not so good:* The lighted cover costs nearly as much as the Kindle! Anyone thinking of picking up this Kindle and the lighted cover should look at the new paper white models with integrated frontlight.The new Kindles look awesome. But they don't take anything away from this Kindle. It may not have some of the bells and whistles of the other models but it also costs quite a bit less. The Kindle is exactly what I need for traveling. It works wonderfully as a basic, no-frills e-reader. Reviewing it as such, I have to give it five stars.",
"Ever since my SanDisk Ultra 64GB Micro SDXC card arrived, my life has been pure bliss.  Not only am I finally able to carry vast amounts of music, movies, and TV shows with me on my Samsung Galaxy Note 8, but my car now gets 14 more MPG, my landlord LOWERED my rent $300, I got a promotion at work, and my cat no longer sheds on the furniture!",
This is a great price for such big storage and it's does a great job with my first smart phone.,
I bought this for my daughters Samsung Galaxy Tablet. She wants to play music on it all the time and I don't want the expense of paying for a bunch of downloads. I bought this MicroSDHC and adapter and I can put it in my computers SD port and put music on it from her cd collection. Then all she has to do is put it in her tablet and play as much as she wants.,
"Works fine my Virgin Mobile HTC EVO V. The phone didn't recognize it at first, but after formatting it's all good.",
"I wanted to upgrade my 8gb microsd card for my Samsung Galaxy S3 with more memory. The SanDisk Ultra 64GB Micro Sd XC I class 10 memory Card works perfectly.  Recognizes with 59GBs available blank.  My Mp3s, Mp4s, WMVs, pyvs, etc. all play on demand and without delay or problem.  Amazon shipped it with trouble free packaging ahead of time using their free shipping option (USPS) and I couldn't be more pleased.  I highly recommend this memory card.",
"Sandisk seems to be the most reliable for me. Not only a good product, but good prices. Always good memory cards. Period.",
I needed some new micro SD cards for my Flash Boot Project and required stable speeds. Sandisk provided the product I required with optimal speeds and stability along with quality and warranty.,
"CompactFlash is just about perfect to use in a camera in the field. As the size shrinks, so does one's ability to easily handle the card. SD is getting marginal as far as usability in the field. Forget about changing a Micro SDHC card unless you are back at your computer! Too small to handle and easy to drop and loose!However, with the 32GB and 64GB cards, that's not quite an issue especially if you leave the card in the camera! The camera is larger than the card my a great deal. Set it down and it's a lot easier to find and handle than a micro card (shown twice as large as life when I was writing this review).My cards came with SD adaptors so that they would be useable in my work flow, a plus. Also, within the adaptor, I can use the card in devices with SD slots and download using my existing readers.",
"The refurbished Kindle looks brand new, I wouldn't even know that it was used. The only down side was that when I opened up the package, the Kindle was already on.",
The memory is fine but the adapter that it came with was useless.  I did not contact the seller about it since I had another to use.,
"Happy to have gotten this for a steal price! Definitely a lot of space than I need for my gopro or DSLR camera, but more is so much better than less!",
This was easy to set up I can access many movies and purchase new releases without going out of the house to search for a video store. I can also access my Netflix I love this and wondered how I ever lived without it. Thank you Amazon,
"I bought this for my new Galaxy Tab and it works flawlessly, nothing to complain about. I always use sandisk products and they have never fail to me. I have one of these (16 GB) on almost every device at home, digital cameras, phones and now in a tablet.",
I got this to use in my GoPro Hero 3+ and it fit and worked well. Since that camera did not come with a micro SD i was forced to find one and i choose this one because it was the cheapest i could find at the time. This made me a little weary of the product but after receiving and using it i have no complaints. It stores and preview the pictures/videos to the highest resolution and HD quality i had to preview them on. I looked at the pictures and videos on my 60 inch TV and it was like watching HD TV.,
I have never had a San Disk failure in 5 different camera's I use from GoPro's to a Canon 60D.  That are great memory cards.,
"I love this Micro SD because I used it as my main memory phone mostly because the Galaxy S4 it comes with a 9GB of free space. So I can pretty much just enjoy this Ultra 64GB for Music, Photos and Movies but not for Apps because my phone is not compatible with moving apps to the SD it stills works for other phones but not this one. I have to say this is one of the fastest Micro SD I ever bought recommended a lot.",
very overpriced!,
This card transfers data incredibly quickly!. One can notice the difference between a regular SanDisk memory card and this Ultra version. Great Memory and it was at a price I loved! (Using it for my microsoft surface pro and no problems with it),
Great new Light Weight cover/case for my new Canary Yellow Kindle. I wanted the case to match my new Kindle. What a great choice. I am so happy with both the case the Kindle. So bright cheerful. Just like a sunny day.,
Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it. Great music player with all the great Alexa capabilities. Opted for the Tap because I'm a bit weary of the Echo always listening.,
"I ordered the original Kindle keyboard 2nd gen the day it was available. Same with 1st gen Kindle Fire, and I own a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle PaperWhite as well. Having that familiarity with Kindles I hope gives me some credibility for the HDX 7. The speakers are the best in the line. The screen is amazing, the speed is unparalleled for gaming and streaming, which is the only possible challenge to prior models. In the spirit of full disclosure, I've only owned mentioned Kindles and a Samsung Galaxy smart phone, no iPads, Samsung tablets or Barnes Noble e-readers etc so take it from there. Can't speak to charging complaints because I keep a charging cord next to my bed and two more around the apt and I plug my phone in every night and my Kindle every morning when I awake. After 2 weeks, in one day my Kindle HDX has never been below 40 and average end of day is about 65 so I've never had one day of usage as an inconvenience. For those that find charging once a day annoying, hmm, two days should still be good for most average uninterrupted use. I also ordered the Origami case as its enclosure and I love it as well. Stands the device with equal stability in landscape and portrait, and feels protective for minor drops or spills.",
It does what it says but the price needs to come down. Alot. 3 stars bcuz it costs too much for what it is.,

Great,
"im currently using it for my nokia lumia 810 and my camera, works very well and very fast! but expensiveEdit: I was really happy with the card until I had to record video on it. It seems that it doesnt write fast and my recordings end up being choppy and unwatchable. I was really disappointed in it, cuz I had to switch back to my phone's storage when recording video.",
"I'm a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to compare the latest Kindle to. I don't own a Nook. I don't own an iPad (and, in any case, that's comparing apples to oranges). I don't have a Sony e-reader. 'This will be a short, simple review.I received my Kindle about a week ago and haven't been able to put it down.Things I like about my Kindle1. The e-ink display is amazing.2. Using the 5-way controller is simple and effective.3. Page turn speeds are faster than I thought they would be.4. It's lightweight, even with the attached cover (I have an Amazon cover with a built-in light)5. Page-turning buttons are quiet and well-placed.6. Recharge time is fast.7. I can order a book and start reading it in less than 60 seconds. Nice!8. Portability... I can take 3,000 books with me when I travel for work and not require additional suitcases or baggage fees.Things I'm not too keen on1. Buttons are too close together and are laid out oddly.2. Lack of individual number buttons is frustrating.3. Power button on the bottom Not a bad thing. Just an odd thing. (Same for the headphone input). I usually rest the bottom of a book on my lap when I read.Things I hope change in the future1. How books are organized... When I put a book in a collection (which is actually a tag), it still appears in the main list. It's not actually moved, it's merely associated.2. The look of the main screen. I'd like folders or some other way to display collections.3. Ability to create personal screen savers.4. E-book pricing, though Amazon has little control over this. Still, most titles are the same price as or less than their hardback/paperback counterparts.Read more",
"I bought this with Costco Black Friday deal and started using just a couple of days ago.  Today when I was transferring video files from my phone to the card, I wasn't able to because it stopped half way.  Now, nothing can be written on it.It was purchased from Costco, so it's not a fake Microsdhc card.  I tested it out its authenticity with an app on Google Play and verified that it's real too.  Still, it's a piece junk.  What is Sandisk doing to its reputation?I would advise shopper to choose other brands over this.  Surely, it's cheap; but would you rather lose all of the important files that you store in it?",
My gps has plenty more space now to update it's maps. It works so that is all there is to know.,
Bought this for a Samsung note 2014 ed. This will give me plenty of data storage as I will be using the note to some quick picture editing,
Works great in GoPro Hero 3+. Super fast and gives plenty of storage capacity to video every outdoor activity I need.,
Fit my needs nicely in my tablet.  No more buffering anything anymore.  And big enough to hold quite a few movies on.,
I have an older generation SanDisk 32GB card I bough in 2011 and this one is a lot faster!The red stripe design also make it stand out visually very nicely. (I wished the included adapter would be painted in matching colors instead of plain generic black like all other memory cards and adapters.),
I have the Echo and I just love it... I bought the Tap for my daughter for Christmas so she does not know she has it yet.,
"Do you spend lots of time on Amazon? Do you like listening to music anywhere in your home? This is the device for you. Even after a month of having the Tap, I'm still learning what all I can do with it verbally. Play genre of music in the HUGE Amazon library. I even have ordered items directly from it. One last feature I want to share is that it provides accurate weather information; current and forecast up to a week.",
"I bought this tablet for its size, economical price point, and the ability to watch content offline. And it offers exactly that...but falls short on performance parameters. If you're price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet, large screen, and the ability to watch content offline, this is a great device to get. However, if you already have an earlier Kindle like the HDX 8.9 or even an earlier version of the Fire, I recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn't really be a worthwhile upgrade. I have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device.The- constant freezing of the device,- slow speed to load apps,- significant lags when switching apps that only become worse as you load more stuff on the tablet,- erratic wifi connection that drops often and the ensuing trouble to connect back to the same network, and- the frequent need to reboot the device,all factors made this a frustrating device to own . The HDX is far better in every aspect, heck even the original Fire 7 runs better than this device.The only good things about this device are the screen size and the MicroSD slot. So if you're only watching videos on this, and would like to have the option of watching content offline when you're traveling, this tablet would be just fine. Otherwise, the HDX is still a better option, or you could get the 7 or 8 Fire models. Those are priced cheaper and work better.Original review is below---For the price point and size alone, the Fire HD 10 would seem like a good deal. For its performance, however, it falls short of expectations. I would probably rate it a 3.5 overall. If it wasn't for the price, the rating would have been even lower.Read more",
"Bought two of these. One for my Galaxy Note 3 and one for my wife's Samsung Charge 3.No pre-formatting was required. Simply take out of the case, pop into your phone, and they were recognized within seconds. Actual space is 59 gigabytes and some change, which is right on the money.",
"Performs as expected. I bought for mi Galaxy S3 to increase it storage options, when I need to transfer big files I use a usb adapter since the wifi and mtp conectios speed is far slower than directly connecting the device but that is not the cards problem. Its fast reading and writing inside the S3 and when connected to a current generation computer.Old computers will read and write at slower speeds, but is still compatible hardware wise. The exfat format can be a hassle.No problems yet hardware wise. I would have preferred an open standard as partition format instead of exfat, but that is Microsoft fault not Sandisk.Is easy to reformat with a USB sd/micro-sd adapter.",
"I bought this for a Galaxy Note 8.0, and while it functions properly, it is completely useless for my tablet. I can't put movies or books on it, because they are streamed from Google Play, and i can't put apps on it because that is not allowed. Why do they put a $&@?!$@& micro sd slot on a tablet that can't use it for anything but backups- backups i might add that are already in the cloud. Amazon did a great job delivering it, which was a bright spot in the realization that i spent 25 dollars on a chip that is going to do a better job cleaning the dirt out of my grout than helping the memory on my tablet.",
This might be my 3rd 32 GB disk that I buy from scanDisk.They work for few months and then NOTHING...My tablet wont detect them anymore... my computer wouldn't either.Quite disappointing.,
"No formatting issues here used this for my HTC one MAX and my daughters Galaxy S4 with no problems or crashing or data loss loaded up books, videos and music with tons of space left!",
came quick and works well with my galaxy s4. formating was simple. its a sandisk not much that could be wrong with it.,
Sandisk always do a great job. I have like a year with this memory and works perfects! I recommend it 100%,
I like how this micro SD card is formated.My tablet wont read it though.I dont know whats wrong.,
Love the quality of the Sandisk Ultra Class 10 card. It will be very valuable for storage on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1. Sam,
"Well i'm not a experienced product reviewer when it comes to such memory card kind of thing. Everything seems fine. Delivery time was on time. Writing speed reading speed is normal. I didn't expect adapter would come with it. That's plus 1 star. The only reason i'm giving four star is battery drain of my phone. When I filled this card with almost 15 GBs of music and put it in my phone, my phone's battery was draining very very quickly. Is it supposed to be like this? I'm not sure if it's phone's or this card's faulty. I.ve never been experienced such thing before. So if anyone knows the solution and explanation for this situation I hope U will enlighten me pls. Otherwise this product seems solid and legit.",
"This card is fast! And cheap!  I used it on my Canon S100 Camera to shoot raw format pictures and 1080 video and it worked flawlessly.  I'm currently using it on my old Mytouch phone for storage.Great product, great price.",
"So far so good, this card works fine in my LG Optimus L9. Its been about 5 days, and I've added 20gb's of music on it. I will update if this card fails me in the future.",
I have been using this in my phone for several months.  Still works great. Seems fast however i have not done any real tests.,
"Great product and price from SanDisc.  I will be using it for my cell phone, replacing the 8GB.  For my video now I have 2+ hours with the 32GB (compared to 20 minutes w/8GB) in &#34;super fine&#34; mode.  All the rest of my SanDisc memory card from years ago are still working 100%!  Thanks SanDisc!!!",
My T100 Transformer read the card immediately. Nice and compact storage solution. Does the job and you won't be disappointed.,
"I placed it in my better half's Samsung Galaxy 3 cellphone, and she was blown away with speed her phone now has. She comments on it all of the time. Most of the time, all I hear is &#34;Oh WOW&#34;",
Writes & reads really fast. The card that came with my dash cam would pause about 11 seconds between files. With the Ultra there is only a one second pause. Now I won't be returning the dash cam. Highly recommend!,

"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
"Got this to go with my little E-Prance dash cam.  Had to reformat it to work with camera, but works fine now.  Cost half as much as camera.",
The best MicroSD card around for shooting with goPro black edition.Had enough memory to record all my dives and then some. in 1080 wide settings.Will get more of this lil Giant,
"Bought this for my Android Phone/Tablet - love it, 32GB is a ton of storage and being Class UHS-I it's FAST",
"Good cover love the standing feature, one big flaw.... It need cut outs for the speakers when shut....Music still plays when active and cover closed to protect screen but there are no cut outs for the speakers thus destroying the sound..... This is a huge design flaw for the case.",
"It does the job, found it cheaper after I bought it. Bummer is the first thing that came to mind.",
Worked good in my talbet and gave it more space too do more games and pictures and download too save all your pictures,
I have always trusted SanDisk.  This card works great in the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 2.  I have been using it for about a month.,
"My wife and I both own Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrockets, and I bought these to replace the cheap cards that we originally used in them.  The space is wonderful, and the whole phone seems faster with these cards installed.  Very happy with this purchase.",
I used it with my Gopro and it recorded amazing 1080p videos and long time lapses. No issues with freezing or corrupting HD videos.,
"I use this in the S2, works great, movies, pictures, passworded storage areas, everything is working fine after 6 months! Your mileage may vary, good luck.",
"I am writing this from the perspective of being a long-time experienced Kindle user vs. someone brand new. From an overall perspective, considering the pricing of the Kindle with Special Offers at 79 vs. higher amounts for the different flavors of Kindle available today, this one is a bargain. If you have wanted to get your kids a Kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because 119 to 400+ is a lot of money to risk with a child, maybe at 79 this is your price point.From a size standpoint, the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e-Ink Kindles. It is slightly thicker - but slightly lighter - than the Kindle Paperwhite, but to me it's not really a noticeable difference when you're holding it in a protective cover.Opening up the box, included with the Kindle is a micro-USB cord but no power adapter. That's really annoying. Interestingly, and it seems rather chicken of Amazon, a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for 15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the Kindle (or 20 if you purchase it later), so if you already have a micro-USB charger handy I wouldn't order one of the chargers.There are no page buttons - no buttons at all except for the power button - and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you're reading, or swiping the screen with your finger.Reading is easy on this one: in comparison to my Kindle Keyboard, the previous version of Kindle, and a Kindle DX the letters on the screen are much, much darker and easier to read: the display is crisp and dark.Read more",
"I really enjoy the Amazon Fire TV. I only have trouble locating all of the Amazon Prime movies and tv shows in one grouping. I wish I could stream only the movies and tv shows that is included with my Prime membership. Otherwise, this device works excellent. The install was a breeze. Glad I purchased it.",
Love this SD Card. I have had such great results from it. I could not be happier with it. Love the price I was able to get this for. I have bought them before and will probably buy more. I don't think I will ever buy anything but the ULTRA series sd cards.,
"I have a 4gb and an 8gb micro sd card so I finally had to upgrade since I was getting close to filling up both cards. The micro sd arrived a week before so I do recommend these guys.Update--So for some reason the sd card wants to be dumb and work and not work with my phone (Motorola Razr M). Now I know it's not the phone because it works perfectly fine with the other sd cards I have. I haven't contacted the sellers yet, but probably will soon if it continues to act up.",
"Update on Dec 23 2013 - Please scroll to the very end of this review for 2 month use update. ...For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model. The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080). This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution. The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.Read more",
"This was purchased to capture video with a GoPro Hero3, and so far it has performed splendidly. HD video takes up a ton of space, but this card will still hold quite a bit of it. Downloading is pretty quick and easy thanks to Class 10 speed.",
I normally buy the SanDisk Extreme for my GoPro but decided to try the Ultra to save some money.  So far it seems to work good.  I have not tried to shoot at 4K yet although it seems like it would work.,
"With a little work, this card is an excellent way to inexpensivly upgrade the storage space on your Surface RT or Surface Pro. All you need to do is reformat the card as NTFS and add a virtual hard drive (done in Disk Managment) Once that's done, you have an extra 32GB of space for very little money!",
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes. Normally you pay 150-400+ extra for features that are found in these 100 boxes. I have not found a smart tv that is decent and is also a good value for what you are getting. The advantage is that you can use your TV remote to access the content. (and that is about it)HTPC: These are desktop computers or Mac Minis or Android Sticks that you load software on to stream video to your TV. These can add content that no normal streaming box can access, without giving up quality but they are only recommended for something comfortable with technology that doesn't mind fixing the issues that come up from time to time.Video Game Consoles: Xbox/Playstations can access some of the content that streaming boxes do and have plenty of power to deliver the streams. The downside is the cost (unless you already have one) and the interfaces. These consoles are not designed to stream video exclusively so the interfaces are decent but can be clunky.(You can use other options but frankly they aren't worth the hassle for the amount of hair pulling you would do.)Now this Amazon product has changed everything. It might not be the box for you...but honestly there is a good chance that it SHOULD BE. This is a brand new category for Amazon and they got a lot right, but there are a few shortcomings (at least at launch) as well so read all of this to see what those are.Amazon's Fire TV boxPros:+ Nothing else is this fast. While Roku 3 impressed the world, this raises the bar dramatically. With a quad core processor and 4 times the memory of any other streaming product, it speeds through menus, boots quicker, starts videos quicker and honestly has the muscle to not struggle with higher end resolutions and surround sound like other boxes can do at times. The best way I can explain it, you will have extra hours at the end of the year because this box is THAT much faster.+ Voice search is amazing. It really works. Less using a four directional keypad to enter in titles is a real time saver and makes you wonder why this wasn't done before but it is only for Amazon content and VEVO (music videos) (at least for now). You can not use the voice search with Netflix for example.+ Ready for gaming, well at least once you spend another 40. The 40 gaming controller feels a bit pricy for this type of gaming and really should be 25 or less in my opinion. That being said, this box has real games you would actually want to play instead of a VERY limited selection on Roku 3 but it is not a REAL console at 100 and honestly shouldn't be compared to them.+ Better image quality I know you are thinking I am imagining things or have changed my setup but both myself and my wife have noticed that generally (in different apps) the video is slightly sharper and clearer. We are using the exact same tv, settings, even the same HDMI cable that we used with the Roku 3 until we switched it for the Fire TV box. We have noticed that especially on poor quality feeds that the image quality is noticeably better than under the same feeds with Roku 3. Now I don't know if there is better graphic chips or if the bigger processor can do more tweaking while streaming but it seems to be something. As image quality is a huge deal for most folks (and normally us streamers have to suffer with decent quality) this is certainly worth noting. So far we have noticed this under Netflix, VEVO and Plex.Cons:- It lacks soul. Yes, soul. The Fire TV box and remote are built like a dvd player or appliance--cold, fast, efficient. Unlike Roku 3 where the box seems to have a bit of the personally of TiVo--it feels warmer, more inviting. Everything about this box is business like, including the interface and the lack of options to change it.- The interface is more than merely cold. It is simply less flashy/pretty than the Roku 3 interface. While fast, I am less tempted to wander around like I do on Roku 3. It seems like they are being pretty dependent on the voice search function which is great but it leaves you missing out on the random items you find along the way with the Roku 3 interface. I will update this more upon extended use.- The voice search only works for Amazon's own content (and VEVO) and not most 3rd party channels like Netflix.- The remote is not ready for gaming use, compared to the Roku 3 remote with gaming buttons when you turn the remote sideways and more sensors for detecting movements/motion.- Another feature about the remote I don't care for is the use of Bluetooth instead of WIFI. Roku used to use Bluetooth on their former high end box but instead replaced it with wifi to increase battery life and to add the headphone jack in the remote. It will likely take a few weeks of use to report battery life but this has me concerned.- No headphone jack function like Roku 3. Now to be honest, if you use that on the Roku 3 it can be a battery drain but it is a cool feature.- Missing some popular channels at launch. There is no HBO-Go, no M-Go and no Vudu. In addition, the channel count is much less than Roku's at launch.- Channels operate differently on FireTV than the do on Roku 3. See my notes below for more information.Overall:This Fire TV box took so much from other company's products with only a few missing items. They focused on delivering smooth, fast performance with less frills than Roku 3 for the same price. While there are missing channels and features, the biggest failure for me PERSONALLY is the cost of the gaming controller. Without it, this box isn't ready for gaming but adding 40 more for the ability to try out the functionality seems pretty steep. Had Amazon included it with every Fire TV box, they would have sold a lot more games and had everyone calling the Roku 3 a poor value.If you do not have any streaming box yet, I would HIGHLY recommend this box over every other product on the market right now. I don't make this endorsement lightly. I currently own 3 Roku 3 boxes because I liked them so much, until I used this Fire TV box. This box means Roku will have to really work on improving their product for Roku 4 or they will lose the high end market. (An update, my wife officially asked to replace the Roku 3 boxes with more Fire TV boxes tonight. Yes, these things are that good folks)If you have a Roku 3 box, really look at the missing channels and features--are they something you could give up for faster performance (Also look at my notes on the features of the various common apps.) If the answer is yes, then grab one of these and try it. If no, wait to see if Amazon adds features/channels. At the very least, consider an Fire TV box for your next box.I do not personally recommend Apple TV as they are still too slow and lack too many features and functions. Apple keeps promising something amazing but delivering minor improvements.If you are on a budget and have an Android based tablet, consider Chromecast. It is a good value for the price but you do give up features and content to save on the cost compared to Roku 3 Fire TV.I am giving this box a 4.8 rating, compared to a 4.2 for Roku 3.I will update this review regularly for a while, so check back for more information Also if you have questions or comments, please feel free to ask them in the comments section. Either myself or other helpful people will do our best to respond to them.UPDATE 1:Based on comments, I wanted to add a few points.Regarding comments that I received the item free or are paid by Amazon to write this review, etc.I paid the full list price and local sales tax for this box (grrr). Nothing was provided to me nor was I paid anything to write about this device. I do not work for Amazon, I own my own company. For this item, I am just a customer. In fact, I didn't expect to even purchase a Fire TV prior to it being announced because I figured it would only deal with Amazon's own content which I feel is much weaker than Netflix. In fact, I have talked two different family members into getting Netflix over Amazon's Prime Streaming service in the past month alone.HBO Go:This has been repeated over and over in the comments but HBO Go support for me is not something I am interested in as I do not have cable service anymore nor do I feel that HBO is a better value than Netflix. I would not go without Netflix support at all but I personally think HBO Go is more niche for many people and honestly I bet this device will get that channel before too long. Clearly the HBO Go people seem to be pushing the issue but I know 11 streaming box users and none use HBO Go so while I noted the missing feature above, people still seem to want to beat me up over it.UPDATE 2:CHANNELS:It needs to be said that some channels require cable/satellite subscriptions (to those channels) like HBO Go (not currently on this box), Showtime, ESPN, etc. Even if you have HBO, it does not mean that your provider allows the HBO Go, so look into that before purchasing any box with that in mind. I do like the Bloomberg TV (not available on Roku 3) App which actually features a LIVE TV feature.NETFLIX APP: Is the older style with the tall covers (like VHS boxes) instead of the new Netflix interface that uses short wide covers (like on Roku 3). Netflix has said they are moving everything to the new software but the Fire TV box doesn't have it yet. That makes comparing performance harder from Roku 3 to Fire TV. On my ISP provider Comcast (Netflix recently agreed to pay Comcast so they have faster streams to customers) I do not see a HUGE improvement in performance in buffing like you see on other channels. What it does seem to do is start in better quality and/or speed the improvement in quality. My guess is that the Netflix app needs to be tweaked to maximize the performance of this hardware. One positive with the FireTV app is that it plays the entire TV episode BEFORE switching to a small window with the countdown starting for the next episode. I can't tell you how many times I had to click, click, click and click just to see the end of an episode under Roku 3.Also, the FireTV Netflix app has two features that were removed from the updated Roku app. Before going into a TV show, FireTV tells you how many total episodes that Netflix has. On the Roku it shows you the number of seasons instead. I personally prefer the number of episodes but clearly that is a personal preference. Another point worth mentioning is that the FireTV Netflix App shows you how many items you have in your list and what item number you are on. That information is missing from the Roku 3 Netflix app.AMAZON PRIME CONTENT: Does not loop--a feature they should add (and likely will). This means once you get to the end, it just stops instead of keeping going.VOICE SEARCH:Voice search DOES cover some 3rd party content, despite everyone reporting it works on Amazon's content only. I have repeated confirmed it supports the VEVO app and will find music videos in that app. That may mean that other 3rd party apps are covered as well, or certainly might be able to be in the future. If you search for something that has PRIME content and VEVO content, it will default to the option with the most options. To switch to the other, simply arrow up and either left or right to see the music videos or PRIME search results.OPTICAL OUT:I noticed this box featured an optical out port but normally run everything through my LG TV (via HDMI) and then use an optical out to my receiver (so I never have to change the receiver's settings) so I wasn't excited about this addition to the Fire TV box over my Roku 3 boxes. I stand corrected. I decided to run my audio via the optical cable into the receiver directly from this Fire TV box (something that I can not do with Roku 3) and it fixed all random lip-sync issues I have from time to time on the Roku 3 box (and the same with the HDMI output on this box).Now I know this is not a typical setup for many people but I do know that tons of people have lip-sync issues with HDMI connections so being able to bypass the HDMI minefield is much more important than I expected.VEVO APP:This app works better than the Roku 3 app performance wise...one quick example is that some content simply fails on the Roku 3 app--try watching Britney Spears's Work B**CH (don't make fun of me). Vevo can play this video fine on YouTube and on the Fire TV app but struggles on Roku 3's app. SOME of VEVO's content is also available via VOICE SEARCH too.REMOTE:I do miss the jump back button on the remote that Roku 3 features. It is a tiny thing but it once you are used to jumping back to see that painting in the background or catch that line that you didn't hear because the phone rang, or someone was talking, you feel lost without it. UPDATE They did include this feature but hid it abit. You simply double click the reward button to skip back. I haven't seen anyone else mention this tip so you saw it here first peopleI do like that the enter button is back in the center of the directional keys. This is the way it used to be on Roku boxes before someone at Roku decided to move it below the directional keys, so you have to move your thumb oddly to press it.MULTITASKING:What multitasking you ask Since you haven't seen this advertised or mentioned elsewhere, I can understand your confusion but try this: Load a Pandora stream...then click on the HOME button and browse for movies/tv you want to watch. As long as you are in the Home/Amazon Prime content, you can browse WHILE Pandora continues playing. Now Pandora dies when you enter another APP like Netflix but it shows you that Multitasking is built into the operating system and may be utilized in future features. (Again, this TIP is only found here)Another update: This tip also works when browsing PLEX content before you play something. So even when utilizing a 3rd party app, it can keep going. When it changes to a new song, a small window pops up on the lower right hand side of the screen to tell you know the new song title and artist.PLEX APP:Compared to the Roku app, PLEX for FireTV is totally different. There are some cool features, like the backgrounds, the screensaver using your photos and the MUCH faster menuing (night and day from Roku 3) but I do miss the channels not requiring a couple clicks to switch to ONLINE to see. I do miss that clicking the play button doesn't play a clip, instead you select it (click) and then play it (second click).SCREENSAVER:FireTV has a screensaver that is honestly pretty cool in my opinion. I am not saying you can't do this with other boxes but no other box comes set up to display random photos (and includes a decent amount of beautiful photos as well.) This functionality covers 3rd party apps like Netflix and Plex too so you have a seamless slideshow no matter what you are using when it starts. This is the sort of thing you see on PCs not streaming boxes and it is a nice touch.GAME CHANGING:Many commenters have argued that this device is not gaming changing and many have rating my review not helpful because of that title.I said Nothing else is this fast to which one commenter said, Nobody cares how fast an streaming box is. That's not a game changerActually using it you will see what I mean. This is the first time a company has put so much into creating a very solidly made hardware device. Like a fast computer (which this basically is), it will depend on software that is written for it to fully show off its abilities.When AMD created their first processor that competed directly with Intel's higher end processors, it was a game changer, correct, because it changed the landscape of personal computers forever, lowered pricing, etc.People will look back in 5 years at this moment and say Amazon's FireTV changed how consumer streaming video boxes were made (instead of barely enough processing power to stream, they became able to compete with HTPCs and Mac Minis). This is the beginning of a new generation of streaming boxes.I said Voice search is amazing. and they said Not unique, by any means. My xbox, ps3, tablets, all have this, and all work amazingly.Find one person who owns this that doesn't say this voice search works better than anything from Google, Apple or Microsoft. The fact that little old Amazon could out deliver those tech giants is SHOCKING. The fact this works via a tiny remote makes it very easy to get use to. There is no other product in this price range that does this and no other streaming box even offers it at any cost.I said Ready for gaming, well at least once you spend another 40 to which they said: And stick to basic android games. No thanks. I have a REAL console (or a couple of them) that can play REAL games...This isn't meant to compete with more expensive game consoles. It is meant to bring gaming to streaming boxes, just like tablets/cellphones have brought gaming to millions. They have not replaced gaming consoles (and likely never will) just like this box will not have you ditch your gaming console either but instead it opens you up to tons of games you CAN'T play on that same console. Just imagine all the cheap under 5/free games you can enjoy on your FireTV box. As I said above in my main review, I think Amazon really should have thrown in the controller to really get peopling playing the games but I can understand why they needed to limit their losses.Again, this is a best in class hardware device with real gaming and the best voice search on any tech device (and the only one for a streaming video box). Every future streaming box will be measured against this one. Tell me how that isn't game changingPlease understand that everyone has different priorities and requirements so no one box is going to be perfect for everyone. I am attempting to do my best to address most of the many options and provide a decently balanced opinion of them.Hopefully this review has been helpful to you.

"this item works great but maybe a better price would be better, I use it on my phones works great",
"Good quality SD memory. The speed suggested is true for the Read speed. The write speed is slower, around 15MB/s.",
"Bought this for my HTC Evo 4G LTE, it works great, I knew in order to use such a big card it had to be a Class 10, and I only trust SanDisk, Samsung, or Kingston with my memory cards. This one works well, it did take about a day for the &#34;bugs&#34; to be ironed out and let the Evo find its paths back to its files. This is a very good stick at a very good price. The first one I got from Amazon was damaged, they quickly replaced it..... with one that was lost by FedEx!!!! I called up about a week later and they overnighted a new one, and paid for weekend UPS delivery! I was amazed at the service from Amazon on this.All-in-all, it doesn't get much better than SanDisk for memory, and Amazon for the place of purchase. Don't hesitate to buy this card for your HIGH END phone. I know for a fact that the HTC Evo LTE & Galaxy S3 can run this card.",
"I got this to use with the HP Slate 7- EXTREME (even though that device is supposed to only use 32 GB), I formatted it FAT32 and 'mounted' it, and it works great...",
THE NAME OF ITSELF SPEAKS OUT. GO SANDISK GO!,
Always have multiple shots at your dataI lost some photos due to a corrupt cardI used this for my phoneThe company did replace my card with no problemsBeen working great for the past few months,
Does exactly what it's designed to do.  I'm looking forward to transferring it from the phone to my new camera on an as-needed basis.,
Works real good in my Galaxy S4 phone and Galaxy tablet. Very good price as it can cost above 60 dollars in retail stores.,
I can't believe how much info you can fit on this little card. The transfer speeds are unbelievable. My phone camera is now always in burst mode because it copies the file so quickly.,
"Used for a digital camera card.Read speeds tested acceptable on a laptop using the adapter (11mb/s)WRITE speeds were atrocious reading 1mb/s to 512kb/s.The write speeds are not good for a card that needs to write files such as pictures or hd video.I have taken a few photos and tested the video, Perhaps the camera is capable of using this card at a better rated speed than the laptop and adapter",
I can use this in in a variety of devices with the included adapter. Seems to work great and seems to me to be very fast. Good value for the money.,
"It may be that the internal SD slot of the 2012 Mac Book Air is not too fast perhaps?  I am very disappointed that I can only achieve 4-9 MB/s of write/read speed.  Makes me remember speeds of 5 years ago.  Again, this may be the computer's fault, but I am not too happy...",
Works well in my Droid RAZR MAX. Allows plentry of space to move videos & pictures to card for later transfer to computer.,
Inserted the memory card in my Galaxy S4 phone and it immediately recognized it. Can you ask for anything more?!,
I prefer the San Disk brand over other types.  This is a great size for phones & camera's.  I would buy again.,
I've never had a problem with SanDisk products.  Just make sure your camera or device can actually use 32GB -- some are limited to 16GB.,
Great price. Fast speed class 10. with adapter. I like the color. It's a memory card not much to go wrong.,
just wanted extra space on my tablet and this sd works just fine for what the job i needed it for,
I got this SD Card for my phone. Works well. No issues. It was cheap and exactly what I needed.,
"I LOVE this!!!! Although it doesn't show color, (which is about the only thing I don't love about it) it is still very cool. I got it when I was 9, back in 2015, and loved it! It doesn't show ads, which I really love, since does ANYONE like those pesky ads Very good product, and totally worth your money.",
This card is both small and large at the same time. It's micro size but high capacity are perfect and works well with my GoPrc Hero 3. Recording in 1080p is not an issue either. THe class 10 rating allows the GoPro to do its thing and the card is able to keep up with the high MB transfer rate.,
I bought this because it was super cheap on black Friday or cyber Monday week ( whatever that means ) . It is great. I bought it thinking that it might be better in my Galaxy s2 but I have not noticed any difference in speed. I guess it is more for HD video recording or picture taking in a camera.,
"Love it, now i have 118GB in my zte supreme, works really well in my phone, it restarted my phone a few times when i first put it in but no problems after that, no idea why it did that, but now i can fit my entire music collection on my android which has reached 94GB of all rock and metal!!!!!!!!!!!! now i can get rid of that damn ugly ass ipod classic!!!",

"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",
"Works perfect in my note 3. This card even writes almost as fast as my internal phone storage! It works much better than cheap Chinese cards. I've also tried it in my go pro, and it has plenty of write speed, even enough for shooting in 4K! I highly recommend it, and will definitely be getting another soon.",
"The storage works for my phone but when you install the storage into the SD adapter, my computer doesn't read the data.",
Superb! No complains what so ever. I bought this for my Galaxy S4.Pros.-Speed!!!-Comes with the adapter-Lifetime warrantyCons.-None.,
"I bought this memory card the day I received my Samsung Galaxy S4. It arrived in two days via Prime, plugged it in and formatted. It offers 59.45 GBs of usable space. Being that the card is Class 10, reads are super fast and writes are great. UHS-1 is, sadly, mostly only supported by DSLRs, so most smartphones and devices won't take advantage of the super, super speed, but nonetheless, the card is fast.This card has lots of storage, affordable, transfers and reads fast. I'd recommend this for people who carry a lot of media, such as music and videos.",
This is my second fire and case. I love both even though I have not dropped my device I feel confident with the thick foam surrounding it would survive if I did.,
"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list for apps, much less so. 90 of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7 tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download Casablanca but not able to download The Avengers even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HDDisplay: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 vs. 7.6 x 5.4 x 0.4). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9 version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special reading mode to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive (229 vs. 199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a 20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is 10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The Recommended for you display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule Quiet Time on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7 HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8 iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9 x 4.5 x 0.34 and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87 x 5.3 x 0.29 and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX 11 hours (17 hours when reading) Nexus 9 hours iPad Mini 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only 139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at 229 vs. 399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. 90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.

"A good memory card, no actually a great memory card!  I use it in my Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  I have quite a lot of music and pictures on the card and there is no lag or delay when I'm going from one song to the next.  And my pictures display quickly.  I'm glad I got the 64gb card because even though I have a lot of media on the card, I still have space for more.  The price for the card is really nice also.  A good buy",
"It's a storage device - a very small one physically, but it holds a lot. Great to add capacity to a tablet or cell.  This one does what it is supposed to do. It stores files in various formats. What more to ask for? A lower price I suppose. If you can wait a year, you'll doubtless have that.",
"Works as expected, no glitches or problems. Using it with my Contour Roam2 helmet camera. Frustration free packaging was nice.",
"I have had the 32gb in my Galaxy S3 for almost three months and there were no issues. However, the phone just recently started telling me the card has unrecognized files or it is empty, causing the loss of my media. I chose to format it after seeing the error for too long, chalking it up to some random error. Somehow, yesterday, all of the files on my card magically reappeared and I was able to play my music again, despite having had the phone format the card. Shortly afterwards, the error reappeared. I put the card in my computer and it is simply not appearing. Shame, but I think this is a risky card to purchase.",
After exactly month and a half this card is done...and with it i lost all my pics and videos...just after the return policy expired!! card is not recognized by my phone or PC. Trying to get RMA from Sandisk...I own the S3 and have read extensive problems with the 32 and 64gb card class 10! Samsung says is Sandisk...and Sandisk says is the phone ??? But i've seen other cards failing with different phones! All Android by the way...What's the problem ?,
"Plenty of extra storage can load a lot of movies in high definition, music and a boat load of other stuff.",

Love it I bought it for my mother and father she is easy for them to use and they are in there 70s,
"I read all reviews about the tap so I decided to try it, I love it. The tap keeps me up to date with weather, news etc. I use it every day.",
"First two order of this item were fails. They both failed around six months of use. However, Sandisk honored their warranty and completely replaced the items. Still using it, and pretty happy.",
"I would give these a 5th star if the memory  had consistent read/write times per card.I'm not saying they aren't fast,  but they all should stay within the rated speed they've been tested for, especially when in a USB 3.0 card  reader! After they have been used several times their speed decreases to below the threshold,  of the Standard set for these chips.",
"Price of micro SD per GB is much lower compared to a few years ago.Works fine with LG G2x and Galaxy Note 2.With all the new phones with more than 6M pixels and 1080p video, your internal storage is going to dry out very fast. External Micro SD is definitely a must.4GB and 8 GB are running out very fast :(. 32GB is definitely a welcome (especially if you buy it during the sale)Pro:1. Bought this during sale - under 25 USD.2. Class 10 - fastest (for now)3. Trusted brand: SanDiskCons:None.",
"I bought this for my Lumia 1520 Windows Phone to supplement the onboard storage capacity. Fits fine, works great, fast access, immediately recognized by the device. Not much more you can ask of a microSD card.",
"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysOctober 11, 2013Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound, and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD. As you correctly point out, the new Kindle Fire HD is the successor to last year's entry level Kindle Fire, which does not include features such as camera, microphone, or HDMI port. You are also correct to point out that this device does not support Mayday, although there are still multiple ways to get help for free directly from your device. We hope you enjoy the new features and services. Thanks, The Kindle Team",
"great card, haven't had one crash yet.  for $20 you can't go wrong with the 32 gb sandisk memory card.",
"Works as I expected with ScanDisk. Installed and formatted in my Samsung galaxy note 3 with no issues. Once in the phone, the real amount of usable space is only 59GB just for reference.",
"I'm glad these are red and grey and not all black to be honest.  After dropping a black one in the grass the other night.  Spent 20 minutes searching a 9 sq foot area!  Seriously they need to not ever make removable storage smaller than these things.Other than that..it works great, no problems whatsoever.  If you need to reformat, it's suggested you use the sd formatting tool from the SD Association, of which SanDisk is a permanent member.  Windows doesn't exactly follow the specification, though for most uses windows format will work too.Here's the funny part.  This is about $2 more than the 32GB SanDisk class 4 card.  I've been waiting for those cards to drop in price as faster speeds take over...but they don't drop in price.  And thanks to the newegg free shipping on items over $25, it's actually cheaper overall when you order the $25 class 10 card and get free shipping instead of the $23 class 4 card plus $8.75 shipping.",
I returned it because I wanted better sound...opted for a bose soundlink. Decent speaker with nice amazon prime/Alexa features...just not the sound I was looking for.,
"I bought my stepdaughter a Galaxy phone, and I didnt want to spend the extra money to upgrade her phone from 16gb. This was cheap and works fine.",
"Super fast, works great on my Samsung S4. Had to make a few config changes on the S4 but that's not the card's problem :)",
"Ayyy what can you say. It works. It used to have a delay for my phone recognizing it and all the data on it, but that may be a phone problem. Got it for $42.99 on black friday. Can't knock it at all. *****FIVE STARS*****",
I have a galaxy note II and after rooting I now have 64gb internal memory and this card is super fast. Can't ask for any better except for larger capacity because performance is great.,
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
"Fits well, the easel stand is a little flimsy and the Cobalt Purple is really blue, but for protection it works well.",
I tried using the non-ultra models.  After one year one of the two stopped working completely (used in a Galaxy S3 phone).  We switched that one out for one of these a few months ago.  No issues.  Speed is more reliable also.  Highly recommended.,
"it's 128gb, what more needs to be said?  I stuck it in my Surface Pro as additional storage space and it does just that, no problems.",
It works fine in my Verizon Galaxy S3 but has to be formated to FAT32.  Also works in my Canon IXUS 80.,
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
"I bought two of these for my laptop and my camera and they're working great so far, good speed. 100% happy with this purchase.",
Works GREAT on the Dell Venue 11 Pro tablet. I now have double the space.  Can store over 50 full length movies.,
Very happy with the Tap. We have the Echo and would have to unplug it and plug it in to use it on the deck. With the Tap we just take it off the charging stand and go. No more bothering with Bluetooth speakers and using our phone when we can just play music ever from the Internet with TAP.,
I really wouldn't know how to rate a chip except to say that it works.  It is obviously slower than a USB 3.0 flash drive but it is working well in my Asus T100.  I use it as my D:\drive for all data and scripts.,
Works perfectly in my Samsung tablet!,
As usual anything from San Dish is a quality product.  Bought to use with my Surface Pro.  Works as described and fast connection.,
I purchased a Car-Cam from Amazon and it was recommended from another reviewer to purchase a 32GB Class 10 Card USB memory card and I'm glad I followed the recommendation.  Before I received this card I had already received the Cam so I thought I would try my other card from my tablet.  NOT; the Cam wouldn't recognize the card.  Being a Class 10 is a better quality and will work with most devices.,
What I needed - good price ! I am using this for my s3 and it works well. Takes pictures in an instant.,
"I am 67 and the only problem I have with my kindle is that it seems to have grafted itself to my hand. I am having trouble putting it down to do things like clean the house, do dishes, wash clothes. It works great and I really love the game plants vs zombies.I love that it came with the wall charger.",
"Bought this on Deal of the Day which surprised me since it is new to Best Buy. Just push the button and ask ""her"" to do something such as play favorite radio station or music from play list. Have ""her"" set timers and alarms to wake by. I haven't used half of the features of TAP. The sound is amazingly great for such a small device.",
it works as expected. I should have sprung for the higher capacity.  I think its made a bit cheesier than the earlier versions; the paint looks not as clean as before,
"Everyone need now how you camera, GPS, phone or other gadget can go faster wit a real high speed memory, sometimes we think for example that camera is very slow to recover or open a photo, the GPS spend a lot of time charging a route or your phone game think a lot, using a fast memory reduces a lot all time and battery because the gadget no need spend time charging files.",
"I had bought the 32GB card here on sale.  It ran great for the first 4 months.  This afternoon it unmounted from my Samsung SGS III.  I powered the phone down, re-seated the card, powered up and it was still not recognized. Powered back down, pulled the card and popped it into the computer and it showed a single partition of 0 bytes. Mounted the card back into the phone and booted into recovery (my phone is rooted with CWM), where I double checked that it could not be mounted or formatted. I then tried to re-partition the card but no luck. Phone is back up and running fine on a spare 8GB card so no problems there.  It doesn't matter how good or how fast the card is if it dies this quickly. I had most of my stuff backed up so no major loss, but I am out the cost of the card...",
Great item. Runs a lot faster then the cheap ones and still a really good price. Worth the extra money,
"works perfectly well with my Galaxy s4! before use, i put the micro sd card into the adapter and put it into my laptop, connected my phone to my laptop, transfered all my stuff from one sd card to the other, and it worked well, i still have all my stuff... with PLENTY of room to spare... and now with the S4 you can save your apps onto ur sd card, so whatever i can save on my sd card instead of the actual phone memory, i save... now both have a lot of free memory =] very happy with this purchase. have had it for a while now.",
"Horrible screen. Nice on one side, totally different color on the other.",
"Using this in my Galaxy S4 and it works fairly well. I've transfered a bunch of files from the PC via a usb 3.0 memory card reader and ya know, it's not blazing fast but it's pretty good for what it is. It's certainly a lot more tolerable than pretty much any other microSD card I've used.That said, you get a minimum write speed that's good enough for 1080p video on a cell phone or other mobile device and will probably lead to faster times between shots if you use it in a camera phone, if for no other reason than it takes less time to write the picture you just took to the disk vs say a cheaper sd card.It's a microSD card, I haven't had any problems. Go for it.",

The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
"Works great with both models of DashCam I purchased.The Blackvue Dr400G-HD and DR500GW-HD.32GB works wonders for a constantly on dash cam,",
"It does what it says it will do - unlike most people I know.It also handles very cold temperatures well, too.",
"I love everything about this case except for how it fits on the Echo Dot. I was expecting a snug fit however, it is very lose and so you have to make sure that if you pick it up to move it (and the power cable is disconnected), the dot will fall out of the case.",
This is my favorite memory card brand. I have mani more in other devices. Also very reliable for keep&iacute;ng your data safe,
Tap is a nice bluetooth/wifi speaker that is portable and can give you information when you ask it questions.Can Sync with your phone via using the Amazon Alexa app.,
I liked it as it was a great price and the size was the major factor... Not too big and bulky compared to others.,
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
"I put this in my Samsung Skyrocket phone.  Even though the phone says 32 GB  max, it still recognized and formatted the card.  Its great to have all of that space.However, any time i try to use the USB mass storage mode to transfer files, it errors out.  I thought it was the phone since it was larger than the max spec, but then I tried it in a USB card reader I had.  It still errored out trying the same files.  Finally, I had to put it in the adapter, and stick it in a card reader built into a laptop and transfer the files that way.I think the issue was that using the USB 2.0 the files were writing too fast and faulting out and with the laptop, transferring the files from the wireless network and then to the card, the transfer speed was slow enough that it was successful.  Took all night to get my stuff on the card though.I use it mostly for pics and video on my phone also, works great.  The phone seems to have no trouble accessing anything on the card and it seems  plenty fast for it even when recording high def video which i do a lot of for work.",

I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out.

"Bought this for my Epic 4g touch, great card and great price. I store tons of pictures and music on it and still have plenty room.",
Works great. Only problem is that if i put the card in a multi car reader it does not read the car. Has to be put in a SD CARD ONLY reader to work and be read by computer,
"I bought this to go along with a nifty minidrive pro, and have not been disappointed. It really holds the full 128, and the data transfer speeds are great. I used it to keep all of the media from my itunes library, and have not had any issues with playback or lag. I really recommend this if you want to add a quick 128 to your MBP.",
"I use this in my Galaxy S3 so that I can carry all my MP3s that are on my iPOD classic (45GB).The only complaint I have is not with this unit, but with smartphones in general.  They are still to sensitive to be used as a true mp3 player replacement.  If you are not too careful, you may crack the screen on your phone if you try to use it as an all-purpose media player.My ipod classic is five years old and it has yet to have its screen crack on me.

This is the best Class 10 MicroSD card I own. I have compared it to my other cards and it out performs all other cards I have. It came with a SD to microSD card converter which is a nice plus. This card come pre-formatted to work with Android devices and Windows devices. Can't get much easier than that.Great card + fast shipping = no complaints,
"Thus microSD card worked fine for a year in my Samsumg Note II. I mostly used it to listed to downloaded music from Spotify. It has actually failed &#34;twice&#34;. When it failed the first time (the phone couldn't &#34;see&#34; that I had a card installed) I thought maybe something had merely corrupted it, so I formatted it, put it back in my phone, and re-downloaded all my playlists. It worked for two months and then failed again. I don't plan to try formatting it again, I'll switch to a different brand of card.",
Really fast processing speeds and saves crystal clear footage. Haven't had any problems with it and don't expect to have any.,
Works well in my phone and gives me a decent amount of storage for a good price. I'd recommend it.,
"Nice sound for the money, good highs not much lows",
"The only thing better doesn't exist yet, just be sure to get the U1 marked model as others are slower bins.",
"I was pleasantly surprised that my card arrived ahead of schedule. That's always a plus in my book. The works without a hitch. I was able to copy the files from my 16GB card to this one relatively quickly and very easily. My Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 read the card perfectly. I have no complaints about the card although I expected the write speed to be a little faster. After all is said and done I would definitely recommend this card for your tablet, smart phone, or any other device that allows for expandable memory.",
"Works great. What more do you want. Versatile, small, and a lot of memory. I use it with multiple camera's and sound recording devices.",
"Great sound, it needs to be a little more sophisticated in responding to inputs. For example, yesterday I told it to play Mexican music -- didn't know any, same with Mariachi Music. Could not play any, Odd,",
"This new KFHD replaces last year's basic Kindle Fire. Although it has some cool new features, it lacks a camera, microphone, and HDMI port. For this reason, I'm glad I kept my 2012 model since it does have these 3 features! Here are my initial impressions of the 2013 Kindle Fire HD: I like the placement of the on/off volume buttons. Being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one. I never cared for the carousel (this is what you see when you turn your Kindle on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed), and now there's an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead, and the apps/books can be rearranged to your liking. I was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar (which is now being called home). I don't know why Amazon removed this option, and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel. But you can still bookmark your favorite web pages YouTube videos for easy access. When I play songs purchased from Amazon's MP 3 store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style. Nice feature, but it doesn't work on every song. This device has a cool new feature called Quick Switch, which allows us, when reading or using an app, to bring up recently accessed items with a swipe instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one.In terms of sound, I find it to be tinny and not as rich as it is on the original KFHD. But you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds. Ironically, music sounds muffled unless you hold the device in landscape mode with your hands covering the speakers. Holding it this way projects the sound out to you.Read more",

"First off,i appreciate you reading this review :) Just so you get a little background on me, we are major tech users. We have multiple tablets from apple,samsung,and asus. This fire tablet is comparable in a different way. This tablet uses a amazon based operating system, Fire os. So no play store or itunes... As a prime member however, this tablet is an incredible value because you get instant access to all of your prime benifits. Ive had a chance to really put this product thru its paces over the past 2 days. I ordered 2 of these tablets so me and my wife could really put these to use. We have Gone thru 3 full power cycles (fully charging and fully draining the battery thru use) it does get 10-11 hours of hefty use so battery life is a plus! This tablet is a keeper. Screen looks fantastic. Colors seem to be just slightly dull however the resoloution for everyday use is perfect for this price point. Speed is snappy enough for basic use and handles more complex tasks and games without much issue. On a passmark benchmark test i got a score of 3377. However the second HD 8 constantly grades about 30-35 points lower. So it is a possibility that even tho you have the same exact tablet,they might be built slightly different so performance will vary. At this price point I didnt expect them to come out exactly the same. This tablet is bassically the same specs as the samsung tab a at half the price! Oh and the hd 8 actually offers a slightly better resoloution then the samsung! Minus one star for the wifi connection. I have lost connection several times on both tablets. Seems to only happen on my 5g connection.Also the screen being so reflective,it is impossible to use at all outdoors.also sadly is a fingerprint magnet.Read more",

"I keep growing with these things as they grow in capacity and speed. This device, however, stands out above all the others microSD Cards I have used. I experienced an incredible and noticeable difference in speed between this and theSanDisk 32GB microSDHC Memory Card (Bulk Package)I have used in my phone for the last two years. Besides doubling the capacity from 32GB, I am enjoying the benefit of the speed this thing brings with it and adds to my phone. The price was really right for this too. I can only imagine what theSanDisk Extreme 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQX-064G-U46A)is like. I was not yet willing to pay the price for it to find out.",
"i was reading some reviews about this and honestly i really don't notice the speed. but the storage of it is epic. 64gb card +32gb phone = ... a lot of information.... and i save and store alot of things. For me its a great card to hold stuff and a speed i really don't noticed, However i want to add that this card is not slow i just don't notice the difference using a 32gb class4 vs 64gb class10 on a e890(optimums g PRO)",
No issues it works great in my device. I don't think it would require more words but I'll type them since it's required.,
"While all Sandisks products are excellent, this is apex.  However, use some caution....not every smartphone, tablet, camera or other digital appliance can or will accommodate the capacity or speed of this product....just make sure yours does, and if it does have no regrets....you're using the best....then watch how well that phone, tablet or camera performs!",

"This is the best micro memory for an android phone! It's very fast running as fast as 38mb/s. The 30gb was a splurge but if you have movies or videos on your phone than this is perfect! Amazing product!P. S. Do not get the ultra mobile version of this, it's slower than this one",
"This provides plenty of storage capacity for your tablet and mobile devices - I've put this into all my cellphones and Android tablets. After twelve months of use, downloading music, videos, apps - there is plenty of room left.The class 10 version is also great for phone/tablet cameras as well for a stand alone camera (yes I still use a digital camera - so yesterday). This is a must for HD action video camera/recorder as well. The price continues to drop so it is very affordable now - unless your device can take the 64Gb version - I'd go with the higher capacity for video recording devices.",
"This Micro SD card is perfect for any smartphone user looking to expand the storage on their device. I personally am using one in my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Works like a charm. It is adequately fast, cheap, and fairly reliable. If you are looking for extremely fast speeds however, you should consider the SanDisk Extreme series which are the fastest MicroSD cards in the world. My card came with an adapter that this card plugs into and it becomes a full sized SD card. If you are looking to use this in a camera or any other device that uses SD cards, please look elsewhere. These cards are not nearly as fast as the full sized SD cards used in cameras. The adapter should only be used for transporting data from the phone or other device, to a computer. All in all, these are a great buy for any smartphone user looking for a higher storage capacity. The price fluctuates often, so catch em while there cheep! I got mine for around $30.",
Is there any thing else that needs to be said?This was put into a Samsung S3. The card worked and has worked so far w/o any hick-ups. Price was very good too here on amazon.,
We often to forget the complexity of technology that we use every day.  That is surely the case with purchased memory.  One manufacturer that has never let me down is SanDisk.  I've used it often (not exclusively) and found it to be reliable quite speedy.,
"I needed a bit more storage in my Galaxy Note II, this has worked perfectly.  I have not run into any problems, other than finding out that my phone does not allow moving applications to the card due to limitations that have been added to the newer versions of Android",
"Since my Samsung S2 could not take the 64GB card, I bought this one. Like I expected it works great and no problems so far.",
It is amazing how much you can hold on such a tiny disc.  Technology is amazing and this is way cheaper than in the stores.,
"I needed this for my phone. I listen to a lot of music and 32 GB's is not enough. It took me a while to get it to work since my phone is older and not capable of working with Ex-Fat, but once I got that straightened out, it's worked great.",

"I use SanDisk Ultra SDHC cards for photo and video and have always been satisfied. When it came to needing a MicroSDHC for a GoPro, I purchased this card. It provides the same reliability, consistency and workflow as the larger SDHC cards and with the included adapter, it easily installs in my current SDHC card reader. It also means I can use it as a back up for my SDHC cards, should the need arise, giving an extra 32 GB as a spare card. Good card at a good price.",

The problems is only with the 64gb version, from what I read the 32gb and lower versions are ok...",

"We ditched cable two years ago and live on Netflix and Amazon Prime. The Fire TV is for our second TV. It setup fast, though I was disappointed that it spent five minutes updating initially. The intro was fast, professional and showed the basic features.We currently use a Sony Blu Ray Player for our primary TV. The Fire TV is much faster to key through screens and items. The antenna for the wifi is superior, connecting our upstairs TV to the downstairs wireless router. The Fire TV starts streaming content instantly, no boot up time.We are very happy to add this streaming device to our home.",
got this to expand my memory in my Samsung tablet  it increased my ability to store more photos.  good purchase,
Plugged into my new Surface Pro and works great!  No issues or hassle.  Good price and low cost for adding additional storage.,
Installation on my Surface was simple and added a lot more storage to my tablet. I liked the SD adapter so that I can use it like a mini USB drive from my larger PC.,

"this is my 3rd sandisk micro sd card for my 3rd android device, and just like its predecessors, the Ultra 64gb micro SDXC class 10 worked flawlessly in my SCH-I605 Samsung Galaxy Note 2.i simply inserted the card, power-cycled the device, and once rebooted, the Note 2 recognized an unformatted sd card and asked if i would like for it to be formatted in order to be read. once i chose YES, i now had an additional, fully usable micro sd card that i use for media and ebook reading storage.the response time is excellent, so i have no complaints on performance.i also love the fact that i ordered this at 3pm on Thanksgiving day when i was alerted of the $39.99 price tag.",
"I thought every app could be transferred into the sd card but no. The description said that I would speed up the device a little but I think it got slower, I have samsung device and its not faster at all and not improving it also. I love this sd card I realy do RECOMMEND IT. But there are some pitty partsnto it. Still love it~~",
It could just be my phone a Galaxy S3 but I have this MicroSD card in my phone and a 32 gb microcenter version in my wife's phone and the 32 th version benchmarks faster than this card. Not by much but it is slightly faster. Again this could just be my phone. One thing I do have a problem with is the fit of the microSD card in the holder/adapter. It is a very tight fit. If I put the card in a different holder/adapter it slides in and out with out problem. The one it came with really holds onto the card.,
"Before doing research, i assumed this card would support my brand new Hero 3 camera... considering it was sold off the Gopro site, it was a no brainer... or so i thought.Anyhow, the card seems to preform well under most circumstances WITHOUT using the Protunes settings. (The problems with the Hero 3 where due to the slow write speed of this card under Protunes settings, without this setting the Hero works fine)However, after a few timelapse issues (2 - 5 sec timelapse, which is well in this card's speeds).I noticed the card is corrupt. I tested this in other cameras and found that this problem still persists. I trust Sandisk as my top choice for all my professional work, however this card has failed!I would not recommend this EXPENSIVE card, id jump for a Samsung, or even the Transcend cards. They even come with a better warranty then this card.Nothing but problems and lost memories that i cant replace....",
Great product with a ton of features. Add the Echo Dot to get even more out of it,
I have owned and used this in my Galaxy SIII for a few months now.  I have never had any problems with it.  It is fast.  I never even think about running out of space on my phone now.  It shows up as 29.71 GB total capacity and I still have 22.86 GB left.,
"Other than a few for cell phones over the years, this is the first time I've used MicroSD cards in an actual camera.  I'm very impressed.  It seems to be just as fast, durable, and dependable as the full sized cards that I've been using for years.  Amazing.",
"SO I recently got a new Chinese brand Android phone (Inew i4000): Quadcore, 13mp camera, 1GB ram, 16Gb internal storage + MicroSD Support. Also comes with App2SD software support as well.I had an old Samsung Class 10 32GB and tested that it works with the i4000. But wasn't enough for a Power-user like me.Decided to give it the extra storage BOOST!With the Sandisk 64GB Class 10, I now hold within:11GB Music Collection (MP3's at ~192 KBPS)20GB of Graphic Novels/Manga/ManwhaBooks with a Manga App/reader2GB of Apps (migrate the Core apps from internal storage to External storage)8GB of Photos taken with the Phone (uses MicroSD as storage for photos)~30GB of free space left for downloading Movies/MP3s/and documents on-the-goI love this little card, its fantastic and a great way to add some serious expandable storage onto any Smartphone that supports the storage.FYI, I had to format the Sandisk 64GB card using my Smartphone (i4000) in order for it to set the microSD to FAT32. DON'T use the PC/laptop to do the format, it will mess it up.Was debating between Class 10 Sandisk 64GB or Class 10 Samsung 64GB, I decided to throw my lot in with the 6000+ reviews for sandisk with an average customer rating of 4.9 Stars.

"Big card, a lot faster than the card that came with my phone. Allows me to switch to video and take pics faster. If you are going to get a cloud storage program think about just getting a couple big cards instead makes downloading and accessing chunks of data a lot easier.",
There's no way I can give this a bad rating because it does exactly what it's supposed to do andthat's espand the memory. I hve been using ScanDisk memory cards for a long time and I have never been disappointed. The apps for tablet are automatically downloaded to the memory card and I have had no issues or complaints.,
"This is great!  This is why I don't buy Apple products and get charged up the @$$ for non-expandable memory.  Expandable memory is dirt cheap these days for how much you get and it's more reliable than Apple.  Works like a charm.  I've got two of these, one in  my phone and one in my tablet, and I've never had any problem or inconvenience with either of them.",
I use these for local backup (I have 2 for redundancy). I've had no problems on any of my systems.,
"I am updating my review from two months ago.. My initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. Today I have been using the Tap and sling daily for over the last two months and I felt like I needed to modify my review. I originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, I am changing my recommendation.The truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. I have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. I think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. Also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.I initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as I thought it would be. I just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.My only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. I am increasing my stars by one. Really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. I have come to really like the sling. I have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. That has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.My original is below. Overall, I would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the Tap.Received the Tap and the Sling cover in the last 24 hours.Read more",
"I had to format it as FAT32, you can google for how to do that, but once you do, it works great.  I'll never understand why people would ever buy a phone that doesn't have a microSD slot.  With this you can fill it up with whatever you want, such as movies, TV shows, music, and share it with whoever you want.  Just pop it in your phone and you are all set for a long trip, airplane ride, etc.  I never need to worry about running out of space when taking full HD videos either.",
The speaker sounds very decent for the size and cost but my favorite thing about the speaker is it is wireless and portable. I can charge the speaker and practically take it anywhere without having to plug it in.,
this works just exactly the same as others listed for 2 times the prices. Thank you for offering it at this price.,

"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",

The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed.

This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV.

Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added.

The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080). This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution. The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.Read more",
Product arrived on time not excessively packaged. Worked perfectly out of the box. Speed is excellent as I can play movies on it and the large file transfer time is very quick on the tablet.,
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",

"First day with the echo show. I'm pretty pleased with it. Some observations that I think have not been hit in most reviews:* Sound quality seems similar to that of the Echo cylinder. Good for a desktop listening experience, not impressive if you want to fill a room with sound.* The Show does have an ambient light sensor (using the camera) so that the screen dims as the room lighting goes down. When I darkened the room at night to work at my PC, the Show display dimmed to the point where I could just make out the time, and not the background photo at all.* Much has been made of the Show displaying lyrics when playing Prime music. That doesn't appeal to me, but when playing music from Spotify, Pandora, and My Music on Amazon, the Show displays the song title, artist name, album art, and a progress indicator. That's really nice when listening to playlists - I was always asking my Echo cylinder Alexa, what's that song* Alexa has always been weak at recognizing the names of some of my Pandora channels. With the show, if Alexa doesn't recognize the name, I can ask it to display my Pandora channels and select them fro mthe Show touch screen, It's good to have a fallback that does not require me to pull out my phone and fire up the Alexa app, then work my way through multiple screens to get my selection.* Some newsfeeds are now accompanied by appropriate photographs.* You can set the Show to use an album from Amazon Prime Photos as a slideshow when the device is inactive. AFAIK, other photo servers cannot be used.",

"I don't want to write a review for each of the 8, 16, 32, and 64 GB SanDisk MicroSDHC Class 10 Cards. They're all 5 stars. They're extremely fast, and as Class 10s, have allowed my Canon SX50's shutter to speed up because it transfers information so quickly with the camera's very small processor. They also allow a burst mode of 9-13 fps which is amazing for a non-DSLR.These cards are also very reliable. I've had no read/write failures in the two years that I've been using them.The one &#34;negative&#34; is that they're so small and can be dropped easily when getting them out of the adapter. Still, if you've been working with computers since there was a gerbil running the power for your PC, you have to marvel at how anything this small can hold more than 30,000 high def 6 GB photos on a 64 GB card that is smaller than your pinky nail.",

"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",

"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",

"This new KFHD replaces last year's basic Kindle Fire. Although it has some cool new features, it lacks a camera, microphone, and HDMI port. For this reason, I'm glad I kept my 2012 model since it does have these 3 features! Here are my initial impressions of the 2013 Kindle Fire HD: I like the placement of the on/off volume buttons. Being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one. I never cared for the carousel (this is what you see when you turn your Kindle on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed), and now there's an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead, and the apps/books can be rearranged to your liking. I was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar (which is now being called home). I don't know why Amazon removed this option, and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel. But you can still bookmark your favorite web pages YouTube videos for easy access. When I play songs purchased from Amazon's MP 3 store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style. Nice feature, but it doesn't work on every song. This device has a cool new feature called Quick Switch, which allows us, when reading or using an app, to bring up recently accessed items with a swipe instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one.In terms of sound, I find it to be tinny and not as rich as it is on the original KFHD. But you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds. Ironically, music sounds muffled unless you hold the device in landscape mode with your hands covering the speakers. Holding it this way projects the sound out to you.Read more",

"I am a prime member. This was my first purchase of Echo and I gave it to my mom who did not want it or think she needed it, haha I purchased Echo dot for 2 reasons, 1) I had wanted the original echo but thought the near 200 price tag was too steep so this price was perfect and 2) I wanted to get something for my mom that would open her mind to the power of technology and the need for change because ultimately I want her to have amazon fire tv because her monthly cable bill is insanely high but she has always been resistant to change. She had no wifi in her bedroom but I resolved that when I purchased TP Link AV500 Wi Fi Range Extender, Powerline Edition which did what no other wifi extender I purchased in past could do, gave my mom's room a secure wifi connection apparently using already existing phone lines. All I know is that she now has wifi in her room. So I got Echo as a way to test her wifi connection with something cool. I easily connected Echo to TP-Link and it worked. We asked Alexa a few basic questions, We laughed a little but then I had to leave. When I returned the next day, I walked in and there was music playing (oldies but goodies) and I walked into my moms room and she was singing but was emotional. I asked her if everything was ok. She was in awe. She was happy. She was emotional because Alexa helped mom find songs at a blink of an eye that mom had not heard since her childhood and she demonstrated it to me. The speed that Alexa found the song and played it was mind-boggling. Mom was also planning a dinner in August and needed to know what day of week it was. She would normally need to leave her room and go to her main calender in the kitchen and find the date. But this time she just asked Alexa who gave her the information in like 2 seconds lol.Read more",

"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",

"I hate it, it worked fine for 2 months and the after those 2 months it started with problems, first, every once and a while was not recognized by my device, and now 4 months after, I have to pull it out and then place it again in every hour.....It might have been just my microSd problem.... But I wont purchase one of this ever again",
Installed into my galaxy s3 and it reads and writes very fast. Having that much storage is awesome. It had over 59 gb after formating.,
"I bought this to expand my 32GB Dell XPS 10 to 64GB. It fits easily into the Micro SD slot and was recognized by Windows RT upon boot up. I did reformat the card (old habit), and haven't had any problems at all.",
Love every aspect of the Echo. We even went and bought a Tap!,
I use in a tablet.  Works perfectly.  Good size / price.  The more capacity ones will come down eventually but this is perfect right now.,
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
I bought the 32 gb and 16 gb versions to backup photes to my Galaxy Tab 2 while travelling. It works very well an dallows me to view/edit pictures while on the road. It is my primary photo backup system while on the road. The micro SD card is much more secure and less likely to be damaged than a hard drive while travelling.,

"it is an almost required piece for my Samsung tablet.  it was at a good buy. :-)it is easy to use, and easy to install.",
"It's 85% as good as an Echo... Great sound, nice and loud, but... But the button. That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them, IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that, it does everything an Echo does, it's smaller, and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do. But it's not as useful as the Echo in the situation I use it the most.",
"It's tiny,.. in size, - but provides great storage. Tested and works great with all our BlackBerry Z10 - and Q10 devices.. Just remember to format the memorycard by using the Setup on the phone ... and NOT format using your computer..",
"I own several video recording devices (Surveillance, car-based DVR systems, etc.), and the SanDisk Class 10 cards (always use class 10 cards when dealing with HD video) are the only ones which survive these extreme environments.I have been using SanDisk for years, and while I do admit to trying other great brands once in a while, I always come back to SanDisk, and will stick with it.Many non SanDisk brand cards might advertise Class 10 as well, but don't achieve the same writing speeds.  In fact, cheaping out on these cards may result in your video recording devices to become unstable, or worse, corrupt data.Highly recommended!",
"Its just amazing the amount of storage you can get in the size of a pinky nail.  I have this mounted to my phone filled with music, documents, pictures and all of my mobile phone records and messages from the past 3 phones.  Still have plenty of room left and no issues.",
"This card is doing its job in my S4. Lots of room for storing photos, music and videos. Good item.",
"Solid card, used for music on phone and apps, but has been standing in on my DSLR and has functioned great for the purpose. Got the card at $20, which was a bargain, and it's finally full.",
good card. work as describes. haven't had any issue with it or going pass metal detectors. no lost files or missing files.,
"This review is for the second generation Kindle Paperwhite. Like all kindle e-readers before it, this is a great product. However, I am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year's model. For this review, I focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new Paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year's model. Also, I found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising, so I will try to clear them up.HARDWAREDesign - The Kindle white has a nice look and shape. It fits well and is easy to hold in one hand. It's fairly light, so it doesn't tire the hands too much. I can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands. Its design is very similar to the previous Paperwhite - almost identical. The height and width are the same, the buttons are in the same location, and although this version is slightly lighter, it is not noticeable.Display - Although not a huge improvement from last year's model, the display is one of the best features of the Paperwhite. Like most e-readers, the Paperwhite uses digital ink technology. This model employs a more advanced version. In addition, the lighting has been upgraded, so among other things, it is more evenly lit. Together, they make for incredible viewing. In my opinion, it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. I really enjoy reading on it, text look very sharp and crisp, with little to no eye strain.Processor - The Paperwhite has an upgraded processor, which means smoother page turns and navigation. I am able to open books, flip pages, and navigate menus fairly quickly. There is barely any lag as I flip through many pages at a time. Also, the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all.Read more",
"I am updating my review from two months ago.. My initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. Today I have been using the Tap and sling daily for over the last two months and I felt like I needed to modify my review. I originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, I am changing my recommendation.The truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. I have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. I think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. Also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.I initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as I thought it would be. I just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.My only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. I am increasing my stars by one. Really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. I have come to really like the sling. I have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. That has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.My original is below. Overall, I would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the Tap.Received the Tap and the Sling cover in the last 24 hours.Read more",
"This is a great card. The FPS with this card were incredible. I ended up needing more memory, so I bought the SanDisk 64 GB card.",
"I bought this card to replace a Kingston card that my phone fried, it has been working without issues so far.",
"The 64GB card I purchased actually contains 4GB of flash memory and some kind of hack that causes it to appear as a 64GB drive in various drives and readers. Of course, this took me a while to figure out since I only just got around to copying more than 4GB of data to the card, but with some testing I have nonetheless discovered this to be the case.The card I bought was in Amazon Frustration Free packaging. I don't know if cards purchased that way are less likely to be counterfeit than retail packaged versions, but I suspect that I will stick with manufacturer packaging from now on.",
"I love this handheld device especially all the items available for it. Games, books, music, etc. Glad I bought it. Thanks for having it available.",
"You won't be unhappy with a SanDisk card, they even back them with a lifetime warranty. I purchased this for a friend and she's very happy with it",
"Noticeable improvement to my Sprint HTC EVO LTE with this.Camera app used to have bad pictures when I shot in burst mode (several frames per second). With this card it never misses a burst picture.Also apps that have been installed to the SD card are a lot more responsive.Update:Card has died on me, as of May 12th 2013. I originally ordered this October 22, 2012. So I got about 6 months out of it. Oh well.",
Does what is suppose to do.  I purchased it for my Samsung Galaxy Tablet 2 7.0.  No problems or complaints.,
"This card performs much better than the lower class 4 and 6 cards I have used in the past.  I have around 400 pictures on it, as well as quite a bit of other content. Content loads very quickly on my Android phone.  Very happy with this purchase.",
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
What can I say about this memory card other than that it worked when in my phone after the old one caused all manner of problems. It does the job it's supposed to.,
I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy 10.1. It works great! I have had no problems with it!I would definitely buy this again. Seller was also very fast in shipping!,
"Picked up this memory card at a great price on a gold box deal. Reputable name, fast card. However, after several months of trying to get my phone to work with the card, formatted it, partitioned it. &#34;mounted&#34; the card, &#34;unmounted the card,&#34; all to no avail.  I realized that this memory card is not compatible with my Samsung SGH-T769 (Galaxy S 4G). No need to get frustrated and try a Sandisk &#34;Ultra&#34; 32GB Class 10 card in the phone. I replaced this card with a &#34;plain&#34; Sandisk 32GB Class 4 card in my phone, it was immediately recognized, formatted and mounted by the Samsung phone.YMMV",
I got these as a Deal Of The Day.  I recommend checking those out.  Super price for the 32GB capacity.,
"If you like the Kindle Fire HD then you will love the Kindle Fire HDX. The new device runs three times faster, is lighter in weight, and the battery lasts slightly longer. The sound quality on this device is excellent and the display quality is absolutely stunning. Below are some of the features to expect from the Fire HDX. BUILD QUALITY---There is NO blue haze on the 8.9 HDX.---The build quality is excellent.---Auto contrast is good (not buggy).---Operating system is very intuitive except after downloading free prime videos to watch offline. If you remove the videos from your Carousel then, from the video menu, you must go to the left side bar, and click *downloads* to see your videos. PRIME DOWNLOAD ISSUES (free video download limitations)Prime members can download selected Prime Instant Videos to watch when not connected to the internet. There are major restrictions imposed on prime videos as listed below.---Not all Prime titles are available for download.---Most popular prime titles are NOT available for download.---There is a max of 25 titles that can be downloaded free at any one time.---Prime titles have a viewing period.---Viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the video, or 15-30 days (which ever comes first).---After the viewing period expires you need to reconnect to the internet.---Titles can be downloaded to only two separate devices at a time.---If you exceed the device quota then you must delete one of the titles before adding to another device.---There is no way to know which titles can be downloaded unless you have the HDX (amazon does not place a banner on the titles other than to say PRIME).Read more",
So this product is a large disappointment...bought it to use in my tablet but the card is forever getting corrupted....I've reformatted the card a few times but it's to the point now that even a reformat doesn't work..  Wasted money...don't recommend purchasing.,
"Seeing as how everyone in the family has some kind of device that can utilize a microSD or SD card, this item fit the bill and I picked up a bunch to stuff stockings with. These came in a basic white package with the adapter to full-sized SD. 32GB is a nice size, especially for all the new HD smartphones and tablets. I have had better luck with SD cards than flash drives -&#62; nearly all the flash drives I have purchased have died. I have had 3 microSD cards go south on me and zero full-sized SD cards go bad. I installed my stocking-stuffer into a car DVR dash cam where it has been recording my daily drives. Speed testing shows read speeds in excess of 33MB/sec and write speeds of 16-19MB/sec. Should be fast enough for most HD devices.",
"Stick this in the slot and forget about it.  Not sure what is being stored on this little thing or when I should remove it from my phone but, hey, it's in there.",
"This is the first class 10 memory card I have had and boy is it fast, I actually bought two, one for my digital camera and one for my Galaxy 2 7.0.  Saves images really fast in my camera and does not slow down my tablet at all, great product at a great price.",
This is a quality 64gb micro sd memory card. It does what it is supposed to do. I would recommend this to any one.,
I placed the SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card without the  Adapter in my Samsung HMX W200 Camcorder and it works great!,
"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more",
"the first 2 I bought both had multiple problems with not being recognized, this one so far has had no problems.",
"A no brainer here.  Copied the data off the old 16gb microsd, swapped the cards, put the data back on, and 'voila!'  Space constraints relieved!",
Got this to shoot in HD. It is working really well so far. It is handling HD recording and playback great.,
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
"Class 10 16 gb perfect for my phone. Never use anything less than a class 10 in a phone because you will have lag times waiting for the card to respond, for $13 shipped to your front door how can you go wrong? SanDisk has been good for me for many years. Recommended.",
"Stores thousands of pictures, and it worked perfectly in my Lumix camera using an SD adaptor.  Recommend to anyone who wants a 32 GB micro SD card.",
"What can you say? So far it remembers everything it&#8217;s told. No sign of Alzheimer&#8217;s to date. So far I have not seen it stare into space or talk about when it was a child or complain about how different the music is from when it first started storing music or say how much data has changed from back in the day&#8230;&#8230;. Nope, still young and pretty fast, no arthritis in the bits or bytes,",
"I had the card about 3 months in my Galaxy S 4 and then it suddenly went into a read only mode. All the data was still there and I was able to copy it all from the card but could not write or format the card. I searched the internet high and low for a solution and then finally contacted Sandisk support. After explaining my problem, they said it will need to be replaced and it would be covered under warranty. The replacement process took about two weeks, they paid for return shipping. I now have the 2nd card and have had it running for about 2 weeks now.We'll see if I just happened to get a bad one or if they all are of questionable quality.",
"I loved the concept of an ereader that would not be screen time. However, I have found several drawbacks to this version when compared to prior kindles I have owned. First, this product has no speaker of any kind, so it cannot play audible books or even do text to speech unless you use wireless headphones. A big loss - no current Kindle ereader can play audible books -- only older generation kindle ereaders or the Fire (which has the problem of introducing videos to reading time) - and sometimes, my daughter just wants to be read to while she follows along. Second, it operates SLOWLY. Third, the Freetime service is so poorly organized that it is very unlikely that my daughter will be able to find anything she wants there. The categories are not the types of categories you might see in bookstore - e.g. mystery, biography, early chapter books, realistic fiction, series, etc - but an odd collection of categories - e.g. ballet, Frozen, Disney, Trucks, etc. Most of the options seem very commercial and not the types of books I would want her to read. And there is no description of the book (like the blurb on the Amazon website) - so there is no way other than the title (and the unhelpful category) to tell her what the book is about before she downloads and starts to read it. Finally, when I called customer service hoping for a clearer explanation of how to move around within Free time, and to put books from my Amazon account in the freetime library, I got a representative who took long breaks between each one of my questions (presumably because she did not know the answer and had to look it up) and who was very difficult to understand because of her strong accent.Read more",
It works as expected. I use one of these on my Samsung Galaxy S4 and another on my Asus Transformer. No problems so far.,
"I have loved and used my Kindle Keyboard for years now but I missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark. I purchased a Kindle Fire and I also use an iPad 3 but for ease of reading on my eyes I prefer the Kindle Keyboard. I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this new generation was released before I spent my money. I got this because I wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and I just love this new tablet. It offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text.I have added a video of the Kindle Paperwhite compared to a Kindle Keyboard and a Kindle Fire. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I will try to answer them.I love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear. I use the Kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books. Reading was my number one hobby my entire life and I just loved it. The Kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen I can enjoy my reading in every type of environment. I laid my Kindle Keyboard and the New Kindle Paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new Paperwhite. The new lighting system and screen clarity is where this Paperwhite design really is outstanding. With better contrast, lighting and custom designed fonts, the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e-Reader before. With 221 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) this screen provides a 768 by 1024 pixel screen that just makes the old Kindle Keyboard look old fashioned. Technology certainly does move quickly on.Read more",
The touch is a great device to control connected home products. Perfect for outside use for prime music also.,
I love the additional storage for my pics/videos on my S3.  So far no problems.  Reads/writes with no problems or delays.  I got a great price on this as a gold box deal.  Too bad I could only purchase 1.  I can also use in most of my other devices with an adapter.,
This makes a great supplement to not having the latest greatest SSD. I keep some personal documents on my work laptop on the micro SD card to save space on the primary SSD.,
"DO NOT PUT ANY IMPORTANT DATA IN IT. DO NOT USE IT AS A PERMANENT STORAGE TO ARCHIVE IMPORTANT FILES.It just failed after 1.5 months use -- i don't use it too much. Just put all my digital pictures (total: about 30GB) in it and carried in my wallet. I added some more pictures to the disk for a few time in November. Tonight, when I insert it into my laptop, Windows say cannot recognize the disk and said it must be formatted. I tried my MacBook Air and got the same. Neither Mac nor Windows can read it. I formatted it and started to copy the 30+GB pictures again. The copy broke in half way. Cancelled the copy, reinserted the disk and tried to resume the copy. Windows said the volumn is back and told me I must run chkdsk. I ran chkdsk and retried the copy. Still the same failure.I guess the disk has some problem and I don't bother recovering it, since it's not going to be reliable as I expected. Very disappointed. Thought SanDisk is a very good brand. I use SanDisk's CF card in my camera for years and it worked fine. I will fall back to use hard disk to backup my ditigal pictures.So it should be find to use this microSD disk to exchange some large file with friends. But don't put important data in it.

This is the second one of these SanDisk 32 GB MicroSDHC cards I have bought.  One I installed in my Samsung Galaxy S3 and this one I installed in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 - 8.0.  These are excellent options for both devices to expand storage.  One of the reasons I went with Samsung products is because you can use MicroSD cards unlike Apple iPhone products where you can't.,
Works perfectly in my 738 Samsung. Phone is only USB 2 so I don't know if you really need such a fast mem chip. Can get a lot of stuff into 32 gb. I use for Movies for when I am on the train and don't want to waste my data streaming from the cloud.,
I expanded my Samsung Tab 10.1 tablet from 1GB to 32GB works fast and don't see any lags. I can now store more than ten movies on my tab and play right of the flash disc with no problems.Very happy with this card.,
"I have several echo dots around my home, but this makes it easier for me to carry into a room that doesn't have one and control things around the house, listen to the news or music. It holds a great charge.",
"I ordered this memory card because, obviously i needed more space on my phone. One of the reasons why I prefer android to apple products is it is way easier to upgrade storage space with android. My memory card arrived when I expected it to and now I have more than enough space on my galaxy S4....... I once gave this product a five star and everything before this sentence is the review from when I was satisfied with it. But now I'm having problems. I can't delete stuff of of the sd card. I tried formatting it on both my phone and my computer but nothing well delete so now I'm giving it a two star.",
"I wanted to believe that those people who wrote bad reviews on memory cards were just unlucky. Well it sucks being one of them. I cannot get this card to format not matter what device, software or technique I use. The mistake I made was that I didn't use the card right away to see if it was good -I thought, its a memory card, what could go wrong. Now I'm out of the US and returning it is not economically sensible. I don't know if it's quality control, but this card simply cannot work in any reader, device, with or without adapter (write protection off on the reader of course). The card shows up on devices, may even show data being copied then when you refresh, nothing has happened. All formatting software says it's write protected and nothing I do can remove it. Why would a new card come write protected anyway?  Very disappointing, especially since I lost data from my phone.",
"Horrible cover for my new (third) Kindle!!! And it seems to be the only option for the Kindle Fire 7 (cover fits 7th generation). The back side of this cover folds like origami paper. It bends too many ways, is too lightweight, and won't prop up or stay propped up well. You can't stand it up to read on a table with any reliability. Forget it in a real wind or if it gets bumped.Amazon should have given us a choice between a sturdy cover with strong sides that don't bend all over and another, cuter, flimsier cover that can be bent as desired, like this one.Maggie",
Currently using it for my Samsung Galaxy S3. It's very fast when transferring files in and out. No complaints so far.,
"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.",
"I bought this because I was having problems with other MicroSD cards not working in my Surface RT.  I plugged this in, and it worked fine.  I haven't done a full test on performance, but it appears to work at the expected speed.",
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
"Bought this card to use with my Samsung Galaxy Tab2 7in tablet, based on others who have reported getting it to work in their Galaxy Tab 2.Bottom line, you gotta reformat this card as FAT32 with 32kb sectors to work in the Galaxy Tab 2, and that requires jumping thru some hoops as Win6/Vista does not even offer the choice to format as FAT32, only as NTFS or exFAT, neither of which will work with the Galaxy Tab 2 (Android v4.04)  You have to use 3rd party software to accomplish this.  A FREE solution is the EaseUS Partition Master free software you can download from cnet or direct from EaseUS.  I had a commercial package already installed (Acronis DiskDirector) that I used.Once fomatted as FAT32 with 32kb sectors, the card is recognized AND all the space is seen and useable.Highly recommended if you need the space.  I would assume that this would also make LARGER microSDXC cards work as wellJohn",
I wished it came with some sort of USB converter so I can transfer files faster to my PC. I am using a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and File transfer speed is mediocre.,
"I'm not a techie, so I can't do all those great experiments to determine whether or not the transfer speed is as advertised. All I know is, the card works just fine in my Galaxy S3. So far, it has worked great, and seems to be pretty speedy.I have San Disk cards in quite a few of my tech toys, and they've always performed well. I am confident that this one will do the same.",
To be the man you gotta beat the man brotha. And Sandisk is beating the man wit a stick. The price the warranty they are they are letting you steal these from them. So get your hands on some before they realize they giving out the hook up and bam they $100 again.....LOLGo SanDisk go Amazon. I bought 3 and gone buy 3 more.,
I love this little speaker. It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well. The only issue for me is that it doesn't connect with Apple Music. This issue is easily resolved by putting Tap in Bluetooth mode and playing Apple Music through my phone to the Tap,
"If you read the KNOW WHAT YOU ARE BUYING review for the Kindle prior to this one then you know where I am going. Already this new Kindle is riddled with one star reviews from people that seem to not have read the product description. Here goes:*THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!*THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE GAMING CAPABILITY!*THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE PAGE TURNING BUTTONS!Like a regular book you just might HAVE A HARD TIME READING THIS KINDLE IN BED AT NIGHT WITH LOW LIGHTING!What you will get though is an awesome entry level Kindle with software almost identical to the higher end models. The print looks flawless outside, by a window, or under a lamp, in other words, just like a real book.",
Card is well constructed and delivers the wright speeds that it promises. Works great in my Nokia Lumina 822 running WP8.,
I HAVE PUT THE DOT IN THE BEDROOM WHERE MY ECHO IS IN THE LIVING AREA. MY FAMILY USES HER FOR EVERYTHING. ENJOY EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ECHO / DOT.,
"Didnt know it came with an adapter card to make it into a normal micro card, super handy, fits in my tablet perfectly and reads fine.",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"I needed the extra memory in my Galaxy Tab and this filled the bill at the right price. I just wish you could load apps directly to this external memory card since the Tab is limited with 8gb for operating system, apps etc. This card is worth the cost.",
"Card runs great in my Note 2. Not sure how it compares to other ones in benchmark tests now, but there weren't that many options available to me at the time I bought it.Love having 64 Gig's of storage on my phone.",
Sd card works perfect just as you would expect I would recomend this sd card to any one with a camera,
I bought this awhile back. and I must say it worked just fine and exactly what I needed. its nice.,
Speed is meh. Size is good no troubles it comes with a full sized sd converter too. I put it into my tablet.,
"I got several of these for my tablet.. So far I am very happy.. Actually I have one in my phone, one in my tablet, and one as a backup for traveling.. So far they have been great for me...",
"I have read many places that this would not work on Android tablets, but have found that the card requires you to format in a Windows computer to get it to work.  Even tablets that are rated to 32GB have been found to read / write this card to 64GB.  You need to download a free partitioning program, and format using that to FAT32.  First erase the current partition, then repartition to 64GB, then format.  You can't simply use Windows to format to FAT32 on newer Windows computers, and even on older Vista, the max it will allow is 32GB at FAT32.  Using the partitioning software bypasses that 32GB limit and formats the whole card so that when you after insert into tablet reads something like 59.4GB formatted space.  Huge capacity for the money, and a FAST card.  Search internet for formatting 64GB microSD card for Android and read up on it.",
Its very nice and not as big as the echo. Didn't know there was a Tap available to buy.,
"SanDisk has always provided me with a reliable memory product. In the case of this 32 GB card, it went into a Samsung Note 8.0 and my wife could not be more pleased.PROS: Reputable brand, priceCONS: none noted.",
"I got this to expand the memory storage in my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. The tablet and paperwork claim to support up to 32GB, but other reviews for these cards and the Note 10.1 said that a 64GB worked just fine. And work just fine it does.I store mostly music on here, as I've got over 22GB worth of music, which would have taken up most of the 32GB built in to the tablet. I also use my tablet for sheet music, so I needed to have the capability to have all that on there, too. So this was my best solution, and so far it's worked wonderfully.And, on top of that, it came with a MicroSD card to SD card adapter, making file transfers even easier. Overall, I would highly, highly recommend this product!",
I would recommend this memory card to anyone. It works well with my tablet. I have no problems with it.,
"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysJuly 30, 2014Hi Dallas, thank you for sharing your feedback. We wanted to let you know that we made it easier to find your favorite Prime content with the click of your remote. You can now browse many more Prime-only categories, including Top Prime TV, Top Prime Movies, Prime TV for Kids, Prime Movies for Kids, Prime TV by Genre, and Prime Movies by Genre.",
"The card only read as 27 GB not 64 GB. I have formatted in various formats with various tools, and operating systems. I ordered a replacement and concluded this was a dud. Good luck buying this product, rest assured amazon has a good return policy.",
Good purchase and I am satisfied with this card. Would definitely purchase another one. I would advise everyone to purchase this one.,
"Purchased this for my device, it worked as advertised. You can never have too much phone memory, since I download a lot of stuff this was a no brainer for me.",
"Use it in Galaxy s3, note 8.0 and note 10.1. Never had a problem. I'll continue to buy these when I get new devices. Never tried a 64g one. Might.",
"Bought this for use in my phone to expand the memory in it. I have the 32GB GS3. I wanted to double the memory of my phone but I wasn't sure if my phone would take a 32GB card; it did and I'm happy with the product, I also loved the easy-open cardboard packaging. I like that it's easier to open and ship but mostly I like that it's not plastic since I hate the excess trash that puts in landfills.",
"I have not had many problems with what I have bought over the years, but when I do I will make sure to warn others. I loaded a handful of videos from my PC and then installed this in my Android tablet for a trip. Corrupted. Nothing worked and sometimes it can be seen, other times it doesn't even show up. The tablet wants to format it, which it has never been able to do successfully, and needless to say it is too small to even be a paperweight. The SD adapter that it came with was also junk and upon the first time I went to use it, it simply didn't feel right--- so I used my trusty Lexar micro SD to USB that came with my Lexar 32gb micro SD card.I would have expected more and unfortunately as it stands many people have success with them working and equally those that do not. I have even formatted it to see if it made any difference and there was none. And of course my window of return is gone so unless the seller stands behind it--- it is going in the trash. I knew I should have gone with what I had purchased before as I have three of them working perfectly for over a year. Moreover what is even a bigger disappointment is that our camera that uses a standard SD card and it is a no-name with no identifying marks---- has worked for two years without a problem.I do know problems arise, but..... when the cost of a product goes up and up and the quality control goes down--- I am not going to be the one accepting those terms. If you're looking for a good card, search Amazon for this one: LSDMI32GBSBNAR. This is the Lexar and I have thousands of pictures, video clips, and it has even endured three updates to my phone--- plus I carry my phone everyday so it is subject to everyday life all the time, it has been tough stuff.",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
"I have no complaints. I wanted a good class-10 microsdhc card, and this does the job. It has no difficulty keeping up with recordings, photos, music, downloads, etc. Finally, a microsd card that doesn't bottleneck my download speed!",
"I am thoroughly impressed with my Echo Dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs. a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop. The construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the Echo. This case/cover will give your Echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in, but still offer the great functionality of Alexa.",
Well my sister and I got new phones.  So I didn't want to use our old memory cards.  And from what I could tell this product represented the best combination of speed and price.  Plus I'm familiar with SanDisk brand.  They have been working perfectly for us for about a month now and I don't expect that to change.,
"I bought this primarily to use in my Surface Pro. It would randomly dismount itself. I do not know if it was the Surface's fault or the card's fault. Upon doing a little internet searching, I found this to be a common problem with Sandisk cards and the Surface Pro. I used another brand microSDXC and it has worked fine.",
Failed after a year!,
"I have a Samsung Note2, I love being able to record video and taking pictures without worrying about not having enough room, now I do!",
"Just what I am expecting for this brand, I installed it in my tablet the moment it arrives and it works perfectly.",
"For this special price I could not let them go.I bought a few cards for my phone, my gopro and my camera.... Ideal",
As usual SanDisk is the best manufacturer for usb and micro SD cards. I'm using this one for my GoPro Hero 3 Black edition and it works really good. I also compared the specs with other Micro SD brands and saw that this one is the best among other micro SD cards,
I have owned the Echo for about a year now and enjoy the features it provides. Although the Tap doesn't have the hands free feature of the Echo I like its portability. I'm able to take it outdoors at home and using the WiFi play music or even use the other features available by just asking Alexa. The unit is well built and I really like the charging cradle provided.,
Is there any more I can say? No! I get it less than 30 bucks! You can use it in your cellphone or whatever support it.,
Quickly went bad. I used it for maybe 2 weeks. Better keep your receipt. Too bad i didn't.Bad deal. period.,

"Excellent product, awesome color",
expanded the storage space on my 16gb note 2. Check out online to see how to make the phone think its the native space. Fast enough to capture HD video and 8MP photos. Would definitely recommend it!,
I purchased this and could not get it to work. Then I discovered that SanDisk has an app for it. So if you are stressing over this not working in your android device no worries go get the app it will work.,
What more can I say?I'm using it to double the memory of my Asus TF700 (from 32 to 64Gb) and this card has a good read/write performance and it's SanDisk!Recommended.,
I was surprised at the price and quality.  It works great and have not had any problems.  I recommend this for anyone needed a Micro SD card.,
"I have always trusted the SANDISK brand for valuable data.  This was ordered for my tablet and again, great size and quality for the price.",
I got this for my tablet & have used this brand before on other things. It's a reliable brand & I never worry about quality with it.,
"Update on Dec 23 2013 - Please scroll to the very end of this review for 2 month use update. ...For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model. The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080). This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution. The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.Read more",

"I have the original Nvidia Shield TV (not the latest 2017 version) and as such, I also have the older/bulkier controller that it came with. While it works alright, I was never that happy with it just because it's so large and clunky (I have smaller hands) and never got all that comfortable with it. So, I went searching for a replacement controller to use with it...Along came the 2017 Shield TV and a newly revamped controller. Looks nice, got good reviews, but at this time, almost impossible to find one new or used for under 50 which is a bit more than I wanted to pay for a controller.I found the Amazon Fire TV controller searching around and wondered if it would work with the Shield. Turns out that the AFT controller is NOT bluetooth, but rather, Wi-Fi direct. Did a little more research and a few random searches led me to believe that you could indeed use this controller with a Shield TV.Since it's not bluetooth, trying to pair this controller with the Shield (or any other bluetooth device) is impossible. But, at the suggestion of someone on an Nvidia forum, if you go into the Shield's settings and go to the add Shield Accessory setting, while holding the home button on the AFT controller, after a few moments, indeed, it does connect and it does work. It doesn't show up as a Shield accessory (since technically, it's not) so it's kinda weird that way. Nowhere will you see in the Shield's settings or options that the controller is even connected.After connecting or pairing the AFT controller with my Shield I noticed that I lost all sound and audio. The AFT controller microphone works, but it basically caused me to lose all sound on my Shield. Needless to say that bummed me out.Read more",
"Plenty of space, works like a champ. Speeds are fine for a tablet - I mean how fast do these need to be? Transfers go smoothly and the cards read well.",
Been using it for a month and everything works fine.I have my SD card encrypted and it does take a little bit longer to transfer.It does get warm when I transfer files for more than 2 minutes but I have not had any performance issues with it.Overall 5/5,

"Has worked like an absolute charm in my PSP, and for the on going reduced price, I ended up buying a 2nd for my new Samsung Tab 3 even though I didn't need the extra storage (yet).",
I have no issues with this Micro SD.  I purchased it for use with a video camera and it does everything I would expect without any problems.  Wouldn't hesitate to purchase again.,
"Love the Tap! Bought it as a gift and love the sound quality. For such a small speaker, it packs a big punch!",
Did exactly what I expected.  Not worth spending a ton of money on one of these.  This gets the job done without any issues.,
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",

"I was very hesitant to purchase a refurbished unit, but the discount at the time of my purchase was too good to pass up. I was fully planning on returning it if there was the slightest sign of an issue. I have had this unit for about a month now, and it has worked perfectly since I received it. Like a brand new unit. If you can get this refurb for a substantial discount, I think it is totally worth the risk of not buying a new unit.Edit (07/08/2017): My original refurb'ed Echo Dot is still going strong, and I received my second refurb'ed Echo Dot yesterday. This second one is just as like new as my first one. The packaging is similarly like new. It has the same clear sticker covers surrounding it like a new unit, and I believe the power adapter, cable, and manuals are all actually brand new.",
I had no problems installing this into my phone.  The phone picked it up automatically and worked great.  It fit perfectly into Sim slot.,
"I got two of these cards for under $40/ea on small business Saturday and it was worth every penny. The card is fast, i use it in my Note 2/Galaxy S4 and i play music while taking/sending pictures constantly as well as writing s notes with no lag or stutter at all. This automatically gives you enough storage for whatever you should need, no need to ever buy a phone with the most memory because a 16gb version (or whatever the lowest version available is) can instantly have 64GB, just make sure it has expandable memory! SanDisk may have won me over since i always bought Samsung/Kingston memory, would definitely buy this again!",
item i ordered was 64gb it listed it on the card but this was tested and at most was 1gb and very oldi would steer far away from sandisk sold online unless it is in original packagingI returned it for a full refund and reordered and oem 64gb card from samsung,
"I bought this card on the strength of the 64GB XDSC SanDisk in my phone right now.  It was a gift for a friend of mine and sadly it corrupted within minutes of first use.Initially it worked fine, then dead.  We checked in a laptop and Windows Disk Management screen told me it had a single 128K partition and the rest was unusable.  Outstanding.The replacement sent by Amazon (Thank you Amazon, you are always excellent) is sitting in my office right now, I should probably check it out.",
"As a bluetooth speaker, the Tap rocks! The sound quality is excellent, plenty loud when needed, and excellent quality with no stutters in streaming. I bought this one instead of the Echo because it is portable, and I can lug it from room to room. The charging stand is very convenient, and the Tap stays there most of the time. Having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me, but is something to consider. (If you want hands free use, you may want the big brother Echo device, which is hands free, but tethered in place by a power cord, so not portable). The feel of the Tap with the black fabric cover is nice, and will not slip out of your hand. The fabric is like tough upholstery cover, so it won't stain or be easy to damage, but is quite attractive. I am glad they did that, as bare plastic would be easy to drop. I found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless, and it works as advertised! I mostly just use it for playing music and asking Alexa silly questions for fun! I occasionally use it for shopping lists, which shows up on my phone, and checking the weather. Who knows what the future holds,when I have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do? I understand that Amazon plans to add more Alexa skills all the time, and if one got into smart house control with compatible products, the Tap would eliminate all remotes, which I already have too many of. I think it is a really fun, cool item, and I am glad I got it! It is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing, especially the tiny smart phone typing ! I could get used to this! I have the Alexa app on my phone, which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone, like shopping lists, to do lists, calendar. The Tap can also check traffic, weather, movies, etc directly through Wi Fi, no phone needed. However, the Alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the Tap. The Tap can read Audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well! BTW, I haven't had any problems having it understand me, which is amazing, since I grew up in Texas and expected a problem with my accent. Obviously, this item is ideal for people who are Amazon Prime members, so you can stream Prime Music, although it also streams Pandora and other music services, and does many things without any connection to Amazon. I guess the most unique thing about the Tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly, without a computer or phone driving it - that and the voice control. I have paid more for smaller ""just"" bluetooth speakers, so to me, this was a super deal, and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment!",
"The SanDisk Ultra 64 GB is just a storage device, so I don't find that there will be many ""features"" to get excited about. That being said, it is advertised as having 30MB/s transfer speed, but this is misleading. It can READ up to 30 MB/s, however, and the packaging says this too; it writes at a slower rate. I used this for my phone (too much music) and had the stock 8 GB microSD that came with my phone. I had about 6.5 GB of data that I wanted to transfer back to my new microSD card, and this took about 30 minutes. If this were a strict transfer from my internal hard drive to an external it would be faster, but this is not such a connection. It lost a star because the transfer took so long, but in reality, I don't expect to be transferring 6 + GBs of data anytime soon so this problem will be minimal for me. Other than that it works great, and I have not had any issues with the formatting or reading.",
"Pros: 32 GBs more for my tablet. Works great.Cons: None to speak ofOverall: I hold this and I feel like I'm going to lose it. It is the perfect size to add storage to my tablet, though, and that is what I want it for.",
great sandisk micro SD card. havent had anyproblems with this one. its fast and it loads good. i approve this,
"Ordered this from Amazon and was expecting it to work perfectly like my other 32GB sandisk (in my galaxy s4). However, I was really disappointed that upon placing it in my note 10.1 2014 edition the card become unrecognizable. I tried reformatting on the computer, on the phone, and yet, no prevail. It could be the firmware or current update of android, but the point is that, if other companies can make a card that works, why not do the same?

"I use a Sony camera with fairly high megapixels per picture.  I also tend to snap many shots in a row.  So the buffering speed of cards like this is important.  On a recent trip abroad, during which I took 3000 pictures...sometimes using the panorama function...I never ran into any processing delays.  The camera and card let me just keep snapping.  Cards like this are noticed only if they don't perform.  They are otherwise just &#34;there,&#34; which is a good thing.  This one seems to perform.  Obviously, not a technical evaluation, just a layman's assessment after using this card for a while.",
"I purchased this card based on the price.  After I ordered it I finally started reading some of the reviews and started getting worried about whether the card was going to work.  Seems that a lot of people have been having problems getting the phone to recognize the card and then, if needed, formatting the card.When the card arrived I put it in my phone and it immediately was recognized by my android system (JB 4.1.1).  I had already copied all the music, pics and video off my older, slower and smaller card onto my computer so all I had to do was plug the phone into the computer, open the card and copy everything into it.  Everything went in with no problem.  I then unplugged it from the computer and tested my videos and music on the phone and everything worked like a charm.Bottom line, I did not have to format the card, I just plugged it into the phone, it was immediately recognized and worked like a charm.I would highly recommend this card based on the price and the product that you are receiving.",
"Works with my Sansa Fuze+ to give about a million songs (okay, that's a slight exaggeration), but enough songs that you can listen to songs without any repeats for about 4 days.  Speed was fine for my device, but I can't speak to the camera usage.  It's class 10, so it should be fast enough for video.",
I several of these 64GB cards in my GoPro 3 Black and my Canon T3i. Works great in both without any issues. Transfer speeds are lightning quick as well.,
Changes the whole look of the Echo ... after i purchased i think i should have gone with the tan leather. But blue is my favorite color and it adds a bit of a pop to a mundane looking black disk! The texture is also really nice feel and look to it!,

"I have loved and used my Kindle Keyboard for years now but I missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark. I purchased a Kindle Fire and I also use an iPad 3 but for ease of reading on my eyes I prefer the Kindle Keyboard. I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this new generation was released before I spent my money. I got this because I wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and I just love this new tablet. It offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text.I have added a video of the Kindle Paperwhite compared to a Kindle Keyboard and a Kindle Fire. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I will try to answer them.I love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear. I use the Kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books. Reading was my number one hobby my entire life and I just loved it. The Kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen I can enjoy my reading in every type of environment. I laid my Kindle Keyboard and the New Kindle Paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new Paperwhite. The new lighting system and screen clarity is where this Paperwhite design really is outstanding. With better contrast, lighting and custom designed fonts, the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e-Reader before. With 221 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) this screen provides a 768 by 1024 pixel screen that just makes the old Kindle Keyboard look old fashioned. Technology certainly does move quickly on.Read more",
"Works as intended. I use it with my old Sansa MP3 player,and I have another one which is used with my Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 android tablet and they both work fine on both devices after being formatted by the android tablet.

Thinking the card was defective I bought another one (same card type) and installed it with the same result. I have had no problems transferring videos to this card from my Windows 7 computer.",
These sticks have always served me well. This new chip will go in a new Asus Trans. Merry christmas to me.,
Love it great speaker as long as u have access to WiFi,
"Edit (11/10/26) - The volume controls on these are not compatible with the new Google Pixel phones. The volume up button opens up Google Assitant as well as controlling the volume so every time you want to change the volume using the in-line controls you are going to open up Google Assistant.I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable.Read more",
SanDisk makes some of the best SD and Micro SD cards out there. This one is no exception :) :),
"I love this thing, its what I have been looking for in entertainment, its very fast and does gaming well but Amazon slipped up when they only gave this gem 8 gigs of storage space. This is a game changer for sure but it needs at the very least 128 gigs to fully enjoy Fire TV. Would have loved to give Fire TV 5 stars but 8 gigs is being cheap considering that most game titles are now 50 - 300 megs each.oh and one more thing, it needs googles play store so us Android users can use our paid games on this machine as well.",
Bought for my wifes Samsung Galaxy 3 Tab. Lots of storage for pictures and music. Good product at reasonable price.,
Cute speaker. a bit expensive but the amazon streaming capabilities make it worth it,
As new products evolve they only accept SD and microSD cards. I've had good luck with SanDisk and this is no exception.,
One of the best memory card out there! Will look forward to purchasing items again! Will get the 64 next...,
"I read some reviews about the product being iffy, and mislabeled, but the one I got was just as advertised. My Samsung Note II recognized about 59.8 gigs, and the read/write speed is incredible.

"As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing my first impressions of the NEW Fire HD 8 released on September 21, 2016 from the perspective of being a long-term Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the Paperwhite (2013,2014,2015 models), the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9 (3rd and 4th generation), the old Fire HD 8 and the Fire HD 10. Here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new Fire HD8.Amazon has replaced the original HD 8 released in 2015 with an All-New HD 8. Amazon is also removing the Fire HD6, which is a shame as it is a great little tablet.The new HD 8 differs from the old version as follows:BEST NEW FEATURE:The price has been reduced! The 16 GB version of the old device cost 169.99 with special offers (ads). The new 16 GB version costs 89.99 and you can get a 32 HB version for 30 more.SECRETLY REMOVED:Amazon has removed the ability to mirror your display on Miracast devices such as TVs. Now that feature is now only available on generation 4 and 5 Fires including last years HD 8. However, you can still cast Prime videos to a FireTV or Fire Stick.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX:The HD8 Fire, a short 3-foot USB cord and a power adapter so you can charge and use the device right out of the box.SIZE:The new HD8 is a fraction thicker than the 2015 HD8. Leather cases for the old HD 8 will fit the new HD 8 but hard shell cases will not. However the auto wake feature of some older cases won't work.One complaint I had about the earlier versions was that the back was very slick and slippery to hold without a case.Read more",
"I am thoroughly impressed with my Echo Dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs. a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop. The construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the Echo. This case/cover will give your Echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in, but still offer the great functionality of Alexa.",
"I bought this sundisk memory card for my knew cellphone and it is fantastic, it stores all my cell contacts and leave much space to store any apps or programs I want, I recommend it with all my hurt.",

"I'm using this in a NOOK HD+ (Customized Android OS). I use it mostly for music, a few docs. It works as expected with no problems. I have several SanDisk MicroSD cards, but this is the only XC card. They have all performed as expected. I have been pleased with both his memory card, as well as the other SanDisk cards.",
Does all it should without any notable negatives. What more could I ask?I would buy more as I need memory.,

"We have been using Echo since April 2015. Prior to that time, my husband had been hospitalized for several weeks. He is currently wheelchair bound. We immediately installed the Hue bridge and lights as well as the WEMO outlet. With these, and dear, dear, Alexa, he has a great deal of control of his environment in ways that make him much more independent. Others might enjoy Echo for fun and convenience, but for him it is a lifeline! He has even had her turn the lights on in my bedroom when I didn't hear him call.We use the shopping list feature a lot, and my husband has added things to the list that he remembered, while I was already at the store. Should I mention he adds things like chocolate bars when I'm not looking No more paper lists! I just look at the app on my phone and things disappear as I check them off.We transport Echo from the living room to the bedroom, since it is easier for him not to have to use the remote, plus it is always there for his favorite music, an update on news, and to check the weather. Or, when he needs cheering up, I ask for a joke. Tosave plugging in behind his lift chairs, I have ordered a second plug. I love the easy reconnect to the WIFI.I was a bit worried at first about his word slurring with his Parkinson's, but it has worked the opposite way! I notice he focuses his words much better while giving commands. After he forgot her name early on, we added it so he could remember using the Zink hAppy App.My granddaughter was happy to check her math problems using Echo, and in addition to the music stations and Amazon play lists, Echo is a breeze to use as a Bluetooth device. I have used it to play my meditation apps and iTunes music.Read more",

"marvelous, I just fixed it into my camera and it automatically recognized it. great storage for my camera to use",
I have no complaints. It works great in my GoPro. I never worry about running out of space when filming on dives.

There was absolutely no issue with compatibility with my GoPro.,

"UPDATE: December 12, 2012: I had purchased the new Kindle Paperwhite thinking it would be a vast improvement over this Kindle. Well I had mixed opinions on it. You might want to read my review of the Paperwhite here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z0SDFOCZ66Z6/refcmcrrdppermBottom line is that the Kindle 6 E-ink Display is for the money an amazing product. Unless you really do a lot of reading in bed or in dark rooms, you don't need the Paperwhite at nearly twice the cost. I actually returned my Paperwhite due to all the screen issues. My review of the Paperwhite describes all you need to know.UPDATE: September 17, 2012: New firmware is available for the Kindle. It is version 4.1.0 as I write this. It brings some notable improvements to the Kindle experience...New features in this update include:-Improved reading font that is higher contrast and crisper so that you can enjoy a paper-like reading experience.-Parental Controls that allow you to restrict access to the Experimental Web Browser, Archived Items, and the Kindle Store.-Support for books with complex layouts and formats with Kindle Format 8.-Support for children's books with Kindle Text Pop-Up and comic books with Kindle Panel View (which allows you to read a comic book panel by panel). Books that support these features will be available in the Kindle store over the next few weeks.-Dictionaries grouped into a collection in Home and Archived Items called Dictionaries for better organization.Improved table and image viewing (panning and zooming) on supported titles.The update is available from the Kindle Support area on amazon web site.And now, back to my original review...Read more",
Great for pictures and music.  Came in a very secure package and a lot of storage for my files.  Reasonably priced also.,

My granddaughter wanted this for her phone so she could put songs on it.  She loved the card and its capacity.,
"I have tried to copy out the files and it is an astonishingly 40MB/s  Not sure why others are getting such low speed read but it think it is the computer.  Mine is running Core i7, SSD and 16GB ram.  Probably it is why so.  Nevertheless, will see how durable is this microsd card.",
I bought 4 of these for my kids Samsung Galaxy Players.  They perform perfectly and seem to have great transfer rates.,
It arrived on time as schedule. It was purchased on black Friday sale so the price was much cheaper than current listing price. I am now regretting not going with the 64GB as recommended by my coworker.  I purchased it for my new Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone.,
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
"It was time for me to upgrade my Roku 2XS and after looking at the Roku 3 and the Amazon Fire TV I decided to go with the Fire TV. I don't use a lot of the private channels on Roku and the only thing I saw missing that I have on Roku is Spotify and I'll work around that. The main reason I decide to go for the Fire TV over the Roku was the gaming feature. I'm not a heavy gamer but having a device that allowed me to play games with a real game pad for only 99 sounded appealing. I'll break my review into sections so others can quick reference it. I'll say now this got 2 stars because it is FAST and because, if you don't mind getting Amazon VOD stuffed down your throat there is some good content.- SETUPInitial boot up was easy, plug in and go and it autoplays a simple intro video. However, I immediately had issues setting up both Plex and Netflix, Netflix still will not work. I get what looks like computer code with the message error forwarding request to origin On Plex and Hulu+ there is a high pitched, metallic echo with all audio and on Hulu+ I occasionally get a pink/lavender screen with audio but no video. Some internet searching suggested this had to do with a handshake issue and that rebooting should fix it, it didn't. However when I plugged my old Roku back in it worked fine.- NAVIGATION and SEARCH (text and voice)The Fire TV is very, very, very Amazon VOD centered. Most of your navigation data from the main menu pushes you to Amazon movies, TV or apps/games. All other channels reside under the Apps column. As far as I can tell, the voice search only searches Amazon content. This really bothers me as none of the videos, web ads, write ups, etc. mentions this. They brag how they have all your favorite content from Hulu+, Netflix, Crackle, Plex but fail to mention that you cannot search those other apps/channels. BIG turn-off for me. Once inside the other channels navigating and searching works just like the Roku... clicking around with the little remote. The more I think about it the more it annoys me because Amazon advertising made such a big deal out of the voice search and how no one liked clicking around with the remote.- WATCHING TV/MOVIESDon't know. My audio was too awful to watch anything. Never made it to a single show. I tried changing the settings but that didn't do any good. EVERY program has a high-pitched echo on it. However it doesn't have the audio issues when playing games so no idea what the issue is.- PLAYING GAMESTBD. I've played a couple games of Asphalt 8 with the remote and it was pretty cool, but a race car game on a remote is a bit tedious. They show out of stock on the Amazon game controller and it looks like they pulled the Nyko due to poor performance. I'd like to get the controller and see what it's like. If the games are still decent I might swap out the unit and see if that fixes my sound/video issues.- OVERALL IMPRESSIONI do not like the Amazon Fire TV and I'm displeased with Amazon for it. I've always trusted Amazon as a company, and they've always taken care of me before, but I feel like they pushed a lot of smoke and mirrors to sell this device. I'm torn between trying to get it to work and just returning it and getting a Roku.",
I used this on my dashcam that records 720p continuous for 12 hours without fail. Also used this on my Zoom H1.,
"My Amazon Echo Dot does not require the user to enter pairing mode to connect to the device via bluetooth. I live in an apartment complex - two of my neighbors have connected to my echo dot without any input on my part. The dot appears as a pairable bluetooth device at all times. This is a major security flaw, considering that this devices is connected to my network and my amazon account, and is listening at all times. I will be keeping this device unplugged until this flaw is fixed.",

"First of all I am not rating this product as a 5 star like it the greatest item ever, I am rating this product as follows, would it have been the same product if I bought this at the retail store, was it worth the money saved to buy it online, and am I happy with the product I got in the mail. If all those are a yes for me then I will give it 5 stars. I am not just rating it 5 stars cause its the best product of its class, that is for each person to decide. I will also be updating the reviews as I see fit if I decover something in the future. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.I have has a SanDisk SD card for 2 years with my phone and it has lasted through the tough times and high heat. I bought this to add movies to my daugther's Galaxy Note 2 10.1 tablet, No changes are needed to format it just plug and play. Buy this product with any of the new Samsung tablets or Note 2 and it will just work :)",
A cheaper alternative than buying a tablet with more storage. Shipped promptly and the price was reasonable..I will probably purchase another.,
"Perfect for my Sansa Clipp MP3 player.  Plenty fast, and was priced right.",
"I bought this tablet for its size, economical price point, and the ability to watch content offline. And it offers exactly that...but falls short on performance parameters. If you're price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet, large screen, and the ability to watch content offline, this is a great device to get. However, if you already have an earlier Kindle like the HDX 8.9 or even an earlier version of the Fire, I recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn't really be a worthwhile upgrade. I have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device.The- constant freezing of the device,- slow speed to load apps,- significant lags when switching apps that only become worse as you load more stuff on the tablet,- erratic wifi connection that drops often and the ensuing trouble to connect back to the same network, and- the frequent need to reboot the device,all factors made this a frustrating device to own . The HDX is far better in every aspect, heck even the original Fire 7 runs better than this device.The only good things about this device are the screen size and the MicroSD slot. So if you're only watching videos on this, and would like to have the option of watching content offline when you're traveling, this tablet would be just fine. Otherwise, the HDX is still a better option, or you could get the 7 or 8 Fire models. Those are priced cheaper and work better.Original review is below---For the price point and size alone, the Fire HD 10 would seem like a good deal. For its performance, however, it falls short of expectations. I would probably rate it a 3.5 overall. If it wasn't for the price, the rating would have been even lower.Read more",

"Used it in a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it was ruined within a month.  Second one I went through on that phone.  Contacted Verizon, Samsung, SanDisk, Google, and read a lot of forums.  Turns out a lot of people were having the issue with that phone and these cards.Of course the girlfriend threw away the card so I couldn't return it, so I don't know if the issue was fixed or if was a bad batch of cards that went out or what.  It's been a few months and I haven't seen the problem as much as before, so I can only assume it was a bad batch.I've had another card in my phone for a while and haven't had any issues, so for now I can't recommend this specific card unless their issue has been addressed.",
"I purchased 2 128GB SD cards, one for my Nokia Lumia 1520, and another for my Surface Pro 2, both devices took the card without any issues.As for read/Write speeds, I am sure there are better options, but this is the only 128GB Micro SD card available right now, and Sandisk did an amazing job with the product.And currently at $119.99(For how long, I am not sure), it's a great deal, considering a lot of the good SD cards are in the $140 range still.No issues with either card unmounting itself, put them in, transfer files, and you're good.",

We're excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound, and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD. As you correctly point out, the new Kindle Fire HD is the successor to last year's entry level Kindle Fire, which does not include features such as camera, microphone, or HDMI port.

"I'm a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to compare the latest Kindle to. I don't own a Nook. I don't own an iPad (and, in any case, that's comparing apples to oranges). I don't have a Sony e-reader. 'This will be a short, simple review.I received my Kindle about a week ago and haven't been able to put it down.Things I like about my Kindle1. The e-ink display is amazing.2. Using the 5-way controller is simple and effective.3. Page turn speeds are faster than I thought they would be.4. It's lightweight, even with the attached cover (I have an Amazon cover with a built-in light)5. Page-turning buttons are quiet and well-placed.6. Recharge time is fast.7. I can order a book and start reading it in less than 60 seconds. Nice!8. Portability... I can take 3,000 books with me when I travel for work and not require additional suitcases or baggage fees.Things I'm not too keen on1. Buttons are too close together and are laid out oddly.2. Lack of individual number buttons is frustrating.3. Power button on the bottom Not a bad thing. Just an odd thing. (Same for the headphone input). I usually rest the bottom of a book on my lap when I read.Things I hope change in the future1. How books are organized... When I put a book in a collection (which is actually a tag), it still appears in the main list. It's not actually moved, it's merely associated.2. The look of the main screen. I'd like folders or some other way to display collections.3. Ability to create personal screen savers.4. E-book pricing, though Amazon has little control over this. Still, most titles are the same price as or less than their hardback/paperback counterparts.Read more",

SanDisk told me I needed to send this to them to format it. It will not recognize in any of my items.,
"When i got this memory card, noticed the writr protect lever was hard to move. Instead of just sending it back I tried to meve it and the mdmory card broke on hslt.I hanve many SNdisk cards and havd had no troible with them. I guess I just got one that missed wuslity conttol on the line.Dont want to buy another but what do you do.",
"I got my first Kindle. This is a nice ebook reader. I'm going to jump right in and tell you what I found to be its Pros and Cons. Then I'm going to tell how it compares to its biggest competitor, the Barnes Noble Nook Simple Touch.Kindle's Pros:Great Screen: Many people do not find LCDs hard to read on (e.g. smartphones, tablets, Kindle Fire, Nook Color, etc.), but virtually everyone will find E-Ink easier to read, any time of day. Especially the newest E-Ink Pearl displays. They simply look like paper and ink. I have never experienced any eye strain reading E-Ink book readers, but I have with LCD based phone/tablet screens.Thin and Lightweight: This Kindle is thinner than any paperback and lighter too. This makes it very easy to hold in a sitting position, and for long periods too. It also makes it easy to transport in a purse, backpack, or messenger bag (or in luggage for traveling). Many people like to take a few books when travelling, and this Kindle lets you take as many as you want and adds virtually nothing to your travel burden.Good Value: Even without a touchscreen, the Kindle is a good value. It is a well-made product, it offers cloud storage of your books (and well it should, since it offers no ability to expand storage capacity with an add-in microSD card), the screen is excellent, Amazon is a dogged competitor in book pricing. The Kindle 4 is the best value of Amazon's E-Ink readers. Some may be tempted to get the version with the built-in light. If you can afford it, sure, go ahead. But let me point out you don't have to spend 20 for a fancy-schmancy book light. Your local dollar store has them for ... wait for it ... a buck.Read more",
this card is great you can save lots of pictures or files on this card the card works great in most phones,
"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more",
"It's a memory card, what can you say?  It was a good value, and has held up its end of the deal.",
No problems I have two and I bought one for a family member. She loves it. I need four more words. I will keep buying it.,
"For the price, this helps speed up my phone significantly by freeing up memory used by the camera and apps.",
"This is the THIRD power charger that I have HAD to buy at cost of over 30 each since my Kindle Fire purchase. Why can't the chargers last a REASONABLE amount of time When I connected this charger, I received a message saying that it was a LOW level charger it probably would not charge while the Kindle was in use. NOT ACCEPTABLE for this cost!!!",
"Just as with many other reviewers here, my card worked perfectly for the first week and a half, and then suddenly lost its format and could no longer be reformatted, while at the same time overheating dangerously. Sandisk is currently issuing an RMA to replace it, but I am worried that the replacement could also end up being defective. As is evident from the 1-star reviews here, the rate of such defects for these cards is about 10%, which to me seems like an absolutely unacceptable number for a memory card for a major manufacturer. And it's not like Sandisk hasn't had a heads-up on this problem -- the negative reviews have been there for quite a while. Clean up your act, SanDisk!",
This sd card is great for my note 3. worked perfectly for almost half a year. I would recommend it to everyone.,
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
"This was SO easy to set up. We were up running in less than 10 minutes and WOW. This is primarily my hubby's toy (I play on the computer, he flies the TV). Voice search is SUCH a timesaver. I used to have to stop whatever I was doing to type in whatever he needed to search for. NOW, HE CAN HANDLE IT. Speak and ye shall FIND. Love, love, love this boxThe speed of the video loading is awesome, as is the intuitive search function (Amazon KNOWS what he likes, so his lists are more or less pre-filtered so they load faster).I waffled for WEEKS before buying this. I read tons of reviews finally decided it would be worth the temporary (Honey, HOW DO I DO THIS) change in look, feel, etc. (we've been streaming with a Roku since about 2009 had the Roku XD for a long time, just before the change to FireTV).Finally, I decided to try it, thinking if Hubby had too much difficulty adapting, we'd just send it back (while also TRUSTING AMAZON to have made a massive leap forward--have never, myself, been disappointed with any of their electronic offerings).I was expecting to have to sync it with our router, sign on to our accounts again and again (Amazon, Netflix, etc.).NOPE. Plug it in.It turned itself ON.Updated ITSELF.FOUND my router.Was PRE-LOADED with my Amazon account.We were from box to watching in under 10 minutes (there's even a 2 or 3 minute cartoon TUTORIAL that teaches you everything you need to know to stream use your remote--easy breezy).When he wanted to try Netflix, he was able to EASILY click to install an app, then I *painfully* used a grid-keyboard to logon to Netflix account (username pwd) only ONCE and we were DONE.The voice search is SUCH a leap forward. It's incredible AND accurate. Can voice search by title, genre, director, actor, everything. And it even understands SOUTHERN. WooHooIt has 4 times the processing speed and 4 times the memory of our previous Roku box WOW what a difference in loadtime, resolution, quality of picture/vividness of color. Just awesome. What can I say Amazon did it again.Movie/Program descriptions are displayed at the bottom of the screen ( my ONLY quibbling complaint is you can't change the font size on descriptions w/o altering TV resolution, which I won't do). They do have excellent Closed Captioning functionality for those who need it you can enlarge the fonts there for easy readability.Basically, I'm very happy we took the plunge it really was a worthwhile improvement for us (we prefer Amazon's video streaming anyway--they have lots more documentaries than the other streaming services).I'm just sorry I waited so long : )---------Quick Update:Not all apps come preloaded on the device, though a ton of others did (Pandora, Bloomberg, Showtime Anytime, Netflix, Vevo, Vimeo, WatchESPN, Crackle, HuluPlus, iheartradio, and tuneinradio).IF you have an Amazon Kindle TABLET (I'm guessing like the HDX), you can somehow toss photos from the tablet directly to the Fire. Meaning, sitting in your living room, you can, apparently, swipe the photo across the screen and it lands on the Fire. (Don't have that, so can't DO that). HOWEVER, we do have many photos saved to Amazon's Cloud Drive they were all accessible from the FireTV console (via the TV, with just a click)--even a short family video we'd uploaded. With no interference from me. Just clicked on Photos there they were. EASY. A very nice feature.",
"There were Known Issues with Sandisk and GoPro HERO3 Cameras. So much so that if you paid attention, you'd see that GoPro discontinued selling Sandisk MicroSD cards on GoPro's website. Good thing too, because GoPro was totally over-charging customers for MicroSD cards, and still are!Having said all that, I'd like to share with you that the Sandisk Class 10 32GB MicroSD card works perfectly with my HERO3+ Black Camera.PROS:Immediate recognition of MicroSD Card by my computerImmediate recognition of MicroSD Card by my HERO3 and HERO3+ CameraClass 10 Speed allows me to do minor edits right from the MicroSD Card, even through USBClass 10 Speed makes file transfers quick and painlessCONS:Had trouble being recognized by my HERO3 camera",
Don't really use this for speed tests or anything but to hold music and everything it works great would recommend doesn't fail a lot and lose files,
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",

"I have used the Fire TV for a day, and I think that it is an enormous leap forward in set top box functionality. My brief review follows. But first, I'd like to comment on some of the negative reviews I've seen for the product. Many of them are from people who haven't purchased the product. Others gripe about what the product doesn't have, even though they product clearly states that it doesn't have it - for example, there is a lot of grousing about no HBOGo. Whether that comes to the FireTV or not, it isn't available right now. A one star review because one app is missing Or you can't stream some content from your hard drive (even though there are apparently apps that will perform this task for the Fire TV) Well, take those types of reviews for what they might be worth.Let me start by saying that I own two Roku 2's. I've owned Roku's for quite some time. I don't own the Roku 3, so my comparisons are probably stale. The Roku is a great product, and you can't go wrong owning one. But let me describe the features of the FireTV that have so far delighted me:1. Easy connection to my WiFi connection. I have never been able to connect to my 5G network where my TV is located with my Roku. The Fire TV picked up the signal easily, and streaming is seamless. It could be the dual antennas. Whatever the reason, if signal capture is an issue for you, the Fire TV seems to work well.2. Loading of videos is very fast, almost instantaneous. I select a video, press the remote to play, and within 2 seconds the video is streaming with no buffering issues. It's very impressive.3. Set-up was a breeze. EDIT: I have read that some people had an issue with the initial update that the Fire TV requires. Mine updated with no problems. I was able to connect to my WiFi, and my update downloaded and installed automatically.4. Voice search is very well done. It took me a couple of attempts to learn to search after pressing the button and then hearing the beep to talk. Once I figured that out, I was searching for movies and TV shows easily. The search results have been accurate. This is a huge time saver and a great convenience. Only Amazon content is selected during the search process. I understand that the other content providers have to permit search into their applications for it to work.I have not figured out how to fling my Fire HDX screen to my TV yet. Once I figure this out, it will open up all kinds of other options for the Fire TV. I didn't buy the product for this feature, but I'm interested to get it working. This could be a huge game changer, as you can access content at other sites on the web and display it on your TV. I hope Amazon provides more help to accomplish this.I purchased the gaming controller and was able to pair it with the Fire TV. I haven't played anything yet. But I'm intrigued by the options.One disappointment I have to mention: where is Amazon music My music collection should be available front and center. There's an app for my phone, there is an Amazon music player app for Roku, so Amazon should integrate the music collection. It makes sense that they would do so in order to bring even more value to the entire Amazon content platform. I'm thinking that there will be something shortly, as the rumor is that Amazon is going to provide a music streaming service in the very near future. Amazon needs to address this promptly.Overall, if graded as just a simple streaming box, it gets a 5. With the other options the Fire TV may provide - Miracast screen duplication, games, etc., the product certainly exceeds my expectations.UPDATED 4/5/14: I've had the Fire TV for two days now. I was so pleased I purchased another, and they have now replaced my Roku 2XD's. Both of mine set up in no time, and had no issues connecting quickly to my WiFi network and installing the initial download. I don't have a over-technical set-up for my WiFi. I have a Comcast cable modem (3rd gen) and a Netgear router. My Fire's saw the router with ease, and connected the 5G band. This is something only one of my Roku's could do because of the distance that one of them was from the router.The video quality is superb. I don't have these boxes set up to take advantage of Dolby 5.1, just simple TV speakers. But, the sound is forceful and clear. I've not had any issues of whining or other distortion that some have mentioned.The voice search is frankly amazing. I have read that some people don't like it or feel it is too limited. But for searching your Amazon options it is outstanding. For me, it is fast and accurate and is a huge time saver. I am eagerly awaiting adoption of the technology by other app vendors.The screen layout does take some time getting used to. I won't call it clunky, but it is crowded. It lists items in a fairly rigid order depending upon the category you are in. And yes, Amazon content comes first. That' to be expected. But Amazon doesn't block your access to other apps. If you want HULU or Netflix, you can get to them easily. You can even use voice search to find the app you want. I suspect there will be some streamlining of the interface at some point. The interface does tie into the interfaces on Fire HDX somewhat, so I can see the attempt at consistency here.Gaming so far has been limited, but I've found a great pinball app and am reliving my younger days on the tables. The gaming controller works well, and I don't have any lag playing the game. I haven't attempted any others yet, but I look forward to a good driving game. I'm a casual gamer, not hard-core, and this system may just fit the bill. My Xbox glory days are over, as my kids thoroughly thrash me at Call of Duty.All in all, this box delivers exactly what I wanted and more.",
I use this in an ASUS Android tablet. I've had no problems using it to transfer data between the tablet and PC. No trouble with storage errors either.,
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
I was impress with the value and quality. I used SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 with my ASUS 300TF it works great!,

I use it to put my music videos and movies on. Works great with my tablet and there is no stalling on the movies or videos.,
"Thanks for taking the time to read this review!This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say alexa and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen. We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its multi-room voice recognition technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word alexa on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a multi-device plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices.Read more",
First of all Amazon has shipped the mobile version of this card. It is different that what was listed on the page. There goes a star for incorrect shipping. And the item has stopped working after a week in my Surface tablet.,

"A few months ago I purchased a Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Note. It was my very first tablet. I didn't know much about them, a friend told me I need one. I couldn't do without it now. I was having issues with the storage, and was told I needed a SD card, and this was the one I was recommended because it had the most storage.I managed to put the in myself after watching a video on YouTube. My friend told me to downloaded App manager from Play Store, which I did and after clicking on App manager to open it, I successfully transferred all my Apps to the SD card. I checked in settings, now I'm happy because I have tons of room for other things.I've had it a couple of weeks now, even though I've added several more Apps and my bookmarks etc, I still have no storage problems. I was told that this card is the best, I have no complaints, it's doing a great job. I'm glad I didn't go for a cheaper version.",

"Arrived today. As always shipping from Amazon is the best.I read the reviews, and decided I would give the SanDisk 64GB MicroSDXC a shot, normally I go with Patriot for all my flash memory.So one thing I read that worried me, was the heat issue. Well I can say that it does run hot.How hot you ask? I can feel it through the back cover of my Samsung Galaxy S3. Not plastic melting hot. But I know it is there.Is that an issue? Maybe? Maybe not! I have never really noticed any of my previous cards getting hot. Sure even some of my USB sticks run hot after a transfer.Is it cause for concern? I honestly don't know, yet.I will use it and see if heat causes any issues. If anyone has had the same problem feel free to comment and tell me what happened or if you contacted SanDisk.I am thinking about calling them and also Samsung to find out what max temperature range is acceptable. As I really don't want to ruin my bad-a$$ new phone.Otherwise this is a lot of space for cheap. Can't complain there. I gave it 5 stars for that reason alone.The heat issue is something else and I wont take a star off just because of that.But I will still be concerned until I have some answers.Thanks for reading.",

Fast transfer speed and got it for a great price. Used in my GoPro Hero 3 BE for many hours of recording and haven't had an issue.,
Got this for my phone and it works great so far. Transferred music and pictures super fast from my computer to the card. Needed more memory and this is perfect.,
"I bought this to use on my tablet (an Asus Transformer TF101) to backup some of my data before I flashed a custom ROM. Works as expected out of the box; no formatting or fiddling needed. It comes with an SD card adapter and a little plastic case for it and the adapter. Android and the recovery kernels I've used have no trouble detecting whatever the default filesystem is on it.The one thing I would note: if you have an older SD card reader on your computer, it may not be able to read HC or XC micro SD cards. You may want to check if your read supports them.I recommend this to anyone who needs a SD or micro SD card for any purpose. It's cheap, tiny, and has massive storage capacity for it's size, so long as your device supports it.",
Works exactly like it is supposed to. I can't wait however for a 128 GB card to come out and blow this out of the water.,
"For its size, this little disk is absolutely amazing. It does everything as advertised and then some. I will buy more of these disks",
What a terrific device. You can ask it anything and she has an answer. It's small enough to place anywhere so it doesn't look instructive,
"Got it fast. Works as described . Comes with management software that must be downloaded for iTunes or google play store that links all your cloud services like drop box,sky drive, and other popular account types. Great product would and did buy again.",
"Very fast, reliable product. I use it every day in two computers, saving multiple files from one pc and moving them to another as backup.",
Unless your really stringent on form factor (and negligible speed) always get these with the adapter. Some phones do not transfer data that quickly and the adapter is a life saver. Always have it in my PC when dumping large files. Speed is actually a big improvement over the 32GB card.,
"My SD card showed only a little more than 29 GB available for my 32 GB card.  That's the bare minimum I'll accept without sending it back.  I'm normally happy with the brand name SD cards I buy on Amazon, though.  For the price I paid for this particular card, my expectations were higher.",
"This card advertises itself as UHS1 but it's actually UHS50.This means that it will not go up to SDR104 speeds/throughput.Not necessary bad, just false advertising.",
"I have owned a Kindle for several years now. I have had the 2nd generation Kindle and I have had the Kindle Keyboard. When my mom expressed interest in getting a Kindle I decided to give her my Kindle Keyboard because she doesnt have Wifi in her house and my older Kindle Keyboard had 3G, which is what she needed. And I decided to buy the Basic Kindle for myself because (1) I didnt want to wait for the Paperwhite to come out and (2) I just needed Wifi and (3)and most importantly I JUST WANT TO READ A BOOK, not listen to text-to-speach, or go shopping on Amazon, or listen to music, etc. All I want to do is read a book...thats it! This Kindle is perfect for that. Its smaller and lighter, the pages turn faster than the Keyboard version, it basically has everything I need to download a book and read a book with a much better price than the Paperwhite or Keyboard. Yes, you have to navigate through the keyboard on this kindle with a 5-way controller, but I rarely use the keyboard anyway. To download a book, I just search and buy books on my computer and send them to my Kindle...which is much quicker no matter what version of Kindle you have. So if you dont need, want, or use all the extras then I would definitely recommend the Basic Kindle for 69 with special offers, because who really pays attention to the screen savers anyway.",
Like a previous reviewer mentioned it is fabric over hard plastic it is not a snug or tight fit. Good quality though.,
"Transfer speeds are consistent with advertising. The card works, and has worked for months now. Great product. Now I need a 64gb..... At least I know which company to go with, SanDisk.",
"With the smaller electronics we finally are able to save on a card, it has an adapter so it will fit in the larger bays.  There is a lot of storage in such a small space.  I have been looking for the small cards to fit in my pad.",
"SanDisk makes great products and this one's just another of them.  I'm using it in a vehicle dash camera to record HD .mov format video and on my shakedown run the camera and the disc worked perfectly together!  32gb of space gives me plenty of room to record, and the Class 10 rating means the card is plenty fast enough to keep up and produce crisp and clear video.  Color was also good.",
I got an amazing price and this is an amazing product. 64 gigs is a lot of memory. I don't think I'm ever going to fill it up but it's nice to have it. It has given me no problem so far.,
"I am updating my review from two months ago.. My initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. Today I have been using the Tap and sling daily for over the last two months and I felt like I needed to modify my review. I originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, I am changing my recommendation.The truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. I have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. I think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. Also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.I initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as I thought it would be. I just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.My only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. I am increasing my stars by one. Really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. I have come to really like the sling. I have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. That has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.My original is below. Overall, I would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the Tap.Received the Tap and the Sling cover in the last 24 hours.Read more",
great value and works perfectly.,
"I ordered this memory card for my Drift Ghost-S action camera. I started getting errors and the camera was freezing and saying there was a storage problem. I assumed the camera was faulty and actually exchanged it for another camera. Same errors. I switched to a SanDisk Extreme card and never had problems again.If you're going to be recording HD video, especially at high frame rates then do not get this card. I'm sure it would be fine in any other scenario though, but it's advertised as a class 10/UHS 1 card and it's just not as fast as other class 10/UHS 1 cards.Drift Innovation (the company that makes the Ghost-S camera I use) has stated in multiple support tickets with me not to use any ""SanDisk Ultra cards"" because they do not perform fast enough for the camera and will result in slow card errors. They work ok until you try recording 1080p video at higher frame rates.",
I use Sandisk exclusively for serious pro-sumer work including 4 hour concert videos. I've never had a problem in 3 years and wouldn't use anything else.,
"Cannot go wrong with SanDisk and to date it works as advertised. The price wasn't a great cost savings but because it came from Amazon which has a great reputation to date as far as I am concerned, I purchased through them.",
06.NOV.2012 - Bought the card.12.JAN.2014 - Card failed.It cannot be formatted or used in any way.It lasted 14 months and most of that time I was not even using it.,
Exactly what it looks like. 64 GB micro SD card. reads and writes well. Comes in good packaging with an SD card adapter. SanDisk brings a high quality product and I tend to stick with them over some other cheaper brands.,
"Use this in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Have had it for almost a year now, no problems, really expands your memory capabilities, easy enough to install.",
"Major fan, didn't buy this because of protection, bought it cause it will blend in to my decor. It is not a skin, so it's not skin tight. Yes it's loose but how often will you grab it and move it. Me maybe once every year.",
Good micro SD card. I love SanDisk's products because they have a  good warranty policy. I would recommend this product.,
"Remote didn't work, did all the troubleshooting to connect, sent me a replacement remote that didn't fix it, and then when I sent the replacement remote, they couldn't find it and charged me anyway. Very disappointed.",
"I used this to replace the existing Transcend MicroSDHC card in my phone. I find that only a few pieces of my equipment can access it - apparently some older firmware devices do not recognize 64 GB SD. One trick I found - I was able to format this in my tablet, then move it into my phone. Initially, my phone reported it as a corrupt SD. Other than that, I have had no issues with it - it is reliable and stable, but not lightning fast. It took me over two hours to copy my photos and music onto it.",
Its a good price and have never had any issues with the card deciding to stop recording. I have used it in a Hero3 and 3+ always recording in 1080p at 60fps.,
Either it is the wrong chip or a false reading by the device because the data displayed consistently is &#34;insert ..&#34;,
Great write speed and lots of space! I bought this for my Galaxy S3 and formatted to Fat32 and it works great!,
Probably enough storage space to handle most people's personnel information needs.  Just don't forget where you hide it.,
I have a program that allows me to condense the movies I own into about 1GB size. I transferred them to this card and am able to watch movies on my Samsung tablet. I also have music and home movies on there. When my husband had surgery recently and waited for hours in the waiting room. I watched funny movies and family movies. It took my mind off things and the time sped by.,
Memory card fit my phone just fine.  More memory for more apps.  Great price as well. Item was well packaged and showed up within the time frame given.,
I have used this for months on my Galaxy S4 with no issues and it is plenty fast to transfer content to this card.,
Bought this at a very good bargain from Amazon and the cards performed amazingly great on my devices. Definitely worth the purchase. Thumbs up for the good buy.,
"i am not always giving out good comment. But this is perfect, you know , perfect!maybe because of the size... no mistake will happen.",
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is.

We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more.

But later realized that I had to format the card from the flip down menu. Now it works Perfect. Was going to look for a Gen4 64gb ipod touch, $350 vs $55 makes no sense.

"Sling is simply awesome and so is the Amazon Tap!! My tap arrived this morning along with this sling and I am currently testing both products out as we speak!! This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.) I love the bright and vibrant colors6.) Silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging7.) Doesn't adversely affect sound qualityOverall: I do feel 20 for the sling is a little high but for the protection it provides my brand new tap, I very happy with it.. I didn't buy my tap to sit still at home..Read more",
"Edit 6/15/17 After three months of use, I still don't love it. It works well, no complaints, but it marks up easily and the sides began flaking off. My original black cover had shown signs of wear due to repeatedly falling asleep with it folded back. I was much more careful with the merlot, and it showed more signs after a shorter period of time. And the flaky thing along the sides looks and feels just cheap. And for 90, I would expect real leather. So I switched back to my original black cover and I'm just letting it age with the device. I guess the plus side is that the merlot made me like the black cover more, but the downside is it cost 90 to do so. Ridiculous.As stated in the title, I love my Oasis. I've had it for about six months and, with the exception of the defective first one I received which was promptly replaced, I haven't had a problem out of it. I had gotten the black cover because black is my default choice, always. However, a couple of months ago I had gotten a screen protector and skin for the Oasis, and I just wasn't feeling the black cover anymore. I had considered the merlot (I think the walnut would feel nicer to the touch, but I despise brown leather) so I gave in after much consideration and ordered it. It didn't arrive with the bundle of things that it was supposedly shipped with, but after a quick call to customer service I had a new tracking number. It finally arrived today. I am disappointed to say that I don't love it. It smells funny, as I done remember my original doing. The color is duller than in the picture. Maybe my expectations had overblown due to the wait and the whole two tracking numbers thing, but I just don't love it.Read more",

Memory either works or not what more can be said than it works as designed.  I was very happy with the price.,

"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more",

works great for the price ad I use it for music and pictures. cant beat the quality and reliability of this brand,

"Review updated September 17, 2015As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing this review from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the 2013, 2014 and new 2015 Paperwhite, the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9. This review is for the 2015 All-New Kindle Paperwhite. The attached picture shows the 2014 Kindle on the left and the new 2015 Kindle on the right. Here is the summary of my initial impressions of the 2015 model versus the 2014 model.I am somewhat disappointed in the 2015 version as there is not a huge improvement over last years model. The Paperwhite made many improvements from its original first generation 2012 model to its second generation 2013 model, especially in the display and processor area. The 2013 model came with 2 GB storage, a wonderful display, a great battery and was the e-book workhorse. The second generation 2014 model changed by only increasing storage to 4 GB. The third generation 2015 model increased the display resolution but reduced the battery life slightly.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: A Paperwhite device, a quick-start guide and a short USB cord. Amazon still does not supply a power adapter.SIZE: Its the same identical size as the older Paperwhites. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.3 to 7.2 ounces, a fraction of an ounce, most likely because of a smaller battery.The good news is that all cases that fit the other Paperwhites will fit the 2015 version!!DISPLAY: The resolution has been bumped up to 300 ppi, equivalent to the Voyage.Read more",
"It is so hard to imagine that you can have 32 GB is something smaller than a postage stamp, yet here it is.I bought this card to work with my Call of Duty Ghosts Tactical Camera and it works perfectly.  The camera came with a 4 G card which I filled in just over an hour at the local Kart track.  I missed the last bit of our race due to insufficient capacity.  The battery was still going strong so I needed more card for recording my adventures.This card fits the bill nicely.As a UHS Speed Class 1 (roughly equiv Class 10) card this SD card is quite capable of any photographic or video need up to Full HD (not 2k or 4k).  I use a similar card in my Canon 60D and am able to hold around 700 raw images, and a few hours of HD video.Here are some benchmarks for comparison including this card.MacBook Pro Retina SSD430 MB/s write323 MB/s readGeneric Class 6 4GB (Came with Ghost Camera)9.8 MB/s write21 MB/s readSanDisk Extreme Class 10 8GB21 MB/s write23 MB/s readThis Card San Disk Ultra UHC 112 MB/s write45 MB/s readWhat does this mean?  It means that you should have no trouble recording HD video reliably with this card.  Your camera will be able to save pictures quickly to this card so it is ready to take the next shot.  If you fill the card completely it will take roughly 12 minutes to copy all the data off of the card, assuming the device you are copying to can keep up.The tests were done in the built in SD card drive of the MacBook Pro using the included SD Card Adapter.Based on my tests, I would say that if you don't really need a Micro SD, then you should buy a standard SD card, your performance might be better and the price should be lower.  However, if you think you need or might need a Micro SD down the road, this is a suitable solution.",
Works perfect in the Surface RT. Easily integrated into the file structure by using the Libraries function of Win RT.,
The SanDisk memory card is awesome. I usually only buy SanDisk products because they are very reliable. Very good quality.,
"Product: SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-ARating: 5/5 (Excellent)People buy MicroSD cards with 4 primary criteria in mind: (1) Storage Capacity, (2) Price, (3) Reliability/Compatibility/Availability, and (4) Speed.  When I bought the u64 back in Feb 2013 (not long after its release) it was the largest and fastest MicroSD available at the time, and it weighed in at a good price and backed up by SanDisk reputation.For me, and my Galaxy S3 {SCH-i535, currently with Android 4.3} this card has been a delightful slam dunk on all four counts.  I was reminded of this today when I slammed 30+gb of MP3's from my PC onto my S3's card.  The card handled the massive data dump with grace and aplomb, and I'm now able to use my phone to wirelessly stream my entire music library to my new bluetooth-compatible bookshelf stereo.Color me very satisfied.",
"They're nice cards. They're fast, come from a reputable brand, hold 32GB in a card the size of a fingernail, and really don't cost that much anymore. There are several brands of cards you can choose from, but I always liked SanDisk. I haven't had issues with their products.Also, the red and gray branding on the card makes it a bit easier to spot the card in case you drop it or leave it somewhere.",
"This is a great buy for music, news and any kind of information you want.",
I used these in a home brew project where speed was a major driving factor.  I used two of these in a raid adapter and they were just awesome.,
Transfer speeds from just moving files to my phone as well as rooting and adding various roms was much faster than I'm used to. I haven't done any official benchmarking though.,
"This is quite the steal! As already pointed out, the total value is 144.97. At the 99.99 price, this is a great deal. I was able to use the recent Prime 30 off offer to get this for 69.99. I bought this to have a Kindle to keep in my bag. My regular Kindle is the Voyage, but I've owned several other Kindles (K3 to Oasis). I compared the two screens with the same setup and the only thing I noticed is that the curve of the letters is sharper on the Voyage, but that was expected. Does it have a frontlight No... but as long as you know what to expect, you shouldn't be surprised. :) No light, no buttons but it also isn't advertised to have those features.",
"I'm writing this review with the benefit of being an experienced Kindle Fire user vs. someone brand new to the Kindle family. In summary, for 139 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and last year's Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend this regular Fire HD vs. a more expensive version. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire to last year's Fire HD but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of previous models of the Fire, setup took a while: despite being a brand new product, the Fire attempted to download and install several operating software updates. You just need to be patient while it downloads and installs.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has a great screen display and looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching an episode of The Lost Ship. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model.Read more",
This may be the worst memory card I've ever purchased - and I have bought a lot of card over the years - wish I had just stuck with my ADATA cardsFirst issue - I lost a bunch of photos - they just did not exist at all - it was as if I never took them  - but since there was a large gap in the file names I know for sure I didOf 200 photos taken about 40 in the middle just disappearedi could not even recover them using a deep scan toolI've been shooting digital since the mid 90s and this is the first time anything like this has ever happenedThen there is the cheesy SD adapter - the switch was so loose it switched to locked while I was taking pictures.Luckily the camera warned me that the card was read only - after having already taken a bunch of shots that has saved without issueFinally I figured I could just use these in my Samsung phones - no such luck - the second I put them in and took a photo I got an error that it could not right to the card and I could no longer see the 8gig of photos that were on itYes this may be a know issue with the cards - I see a review mentioned that - and I see that SanDisk will replace them - but they cannot replace the photos I lost - so keep that in mind when considering this card - I will,
I got this for my smartphone after a steep price drop. Pleased that it is working as expected.  No signs of memory failure.,
This card is awesome. I take a picture on my camera and phone and it is almost instantly ready to take another picture. The transfer between my laptop and phone is very quick as well it almost match my USB 3.0 speed. Also i really like the color of the card. it makes the micro sd card look very unique. Although if you have verizon you may get confused between the LTE card and micro sd card.,
"Love the new Kindle! Priced right (with an extra 20 off!), even smaller in my hands than the Kindle with keyboard. I was sad to lose my old Kindle, but this one is just terrific.",
Use this on my phone to watch HQ videos or run apps off of and unlike lower class (non HC) cards this one never stutters.,

The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
Memory cards arrived on time and I was greatly appreciative of the frustration free packaging. If people would only stop stealing the stuff off shelves then we wouldn't have to deal with the frustration free packing would we!Trued it out in my Samsung smartphone and it worked without a hitch.,
Great device I use it on a regular basis. good investment,
My Samsung Galaxy S4 seemed to take to it right away.  It snapped into place without issue and began working without formatting question.,
Good value for product. I wanted 64 GB to put all my music on my phone.  Easily transferred from from hard disk to microSD via USB cable.,
"I love this card. It provides a massive storage boost for my tablet, and has really fast access speeds. I have never run into loading problems, even with very large video files, and am happy with its performance.",
This does just what you need a card to do. We use this one in our Galaxy S4 and she is a strong performer. No complaints and highly satisfied.,
"As a heavy music listener, the SanDisk Ultra has been my most reliable storage of music files that feeds my mp3 players.  STILL VERY RELIABLE AS EVER!",
I mean it's a 64gb memory card. The price was right (caught a sale) and its a big ole memory card. I like SanDisk and haven't had any trouble!,
"Okay, if you don't want to read my whole review, I'll summarize it right here: The Oasis is the most technologically advanced e-ink reader that Amazon - or anyone else, for that matter - has produced to date. But is it worth 290 for the least expensive version (wi-fi only with ads) In my opinion, the answer is no, not when the very capable Paperwhite is available for 100 (at the time I'm writing this). But I'm sure that there is a market for the Oasis, probably for the techno-geeks and gadgeteers like myself who love trying new products like the Oasis, and serious readers who want the absolute best possible experience in reading. But for the typical reader, I just don't think the Oasis adds enough to the reading experience to be worth the high price, especially for those who already have a Paperwhite or Voyage.For reference, here's a brief comparison of the Oasis with the Paperwhite and the Voyage:Oasis (2016)-----------------------------Size: 5.6x4.8x0.13-0.33 (thickness varies)Weight (wi-fi version): 4.6 ounces (without battery case)Display: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED front-litStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: Touchscreen plus page turn buttonsNumber of fonts: 9Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lighting (10 LEDs)Third Generation Paperwhite (2015)------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.Read more",
"Lotsa space, man. Observed writing speed is between 10MB to 7MB on my dedicated USB2 card reader. I wrote mostly music on it for my Android phone. Speed only matters for faster writing.",
"I have lot of these at work 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB. Though I haven't done real speed tests on these, but these have been reliable all along. Used in music players, cameras, laptop SD Cards. These do sell at a little bit of premium because of their Class 10 tag, but I would buy these any day, if I need these for cameras/laptop extra storage. But if you are using these for music players, you are good even with Class 2 cards.",
"Never had a failure with SanDisk like other mfgrs.  I use this in my smartphone, comes with an SDHC adapter.  When smartphone makers stop including a micro-sd slot, I'll simply use this in my camera or laptop.",
I got this for my new phone. It works as expected. I don't worry about the speed in these things. I loaded up all my music on it & my phone stores my pictures on it. So far I have not had any issues with this micro sd card.,
"Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version. For my 7 version review, please search for my HDX 7 review.My profile: Im a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do. It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more",
We bought this product to compliment our other amazon product for its portability.,
"Major fan, didn't buy this because of protection, bought it cause it will blend in to my decor. It is not a skin, so it's not skin tight. Yes it's loose but how often will you grab it and move it. Me maybe once every year.",
Brand new card working perfectly good.  Using it with my action cameras: Gopro Hero3 and Contour GPS.  No problem so far!,
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
"This actually came with the SD adapter making it a great buy. Lots of memory, MicroSD, SD and cheap. Can't go wrong.",
"Exactly as advertised. Works well, well known brand and I paid a fair price.",
Too,
title pretty much covers it.bought it for my GoPro - with free 2 day delivery (with membership) and the price it was a no-brainer,
This is the third one I bought every kids fire tablet needs one.,
"No problems and works for what it is, would buy again and recommend without any hesitations, good product. and value.",
"I had bought this card for my new Samsung Galaxy S3. The card is about as good as you can expect for the price and technology you're paying for.SDXC cards come formatted in exFAT by default, which is what I would have tried to format it as anyway and seen if my phone supports that filesystem. In addition to being a faster format, enabling higher transfer rates, exFAT also takes up less storage space than, say, an FAT or FAT32 filesystem would - which is important when considering mobile storage devices.I read several poor reviews about this product starting that it simply stopped working after a few months. While that can happen from regular use, as it has happened to me in the past with a couple 32GB SDHCs, I would venture to say it was an error in use. Flash media is very sensitive in regards to ""hard shutdowns"". that's to say, just pulling it out of your device or card reader without first unmounting it. Within the 'Data Storage' menu on Android phones, there is an option to 'unmount SD card'. I would recommend that you ALWAYS select this before removing any external memory card to avoid corruption of data and, ultimately, the card itself. The reason for this is that sudden stoppage of a flash memory device's data or power connectivity can easily result in corruption.Transversely, if you have the memory card plugged into a card reader, say, with an SD adapter; you should first ""Eject"" the card. In Windows, there is a small icon located in the taskbar notification menu for ""Safely Remov[ing] Hardware and Eject[ing] Media"". Select the card and a notification will pop-up that the card is now safe to remove. It basically severs the same function as the Android 'unmount' optional but will also cease any current read/write operations to avoid data or device corruption.I cannot speak for how one would do this on a Mac OS but chances are, if you're using an Apple PC, you don't have an Android phone.",
The micro card also comes with an adaptor to allow use as a SD card.  I used it to increase memory in a cell phone and it worked perfectly.,
"Got this for my girlfriend for the tablet I bought her, she love this as she can now put all the music and pictures on her tablet that she wants and doesn't have to worry about running out of space anymore.",
What's to be expected,
"Does it's job. Not much to say.  It's SanDisk, so you know it's pretty much the standard for consumer-level flash-based data storage.",
"So far its been fine, no problems other than when installed phone only read 59.45GB instead of the 64 GB, thats the reason I'm only giving it 4 stars.  If anyone can give me a answer why it only read 59 instead of the 64 please let me know!",
"it works and it is just as fast as it is supposed, stores pictures as fast as I can click.",
Could not ask for anything more. It is exactly as advertised and I have no issues. I have not gotten to try it in a UHS device yet but cannot wait to do so.,
"Good product that is working well, was packaged well and delivered as promised. It was a birthday gift for my sons laptop",
Work perfectly in my camera. Reads and writes fast.,
Like a previous reviewer mentioned it is fabric over hard plastic it is not a snug or tight fit. Good quality though.,
"I purchased the original Kindle Fire on release day last year. It served me pretty well but was extremely glitchy. It would freeze, restart and stutter while playing games. For what it was, an entry level device, it wasnt bad.So when the Kindle Fire HD was released, I decided I might as well give it a go as well. So far the Kindle HD looks to be twice the machine the original was. I am gonna keep this short and sweet and just create a pros and cons list for you guys. I dont want to be too long winded, but if you have questions you post in the comments, I will try to respond to them for a little while today.PROS:1. Vibrant Screen2. Much more responsive to the Touch than the original Kindle ever was.3. Games that stuttered on the Original, play flawlessly on the HD.4. The speakers are awesome, Loud, clear and crisp. No need for the Volume + app like on the original fire.5. The device is slim, sleek and sexy. Really like the curves on the back and the styling.6. Front facing camera works great for SKYPE. Quality was better than that on my SIII phone.7. Wifi seems a bit faster, but not by much. Silk still isnt an optimal browser though. I have 65Mbps Download and 15Mbps Upload subscribed service.8. Cloud sync worked like a charm, almost everything from my old fire is now on my new Fire HD.9. The device feels sturdy and well built.CONS:1. The Customers Also Bought on the bottom of the home screen is terrible. I can care less about what others bought. The advertisements on the Lock Screen are fine and understandable, they really dont bother me at all or with the function of the device.Read more",
I find San Disk always to be a good choice for storage options. Capacity and performance are always top notch.,
Very simple to format and use.  Excellent storage.  Buy it along with a 3.0 compatible USB  microcard adapter for downloading to 3.0 capable computer.  Makes for very fast and hassle free transfer of your pictures.,
"Works on my Samsung Note 3, and for such a great price.  Fast, holds a lot of data, no need to go any where else.",
"failed in one month.  Sandisk very promptly replaced, great customer service, and the new card seems to work ok.  I have read that there are some problems with the galaxy s3 so it may not have been the memory module's fault it failed.",
"I own the Merlot cover since it came with my Kindle Oasis. After paying near 300 for device and original cover I was hoping replacements would eventually come out. So when they did....I saw the 90 price tag and immediately became saddened. This was probably already in the works but, it was an idea I submitted to Amazon when I made my original purchase. The price is simply outrageous! The case itself is amazing. It looks good, smells good, and feels good. But, I can't afford this!",
This is a awesome product. My husband and I love it.,
I ordered these to work in my GoPro Hero3 Black and they have worked well. They came with an SD memory card adapter - perfect for my high speed card readers.,
These cards work well with many of our pieces of electronic equipment when we travel.  The price was perfect and none failed. They also worked with the readers we had.,
"Can't comment on reading speeds, but my flac audio files run smoothly on Sansa. Sandisk have never failed, in other cards so I assume this will hold up to that, if not, I'll update.",
What can you say about a memory card. I took it out of the package. I put it in my GoPro. I turned the GoPro on and everything worked.,

"class 10 is about the best there is and SanDisk hasn't let me down, except that one time when a lock/unlock broke off of a 32gig SDHC card I once bought. Well, out of about a hundred different memory cards I'de say that ain't a bad run. This works GREAT in my son's/wife's touch pad. If you can get one on sale they are GREAT!",
"Disappointing Kindle.Charging is sometimes interrupted by loss of connection between cover and Kindle. Complained and they sent me another cover. It works better, but still looses connectivity from time to time. Have to stop and disconnect cover and reconnect it. That usually stops the problem for a while.Also, It is not clear from the sales materials that the Premium Leather cover is suede. it shows scratches from fingernails.On the plus side, the Oasis screen is good and the quality of the text is excellent. Lighting is even and reading is easy on this device.",
"I bought this for my garmin virb action cam.  It will store 6-7 hours of video, which is great because that's all my batteries will record.  It's fast and big, what more can you want!",
I bought it to expand the memory on a cheap Android tablet. It is recognized and works fine. No problems.,
its perfect and easy to use and conect fast to the camera its give you 9940 photo and 45m video with sony cam 18mp,
"Beware guys. i bought one of these from Superior Electronics Outlet and it arrived completly dead. i tried to format it on windows and on my galaxy s3 and no go.I tried everything that possible ....have been fighting with this card for 3 days now, and no success so far. No response from the seller about it.My last hope is amazon refund me. otherwise  i just wasted 80 U$",
What can you say about a disk. It is doing the work that it was made to do. I am happy with it.,
"Does everything it says without a hitch.  Works like a charm and reasonably priced, which makes it a good value too.",
Really helpful I needed to backup some photos and there was plenty of space left,
"I tend to hold my reviews until I test things thoroughly. Is 2 years is thorough enough? Works, no issues. stated capacity, good speeds.",
I've heard bad things about this 64gb Micro SD card crapping out after a few weeks but sk far so good. Transfer speeds are normal but I like to be space. For the price it was a steal!Would recommend.,
Fast as it gets. Even in my phone this thing rocks! In a camera you can almost slow down time itself.,
"Major fan, didn't buy this because of protection, bought it cause it will blend in to my decor. It is not a skin, so it's not skin tight. Yes it's loose but how often will you grab it and move it. Me maybe once every year.",
This item was purchased for my smart phone and the sale price was excellent. The item arrived intact and on time and works great.,
Great price! works flawless with my note 3. I love it!!! So glad I purchased this memory card. A must have to expand your memory on your phone.,
"So far this card has worked well. No glitches or dropouts. It is recognized by everything so far; work computer, home computer, camera. Not a problem yet.",
Very quick and no problems what so ever. A great storage platform and works great in both my Lenovo tablet and my Samsung phone. I would recommend this to anyone =),
Used it in an android phone. Worked fine and is decently fast. It did not quite reach the rated speeds but came close (could just be the controller that I am using).,
"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysJuly 30, 2014Hi Dallas, thank you for sharing your feedback.

The card came, I formated it and installed it.  Rebooted the phone and it works... Phone was able to see new extpned storage and worked right away.  Its an awesome card - fast read and write.  Highly recommanded for anyone looking to expend their degital storage.Chers!",
"I use it for HD video recording, It work very well, no frame lost since I use this card. I have no measured the actual transfer rate, but it looks to be very fast when reading the movies from the SD, and I have no frame lost since I use this card.",
"If this was any more worthless, it would have a retched stench.  This card has completely turned me away from ever trusting another SanDisk product again.  I would only use this in the future to keep corrupt mis-information to frustrate anyone attempting to acquire any of my data.I have reformatted it 3-4 times IN FULL using various allocation sizes and operating systems.  It only functions under Windows, it randomly works in my mobile devices.  Now i'm left to decide if I want to bother researching this to better understand the problem in the future, or simply purchase another card from a more reliable manufacturer...... hello Kingston.",
"The class is how fast the memory is read.  This is a fast card.  There are faster out there, but they are far more expensive, and not worth that expense, in my opinion.  Does everything perfectly and in a compact package.  SanDisk is a brand name, and trusted by me.  Worth the extra buck, since I've used SanDisk since they made 8MB CF cards&#8230;how far we have come&#8230;",
"I bought two pieces and they were working well, but after filling one of them with videos, the entire card just failed. I was unable to reformat it, even by using Partition Magic. Otherwise the other one is working just fine.",
Got this for my samsung galaxy s4 and its super nice to have. The space allows me to fit so much on this phone that it can hold everything I want. Had an entire season of Seinfeld on there for those boring times and lots and lots of music. Great buy,
"Gave it 4 stars because I don't know if the problem is the card or the phone.  I have an intermittant problem where the phone stops recognizing it.  But it's fast, and holds a lot.  I would recommend it.Update:  Had intermittant issues with my phone (galaxy s3).  Finally gave up the ghost completely, computer won't recognize it at all.  I don't think I had any important data on it.  I would take it up with SanDisk, as another reviewer indicated that they replaced his over issues in his phone, but my computer can't even recognize it to wipe it so I'm not sending it anywhere.",
"Bought this for my S3 and loaded it with 4 seasons of Futurama, 5 full length HD movies, several documentaries, and a dozen or so 30 minute comedy shows with plenty of room left over for pictures, etc...Only slight nitpick is when booting up into recovery mode on the S3 it will not recognize the card. Wanted to update the phone to the latest version of Android and it would not see it. Had to resort to a 2GB MicroSD I had laying around. That wasn't a SD card issue but I thought I would throw that in.",
"For starters, there are only a few of the free Prime shows listed. There should be a section where all of the prime shows are placed and easy to find. Shows should only be listed once and then after clicking the show artwork the seasons available. 150 shows are all spread out so it is annoying having to go through them all. Show seasons aren't even together. It is a mess that needs to be sorted. Yes, there is voice search but, if you don't know what Prime videos are available you could spend days trying to find something to watch...or, just give up and go to Netflix. I bought this because it sounded like it would be better than my Roku. I am not yet convinced it is, I know it is early in its release so, I will give the developer a little time to fix the problems. Main problem is lack of Prime videos and storage is limited so probably won't use it for games. I am on my second day of owning this box an already it is telling me there is a problem loading videos. The screen saver pictures are nice though. Also, we should be able to attach an external USB drive to download movies and music we buy. I have several movies we bought from Amazon but, they only allow downloading them to Windows PC. So Apple users are better served buying videos from ITunes until this policy changes.",
"As advertised, specs match.  As long as the device you as using it in can handle it (i.e. USB 3.0, not some crapple bs) it delivers the advertised speed.  P.S. The speed is READ, not WRITE, but you knew that, right?",
The SD card arrived quickly and has worked ever since initial install. I have removed and used in adapter for laptop and put back in without issue. I'm using on Droid Razr M and always select unmount option in storage section prior to removal to ensure data is not lost. I have no complaints with this item. i bought this card to replace a 32GB card I purchased previously and suddenly stopped working. I paid a little more but some things are well worth it. I put a lot of MP3 files on my device so this card is great.,
"very happy, good product and quality, works fine does the job. i use it with my android it is fast and reliable",
This is a really great micro SD card! I purchased one for my Samung Tablet and another one for digital video.,
"The more I use this, the more reasons I enjoy it. The staff were great and helped me set it up.",
"Is, what it says it is! Great chip, fast, reliable. 6 months so far, not a single problem, and lots of handling too!",
"SanDisk has always been a reliable brand for me, their products typically outlast the devices they were paired with.  This cards is decently fast, writing speed is able 10mb, and read is in the 24-6 range, it is plenty fast for HD video.",
"great product at an affordable price!  there's just no messing with sandisk quality, and with 64 gigs you'll have plenty of room to store anything and everything you want!",
"It's a micro sd hc, stores files, and is great at it.I don't really know enough about these kinda things to go into details of how fast it is at transfering files.But it worked great for copying video files from my computer, placing the same thing into my LED tv (has a USB port) and watching the files from there. 8gb video files would play perfectly fine. Perhaps that's saying enough about it? Worth the money!",
"Many have complained that the hero3 requires a high quality mSD card. Picked up this one for a great price on Amazon, and have not had any issues with my camera freezing up or not recording as desired. Transfer rates were as advertised. Also loaded it at one point with 30 or so xvid movies for my daughters to watch on an ASUS epad transformer and it worked perfectly. Highly recommend.",
"buy this one. it was inserted in my galaxy note 2, and also my asus transformer infinity. i bought 2 of these cards. i will buy it again if i need to. its easy to install, just pop it in and your device reads it. it's that simple!",

"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",
"I would recommend this memory card to anyone that has a  cell phone, or a tablet pc.  This memory card is fast and efficient.",
This works perfect in my Dell Venue Pro 8. All I had to do was to reformat the card before using it.,
I use this on my small ASUS 10.1&#34; notepad to get a little extra storage space.  Installs well and works great.  Just be sure you orient it right when inserting it without and adapter to protect it in a small slot like the one that comes with the ASUS.

"Failed after one month and the problem is epidemic on the sandisk forums , they slowly get corrupted then fail and report only 30-32mb size.The Lifetime warranty is nice, but these products are clearly defective , I'm in the process of RMA now, will update post on status updates.DO NOT TRUST YOUR DATA WITH THIS PRODUCT, KEEP A BACKUP OF EVERYTHING YOU PUT ON IT, I'M 100% serious, just look at the sandisk 'users' forum for 64gb cards.Here is my breakdown while it lastedSanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1Write speed  was 8-10 Mb/s (usually 8, tested windows usb 3.0 reader, and android)Read speed 27 mb/sFAILED @ 1 1/2 monthsUpdate 2-13-14Received back replacement item in brand new condition readspeed is 40+mb/s write speed is still around 10-12mb/s - RMA turn around time was about 3 weeks, I will up rating if this one lasts longer then one month.Update 5-1-14RMA replacement is still going strong, upped the star rating by one point.",
No problems at all using this in my Samsung Galaxy S III. Fit right in and started working. I would suggest this to anyone,
I wait for flash media sales to purchase SD card (various sizes).  I got the 64GB size for my GoPro 3+ and it works great.  I see no issues with the speed.  The price/GB was great on these.  Best of all this has been completely reliable for me.  No complaints whatsoever.,
"Love having the wireless tap to use anywhere. It's small, sound is good. charges up quickly. Bough the sling to protect it outside.",
"This seems to be a great MicroSDXC, as I would expect from SanDisk.  I have not tested read/write speed so I cannot comment on that.  I have it installed in my Lenovo ThinkPad 8 to provide extra storage, and it is doing what it is supposed to do.  Guess there is not much more you can say about an SD card.  I would expect it to work just as well in any device that is SDXC compatible.",
"Transfer speeds are amazing, never corrupts files like my old card and it has tons of space! 64gb is really a bunch, spesh for music lovers like myself, itndelivers on recording capabilties too, does not dissapoint. I get a steady 15mb/s transfer which is well over the 6mb/s i was getting with my old class 6. Higjhly recommemd. I got mine for $41 with prime shipping. AND YES THEY WORK IN THE GALAXY S3/S4/S2, DROID RAZR/XT912/HD/MAXX/MAXXHD, WII U, you just have to format it properly. On stock format you get the full 30+ mb/s transfer speeds, yes. But through your phomes which is only LIMITED TO ITS HARDWARE you get half that. Youre only limited to what the hardware can handle. Thats why they recommemd the 32gb cards as its differect architecture. People complain about the speeds using programs. Psh, my new usb 3 car reader tells me i get 60mb/s transfer rates! So stuff it!Excellent card, excellent quality. I threw it in a cup of ice water and stirree it up in front of my friends and let it sit for an hour while i drank the water and played video games. Then took it out and dried it off and let it sit for a minute or two to warm up, threw it back in my phone and to everyones amazement..it still worked. SOLD. hahaBoht two, looking to buy 2 more, now if amazon would only drop the price to $40 again.",
"memory card failed mysteriously overnight, not sure why, but phone works fine with a different card.here, four more words",
and good product.  I haven't had any issue with the San Disk memory cards so I prefer to stay with them.  I have several electronic devices what use the micro SD and they all work great.  I would recommend this product.,
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
Works just fine in my Galaxy S4.  No problems.  Unbelievable how much storage you can get in such a small space and for such a low price.,
The price for this 64GB micro SD card is excellent compare to retail. The card is reliable with no issues at all. I bought one for my Samsung Note 8 tablet and Samsung Galaxy S4!,
I bought this micro card to use in a security camera for continuous recording. It works perfectly and is the ideal size for all night surveillance. The San Disk name offers confidence in quality.,
I work for Ready 2 Roll Pedicabs in Houston and we do a lot of promotional movies and put them on YouTube. We use this memory card for our full HD cam... So far we recorded 5 hour on full HD and still have plenty of space for more hours. It just took a few day when I received it in the mail.,
"This has really just been used to store some extra files and pass between computers. It came with the converter to change it to a standard SD card. No issues with either. It always amazes me how so much data can be stored in such a small space. Anyway, it will get more use in the next month. I'm planning on upgrading phones and will knock it down a star if it seems to slow to record video to. So if you just see 5 stars, it means I am lazy and the disk is still good.",
"I figured out why my old microSD card died on me.  When I plugged in my old Android phone at work, the antivirus software of my laptop wanted to scan the whole thing every time.  I was plugging it in to charge it, but the constant reads wore out the flash.  My new Android phone mounts as a CD drive (instead of the entire thing). I can only see the phone if I unmount my CD drive.  This is perfect for charging at work now.  Be careful with virus scanners if you have an Android phone that auto mounts your entire phone's Micro SD!",
"Originally got the walnut cover with my Oasis. It's very nice, and I would describe it as a suede material. For me, the walnut cover didn't age well. Lots of scratching, which is' necessarily a bad thing, but it also seemed to darken a bit which made it a bit dirty. The merlot cover is also very nice and ages a whole lot better. After some months of use, it looks as good today as when I first bought it. Oasis covers in general are very functional. The 2nd battery in the cover is genius. Since I found I really like reading my Oasis without the cover, I love the easy on/off design of the case.",
able to capture 1080p full Hd on my blackberry z10 now.  with my other card i was only able to do 720,
"Why is you buy a 16GB card and when you install it, you have only 14.8 GB? Exactly where does that 1GB+ I PAID FOR...go to?",
"I purchased two of these for my wife's and my phone. We've had no issues whatsoever with formatting and placing files onto this card. You really can't go wrong with this purchase, except if the price is a bit too much.",
We now have one for everyone in the family and no longer share. I would have no problem recommending this to a friend.,
No comment - bought for a friend.  No comment - bought for a friend  No comment - bought for a friend.,
"I use this for a dash mounted camera for my company car. It is constantly recording and erasing old videos when the card is full. It has been used for nearly 2 years, including cold winters and hot summers, and has never messed up.",
"I have this card in my Samsung Galaxy III.It has been in there now for about 8 months with no issues.Okay, it had one issue but that was the phone design itself. It would un-mount if the phone was moved around roughly. It seems to pop out very easy in the Samsung Galaxy phones. So I solved the problem by putting some electrical tape on it to hold it in. So far after 8 months it hasn't un-mounted.It will give you an ungodly amount of storage on this phone. If your wondering if your Samsung Phone will take this card - it will with no issues. It shows a total of 59.6 GB of available space once installed. A must have since most phones come with 8 GB of internal memory nowadays.",
"Just another 16 gb micro memory card.  Quality build and on sale, the cheapest around.",
"I assumed, based on the product description, that access to 40,000 Songs meant that I could play my own 2800 songs on the cloud that I also pay Amazon a couple hundred dollars a year for. Why not a cloud player app for crying out loud. If I'm mistaken and I CAN access my cloud music, I sure appreciate it if somebody could tell me how. That's why I bought it. I might return it because I can already get everything by Amazon's own content through other means. Kind of a drag that I can't play my AMAZON PURCHASED music through my expensive home theater. I couldn't care less about viewing my Amazon cloud photos on my home theater.",
Pretty good sound for the size and configuration of speaker. Easy to set up.,
Bought 3 of these cards to use for using in my digital camera. They all worked great and was able to pop right in to either my phone of my tablet as they only take microSD cards. Use for regular pictures and HD video without any problems. Speed does not seem to be any problem as people who bought other cards from other manufacturers. SanDisk is the only card that I recommend using.,
I bought this with my GoPro+ Black Edition. I've been using the product for a little over a month. I don't have a lot of experience with different Micro SD's as this is the only product that I own right now that uses MicroSD. It does exactly what it is supposed to so far: stay out of the way. I rarely even think about it because it just works.,
Works great in the phone and it had no issues installing it.Great price and works well for the price,
"Functions perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy Tab II.  No issues with slow processing times.  Great product, I highly recommend this memory card for tablets.",
"Works great in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Hold a lot of data files, photos, and apps.  I may never use the full capacity of this reliable microSDXC Class 10 card.",
"Does what it says. Hasn't broken yet, and I hope it doesn't break. I've had luck with this brand before. Usually get bored with the product before it breaks.",
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
After purchasing several SDHC from other sources I was almost ready to give up.  Each of those was somehow defective.  The Amazon SDHC is genuine and works like a charm.,
Pluggesd in the MicroSd csrd and it worked perfectly!  SanDisk has a solid performer here.  I'd recommend this product to anyone neededing this level of storage and speed.,
"Excellent, one of the best, can't go wrong with this card, class 10 is necessary and shows noticeable but not significant improvements over class 4",
I use this speaker daily and love the sound quality and its ability to be independant of my phone/tablet unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that require your phone to play music even if they have the same sound quality.,
"Worked immediately after I inserted.29.71 GB recognized, doesn't really bug me but I wish I got the full 32.",
This puts me at about 80 GB on my phone.  I will be purchasing more of these as needed for other devices.,
"I bought this card as an addition to my 32 GB Galaxy Note 3. I have well over 32 GB that I use for music with scads left over for apps and movies. You may never need this much space, but some of you are like me and we WANT this much space. With my 3.0 USB the transfer speeds are very adequate. Can't wait for the 256 GB ;)",
"SanDisk does not disappoint, this is exactly as described, arrived on time and is plenty of storage for all my photos, music playlists, and still leaves room for movies as well.",
"I have this in my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and love it. It houses all of my music and pictures without issue. It does seem like R/W speed is a bit slow, but really can't complain.",
"Purchased this card to expand the storage on my Samsung S4 and it does the trick.  Plenty of room to carry ebooks, music and store camera pictures.  Great item at a good price and I recommend this item for anyone needing more memory using a microSDHC Class 10 Memory Card.",
"I've seen several recent reviews complaining about not getting any packaging with their SD cards.  One person even questioned if the card was new or not.  Amazon offers &#34;frustration-free&#34; packaging for many of their products where they take care of opening it for you, then they repack it in plain brown cardboard to make it easier on the consumer.  This card has the option to come in the retail packing, or in amazon's &#34;frustration-free&#34; packaging.  It's an ordering option, and it seems this option defaults on &#34;frustration-free&#34;.If you order the retail packaging option, it will look just like it does on the store shelves.",
"This speaker has a great sound and its perfect to take out on the patio or in any room that I am in. The tap is annoying compared to the Echo with voice activation, but the wireless features makes the purchase worth it.",
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
"works.  its an SD card, what did you want some kind of essay explaining the depths of flash memory.  No, you didn't.  And you've probably heard of sandisk, so you know its probably reliable.  the only reason you're looking at the reviews... *sigh*... why are you looking at the reviews of a microSD card?  seriously...  take a break, get off the computer and go for a walk.  i'm for real.  you know i'm right.",
"I love that you can get these things so cheap from Amazon, vs. getting them at the major electronic stores for double the price.  It works perfectly, and streams/downloads/uploads very quickly!  I love the adapter that comes with it, too; so I can use it for transferring files from a computer/notebook faster than a 3.0 USB/Thumbdrive/dongle.  Great buy!",
Needed this to be able to update my Garmin with Canada and Europe maps. Did the job and at a great price.,
It has such a large storage capacity in such a small package. Store all your photos and data on this.,
when I got my phone I didn't know about 6GB out of the 16GB would not have been available to me from the start because of its operating system and all the software that was pre installed so I used this to get more than enough memory for my phone and it works great I have all my music a few movies and all my pictures and all my ebooks on it,
"This is one of those products that either works or it doesn't (which rarely happens), so what can I say.  It work's great.  32 GB allows plenty of room for storage in my tablet, and with the high rate transfer speed apps run as quickly as if they were using internal memory storage.",
works as advertised. Using this with Q10 which supports only 32gb. So far no issues. totally happy with the purchase.,
Works fine on my android phone..seems fast when transferring from the computer..but with could be faster still..don't know if there is anything faster..so I am happy with it..would recommend,
"works great so far, but gopro filled the card pretty quick recording at 1080p. So I got a 64GB a week later.",
"Bought this to expand storage in my Windows 8 tablet.So far, so good. (Minor point, the microSD slot on the T100TA is a bit too &#34;shallow&#34;, so the card protrudes slightly - keep that in mind if buying this card for that tablet.)",
It is what it is and it works as required and is very fast in processing the data.  In the 2 weeks I've had it it hasn''t crashed.  :-),
"Got the SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-A on December 28, 2012, died on May 20, 2013Could not write to it or change any data, no matter what device i used. Even after format (Full & Quick using disk manager & EaseUS Partition Master 9.1.1 Home Edition, connected in a device or adaptor or usb adaptor) when disconnected and reconnected no change. Dropbox saved my data luckily (Had it syncing using Dropsync Pro).Was using it with Samsung Galaxy Note 2 T889 for the whole time, never was removed.",
I love the product!This is only a place you can review the product - not the handing! The handling sucked - the product is great!,
Used in a tablet computer. Works great. May buy more for my digital camera. I liked the specs on this C10/UHS1.,
"I have nothing bad to say about these little guys! They arrived as expected, they fit into the devices and they work as stated! :D",
"I like this 32 GB micro memory card, it has a lot oF storage space for videos and photos.  I use it in my Spy Camera Mini Clock Radio.",
Huge capacity and recognized without a hitch on galaxy s3. Reasonably fast card with huge amounts of storage for a good price.,
The product met my expectations (I expected it would go in my S3.) That's about all there is to say.,
A scan disc is a standard thing however the price for this 32GB was a good deal and the shipping was quick. This was a good buy would definitely recommend !,
"Always Buy More Memory is my new rule. This memory card is easy to use and captures loads of video, but you do need to download every PM. Works fine with my Mac, have not used it with a PC.",
"So far, no complaints. Excited about the price. Excited about the size. I only hope my files won't get erased randomly. I will try to update this in a few weeks.",
"Formatted in computer, popped in phone and bingo bango Bob's your uncle. Phone recognized right away and I had music transferred in minutes.",
"It is a memory card, fast as any other class10 card, and SanDisk units rarely lose data.  I wish these guys would keep their marketing on the backside leaving some white space on top so we could write things.  The cheapo-brands do this but not the big guys - idiots.",
"It's fast, its small, its pretty cheap.  I put one in a usb reader to use as a thumb drive.",
"Bought this to expand my storage space on both my Galaxy S4 and a Surface tablet with Windows RT. Performed very well on both, transferring small files can take a while but I have no problems recording video in HD with my phone. Totally recommend it, and it's the largest card both of this devices will take.",
"I've just plugged and play on my Galaxy S3.It is very cheap for extra 64 Gb. (If you want the same on an i-phone, you'll pay US$ 100 per 16 Gb, with a 2 year contract with your carrier).I do not remember the last time I downloaded the pictures to my PC...I took hundreds of 8MP pictures and a bunch of full HD videos, I have around 30.000 mp3 and I still have space.I just love it!",
What can you say beyond the headline.  It works as expected.  I would buy more when I need reliable storage.,
This is not the same remote that I got for my Alexa-Echo it doesn't control volume.... I think remotes most used feature is volume and pause. I would be disappointed with myself if i produced a remote that couldn't control volume. That would make me an incompetent engineer or lazy CEO!!! Amazon I expect better from you!!!,
This item is what it is; I've been using it for a few months now and it records HD videos in my GoPro Hero3 without problems.,
Not a whole lot to report other than the card has been working great so far in my S4.  No problems whatsoever.,
"This brand has proven to be reliable and easy to work with. It is versatile for use in my Android devices as well as cameras. Nothing is permanent and I try to have a back up of my files, but it has served me well for a couple of years.",
"Works great in my BlackBerry Z10. Holds all I need and it is fast. I really wish there was more to say, but I can't think of Anything. No cons.",
"Still not really in love with the new Kindle itself (on the fence about returning it), but this case is just horrid. It says it stands, it doesn't. It just collapses no matter position it's in. It's flimsy and scratchy and does just about nothing. Complete waste of money.",
This is a great card that does what it's supposed to do. I will definitely buy again when the need arises.,
"I'm thinking this must of been a fluke, it never worked. Had to return item but received full refund",
"Picked up several when they were discounted. work great in my Galaxy S4 phone, wifes Nikon V1 and my GoPro. No failures or inability to recognize card. Highly recommend ScanDisk products.",
"I've never had a problem with Sandisk memory products (I use their &#34;ultra&#34; compact flash for my other camera), and this one is cut from the cloth. A great product with no problems... I will continue to demand Sandisk!",
I bought this memory card for my GoPro. It does everything it is supposed to. It is fast enough to work with the camera and it is very reliable.,
"Fast, reliable, good brand name and customer service, top of line product. One thing to note is if you don't have a high end device then you don't need a class 10, a class 4 or 6 will yield you the same results. So keep that in mind.",
It works just fine and I'm thinking of getting a 64GB for my tablet later on.  I don't have too much more to say except buy!,
I have had some problems with it. I bought to replace the original cover that was chewed by my dog. I have had to restart my Kindle to get it to hold a charge which helped but the charge does not last as long as it did with my original cover.,
"UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more",

"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",

"I made the mistake of buying a supposed 64gig card on Ebay and found that it was fake. So, I decided to purposely buy a retail packaged SandDisk card directly from Amazon. The card is great, I reformatted it to fat32 for use with my Sansa clipzip and Hisoundaudio Studio V 3rd Anniversary. I have not had any problems with the card, works as advertised and the transfer speeds are great when loading files onto the card.",
great price size and speedyou cannot go wrong with this itemi have bought several of them already in different sizes,
"I got mine the day after it was unveiled. Out of the box it required an update. It's the fastest UI of any other box that I have. Currently there aren't as many apps as I would like to see, but I imagine they'll be coming soon.I am not able to get my Kindle Fire HDX to Mirror the display yet. It won't connect for some reason.Including more apps coming soon, apparently the Amazon Music app will be available soon as well. Games are very cool. I don't have the separate controller, but have had fun with the games you can play with the remote.These aren't mediocre games you would find on the Roku 3, but high quality mobile games. Of course the games aren't full on Xbox or PS4 style, but beautifully scaled mobile games you'd play on your smartphone or tablet.If you get your entertainment from the Amazon ecosystem, this is an excellent device.",
"Bought this a few months back for my phone... but after switching phones to one that didn't support extra storage I reformatted and stuck it on my car stereo full of music. Even at full capacity it has been there for months now playing without a hitch. Music only take about 5 seconds after starting the car to start playing, skipping, fast forwarding or searching all works flawlessly. The stereo is to be given some props here but if the card wasn't up to par it clearly wouldn't be as fast as it is. Very glad with the purchase. Will buy again if the need ever comes.",
"Bought a Windows Surface with 8 Pro. It has a 128GB SSD which is pretty good, but adding the card gives me 64GB of storage and backup that is nearly as fast as the SSD.",
This product works fast and is very reliable. The capacity is huge. I use it in my tablet and in my phone and can carry lots of pictures and videos. Highly recommended.,
Works great with the galaxy note 3 I didn't have to do anything but just pop it in the phone and the phone did the rest.,
"Like many here, mine failed and I lost my data (but being smart, I had a backup).  After further investigation, I found this product is NOT compatible with Android and a number of devices (cameras, phones, gps unit).  Windows seems to love it though.  Wish I had a windows device that could use 32G... my only one uses a whopping 100k at best.  What a Waste.UPDATE: Reformated is as FAT32 and works ok in my android devices and my Sony camera for about 3 months now.  Still, I keep a hot quick backup (OTA) every day to my desktop computer... I'll just say I'm not 100% confident in it yet.",
Good price for a good size micro SD.  Not the fastese card that I have used but for the price I am satisfied.,
"Works great in my Samsung S4 phone. Being class ten it is designed to write quickly, but somehow my phone's internal storage is faster: minus one star.I have been using this for about a month with zero data loss or other problems.",
"Using in a Surface Pro's microSD slot.  I even reformatted to NTFS (which they claim is not recommended) in order to set up a virtual disk file on it and 'automount' that virtual disk upon startup so that my music library can be on this (Win 8 is kind of picky about letting you set up what it considers 'removable' volumes as directories to be auto-scanned for libraries, and this is one workaround.)Amazing to me that something the size of my pinky nail can hold my entire music collection at a nice high bitrate, and still have much more room left over.  One star off because its a tiny bit slow to write to but that might not be fair since I'm comparing to full-size SD and I did reformat, as I said.",
"after doing some tests between a generic memory card and this sandisk i am very disappointed. i bought the 32 gig class (10) card.i swore i picked ""original packaging"" but it was shipped with out original packaging... i will be returning this card for the following reasons:these tests were done using the sd card ports on my pc.my generic class (6) 32 gig card has upload speed of 22MB (write) and a transfer speed of 8.5.my sandisk i just bought, it has an upload speed peaking at 32MB (write) and a transfer speed of 6.5 to maybe 8.5 if im lucky.the write speed is ok, but why is the transfer speed so much more low. why isnt it at least 10MB if not 12MB if sandisk is typically so modest in their classifications?and whats the deal with the no classification marking on this sd card... i dont see class (10) anywhere on this card....amazon you will be getting this back!",
Would recommend friends. Worked as expected and transfer is speedy. Always a fan of SanDisk where they make they product quality.,
i choose this card to eliminate worries when i travel far away from home . very quick and look so strong,
"I have been enjoying the amazon tap for two weeks, and am still finding new things it will do",
Better price than the Samsung branded card and works as well or better. Make sure that you check the requirements of the device that you have so you get the best card for your device.,
"Purchased this card for use with my new SLR camera as a backup.  Read/Write to the card is fast which allows maximum use of special modes available with the camera. Data transfer speeds to a computer are also good, no real complaints.  Overall a good SD card for the price.",
"Works flawlessly in a GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition. Great card for the price and fits plenty of footage, especially when you have 2 of them.",
"I will start by saying I do not really understand the whole &#34;class&#34; rating system of these cards. This is described as class 10, which to my minor research, is pretty fast at uploading and downloading data. And it seems to me to work just fine. Didn't take very long to upload some HD movies I had on my computer that I wanted on my phone. My thought with buying this was simply this.... Why short change myself? Ill just buy the biggest(capacity) and the alleged 'fastest' and by happy. And I am.",
"is everything I need, the best and faster microSD in market, exxecent choice I ordered 2, so I recomended It",
"Ok first things first, I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap.Now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the Tap was voice enabled like the Echo. I happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through. Because the Echo is not meant to be a mobile device. It generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have. But the Tap is meant to be mobile, and therefore I am happy it's not a Voice command device. I would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it. So I actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature. I have the Echo on my kitchen counter and the Tap in my Studio office. And when I leave my office I just grab it and go.I bought this on sale for 89 and I went to the store and listened to many Bluetooth speakers. And while yes the charge 3 sounds better, all the charge 3 can do is be a Bluetooth speaker. While the Tap is so much more for less . And the Tap sounds Great. After looking online I was a little nervous that it would not sound that great, but I was 100 wrong about that. There is no other product out there for 89 that sounds this good and can do what the Tap does.I was not paid or given a Tap to write this review. I'm just a consumer who was it the market for a Bluetooth speaker, and I could not be happier with my choice.Also if you buy this device buy the Amazon sling as well. Trust me you will want it. And honestly I am again happy I got the one that covers the bottom of the Tap. Because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink I would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed.That's it, that's all. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!",
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me.

"I've tried memory cards with really bad results. Finally decided to go with Sandisk. It may be a little bit more expensive than the others, but ultimately this is more reliable.",
"Used in GoPro as other user reviews indicated the 32 and 64 GB cards did not work well.  Just buy more of them, I recorded over 1000 photos and 60 minutes of video on each 16GB card.",
Its a small micro memory card that comes with a full size adapter. I am using it in action cameras and have had no issues with it. It transfers data quickly between the card and my PC with no problems.,
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
Fast and reliable.  Well worth the price.  Works in my android tablet 7.0 with no problems.  Setup was no problem.,
"Since I bought this card, I've been using it almost daily in my Hero 3 camera. The recordings are without any glitches so far.",
"Put the memory card in my Microsoft Surface RT and it worked fantastic. No formatting, no setup, it was ready to go right off the bat, plus the price was the best I could find anywhere.",
Does it's expected job. I use it in a dash cam video in my car and the quality is perfect.,
I purchased this card to double my disk space for my MS Surface RT. The price was right and I am happy with my purchase. I would recommend this card to anyone needing a 32GB MicroSD card.,
I can read a lot longer without pain in my hands since the cover holds it for me. Very nice shade of blue.,
"I slipped this into my smartphone. Lots of space for photos, and movies on the go at a great price.",
"I own a couple of these and I've tested them on several devices.  I use these cards mainly for my mobile devices.  The 64 gb has performed well on my galaxy note 2 and galaxy note 3.  I've tested the transfer rates and they are within the prescribed range.  These are not the fastest class 10 cards, but they are sufficient for storing pictures, movies, and songs. I'm able to play songs and movies off of the card without any delay at all.",

We're excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound, and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD. As you correctly point out, the new Kindle Fire HD is the successor to last year's entry level Kindle Fire, which does not include features such as camera, microphone, or HDMI port. You are also correct to point out that this device does not support Mayday, although there are still multiple ways to get help for free directly from your device. We hope you enjoy the new features and services. Thanks, The Kindle Team",
I bought this card to extend the storage capability of my tablet. It holds hundreds of my short video files without having to use the tablet's built in memory. Transfer speed from my computer into the card is relatively fast. If someday I may need more storage in the tablet I can always buy another one of these cards.,
I use this to store all my music pictures and HD video on the limited storage of the surface pro and it simply works! at the price point of below 60$ I think its a steal!,
"I am continually amazed by the fact that this tiny bit of almost nothing can be so powerful.  However, I caution anyone buying these Micro Cards for their GoPro that they are extremely easy to lose, but I highly recommend them.",
Was very concerned when I realized this sd card was NOT the correct one for go pro.  But all seems ok at this time.,
"I'm a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to compare the latest Kindle to. I don't own a Nook. I don't own an iPad (and, in any case, that's comparing apples to oranges). I don't have a Sony e-reader. 'This will be a short, simple review.I received my Kindle about a week ago and haven't been able to put it down.Things I like about my Kindle1. The e-ink display is amazing.2. Using the 5-way controller is simple and effective.3. Page turn speeds are faster than I thought they would be.4. It's lightweight, even with the attached cover (I have an Amazon cover with a built-in light)5. Page-turning buttons are quiet and well-placed.6. Recharge time is fast.7. I can order a book and start reading it in less than 60 seconds. Nice!8. Portability... I can take 3,000 books with me when I travel for work and not require additional suitcases or baggage fees.Things I'm not too keen on1. Buttons are too close together and are laid out oddly.2. Lack of individual number buttons is frustrating.3. Power button on the bottom Not a bad thing. Just an odd thing. (Same for the headphone input). I usually rest the bottom of a book on my lap when I read.Things I hope change in the future1. How books are organized... When I put a book in a collection (which is actually a tag), it still appears in the main list. It's not actually moved, it's merely associated.2. The look of the main screen. I'd like folders or some other way to display collections.3. Ability to create personal screen savers.4. E-book pricing, though Amazon has little control over this. Still, most titles are the same price as or less than their hardback/paperback counterparts.Read more",

"I put it in my new Roku 2 XS and it seemed to work - that is, it recognized and formatted it. I'm hoping to use my Roku for music and video. I suppose that mostly I'll be streaming but I thought I'd give myself the option of locally storing some of the media.",
There is a reason why this memory card has thousands of 5 star ratings. Good price and it works well.,
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
SanDisk is well know brand. The MSD Ultra 64 GB class 10 is the good one to buy.It transfers file faster than other brand card. I bought two of them when they are on sell.The price is very reasonable. I like it very much.,
Yep. Works like it should.,
I bought this card for my Samsung Galaxy S3.  Unfortunately it failed after 4 months.  I contacted SanDisk and they promptly sent me another.  It has been going strong for 6 months.,
"It works but the actual R/W speeds are 18/8 MB/s, not even Class 10. It should be marketed as ""Sandisk Basic"", not Sandisk Ultra"", unless they mean ultra slow. Now is 2014 and there is no excuse for such slow card from Sandisk.*** UPDATE ***I have redone the test with NotePro 12.2"" instead of using non UHS-I PC and the latest results are 32/8.6MB/s. Since the read speed hits 30, I believe the device is DHS-I ready. Still underwhelmed by the write speed though.",
"I recently upgraded from a nearly three-year-old HTC Windows Phone to a Samsung Galaxy S4 and decided to give it a huge memory boost. This card filled the bill perfectly. Add a good file manager to your App collection so you can use it effectively. Recommended.As an aside, I would have upgraded to another Windows Phone if WP8 permitted number blocking for nuisance callers. But it doesn't, so they lost me to Android.",
"Bought this along with my GoPro Hero 3 and it's been in that ever since. It's nice to have a ridiculous amount of storage while running around with a GoPro because who wants to have to change chips when you're out on a jetski... or falling out of a plane from 15,000 feet?",
"I bought this for my wife when it was on sale for Black Friday 2013, and has been coming to good use since. She appreciates the fact that she has extra (other than built in storage) for her phone to be able to hog on to more pics, music, and games. Great deal on a great product.",
"If you like the Kindle Fire HD then you will love the Kindle Fire HDX. The new device runs three times faster, is lighter in weight, and the battery lasts slightly longer. The sound quality on this device is excellent and the display quality is absolutely stunning. Below are some of the features to expect from the Fire HDX. BUILD QUALITY---There is NO blue haze on the 8.9 HDX.---The build quality is excellent.---Auto contrast is good (not buggy).---Operating system is very intuitive except after downloading free prime videos to watch offline. If you remove the videos from your Carousel then, from the video menu, you must go to the left side bar, and click *downloads* to see your videos. PRIME DOWNLOAD ISSUES (free video download limitations)Prime members can download selected Prime Instant Videos to watch when not connected to the internet. There are major restrictions imposed on prime videos as listed below.---Not all Prime titles are available for download.---Most popular prime titles are NOT available for download.---There is a max of 25 titles that can be downloaded free at any one time.---Prime titles have a viewing period.---Viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the video, or 15-30 days (which ever comes first).---After the viewing period expires you need to reconnect to the internet.---Titles can be downloaded to only two separate devices at a time.---If you exceed the device quota then you must delete one of the titles before adding to another device.---There is no way to know which titles can be downloaded unless you have the HDX (amazon does not place a banner on the titles other than to say PRIME).Read more",
Fast and Reliable micro SD. Very happy with this. And a huge storage capacity for a price that makes me happy.,
"This was a complete waste of 24. I read reviews and thought the product was better than a thin piece of sticky plastic. Lasted about one week. And my husband is not a frequent user of his cellphone, either. So for someone who carries cell with them and uses daily will probably last a day or so.",
"Just put this memory card into my S3, formatted it from the storage menu on the S3, then downloaded the Sandisk Memory Zone app from the Google Playstore on my phone.  If I have issues with this memory card I'll come back here to update this review but so far so good!",
Previously purchased two ADATA microsd cards one which never worked and one which failed on the second boot.So far no problems with tht sansdisk chip.,
"This is a great controller for our Fire TV, I purchased 2 of them, with two problems but let me first talk about the good. The controller works well for most of the games we play on the Fire TV. It has a long range compared to other controllers Ive tried (solid at 30 feet) and uses WiFi Direct instead of Bluetooth. The feel of it is decent (not too rubbery) and none of the buttons, D-Pad, or sticks have stuck or given us a problem. The microphone on it works as good or better than the one on the Fire TV remote.Now on to the problems. Its such an issue that Im not just putting it in the cons section but am going to tell you a bit about it. The worst problem is the battery life! In fact, its such a huge problem that Im taking off 2 stars because of it. This controller eats batteries like nobodys business. I have tried regular AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), expensive AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), and rechargeable AA batteries (Ive tried Energizer, Apple, AmazonBasics). The controller doesnt drain the batteries completely, nope. That I would understand. Instead, the controller stops working after only a 40 drain. I kid you not. Every set of batteries I have put into this thing has stopped working when there is still 60 battery life left. I have tested each set, before and after, using a generic battery tester as well as an ohm meter.The second problem may not be the controller itself, it may be the Fire TV, but its affecting the controller. The controller randomly disconnects. Not often enough for it to be a huge issue but just enough for it to be annoying. I have seen reports of others having the same problem with the controller and the remote. Im hoping that this issue will be fixed with a firmware update.Read more",
"As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing my first impressions of the Fire HD 8 from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the Paperwhite (2013,2014,2015 models), the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9 (3rd and 4th generation). Here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new Fire HD8.Amazon removed the Fire HD7, the Fire HDX7 and the Fire HDX8.9 and replaced them with the Fire HD (7 screen), Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10.HARDWARE:WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: The HD8 Fire, a short USB cord and a power adapter. Finally, Amazon ships a power adapter with their Fires so you can charge and use the device right out of the box. (Picture attached)SIZE: The HD8 is longer than the older HD7 but the same width as the discontinued HD7. It is also thinner. (8.4x5.0x0.3 versus 7.5x5.0x0.4). I have large hands and can hold it with one hand, but even with my hands, I really need to use both hands. Because it is longer, it seem top heavy to me. The back is also slick and slippery to hold. Mine has a habit of sliding off the table.Display: The resolution of the screen is 1280 x 800 same as the HD 7 but the pixel density is lower due to the longer screen length. In practical use, though, you can't tell the difference. The display is nice and bright but barely readable in bright sunlight. One nice touch is that now, you can choose your own wallpaper! It comes with 9 stock images and if you don't like one of them, you can choose your own image in your Amazon Photos folder.Read more",

"I trusted this company but they only warranty their products about two months. I used the micro SD card in a Go Pro camera for approximately one (filming) hour and the third time I inserted it into the camera it showed;NO SD CARD;. After further investigation the card was determined to be bad. Amazon will not stand behind the card and I am out $50. This is a rare situation with Amazon, they are usually very helpful when a product is no good so this very well could be the SanDisc company behind the short warranty. When you pay this much money and the product doesn't even last two months, it should get NO stars, but then you know I cannot do that!UPDATE~ AMAZON DID REPLACE THIS CARD AFTER I SENT IT BACK TO THEM SO I UPGRADED THIS REVIEW TO THREE STARS",
Speed squeaks in at a bare minimum of a class 10. Good for tablets and smartphones wouldn't recommend it for Picture or Video Camera's,

"The Fire HD 8 kids tablet is essentially an HD 8 with the kids cover, FreeTime, and a 2 year warranty. Lots of improvements over the previous kids edition tablet such as dual band wifi, higher quality 720p screen, Dolby stereo speakers, double the storage, and increased battery life.The kids cover allows your little one to get a good grip on it and also provides exceptional protection from drops. The IPS screen has excellent viewing angles, vibrant colors, and offers plenty of brightness indoors. However once you move outside the screen will wash out if you're in the sun. The dual speakers give you true stereo sound and offer plenty of volume. It's a shame that the cameras don't offer higher resolution, but none the less the rear cam does take a decent picture even if your hands aren't that steady. Should you fill up the internal storage you can add up to a 256GB microSD card.FreeTime has a wealth of content, and it includes a kid-safe web browser that will only load sites that are whitelisted by you or Amazon. If you don't want your child using the browser then it can be turned off. You can also restrict access to certain categories, set time limits, and view what your children are watching and reading with the Parent Dashboard. After the first year there is a nominal fee to continue using the service.Tips:- You can view Amazon videos offline when not connected to wifi. Switch to your adult profile and download the video(s). Now go into settings, profiles and family library, select your child profile, add content, videos, and select your videos.- You can sideload Google Play and gain access to even more apps such as YouTube Kids.- You can set FreeTime to only allow entertainment content after daily educational goals have been met.",
I bought this for my GoPro and so far it's worked without problems (the gopro runs out of batteries before I can fill this up).,
"does what it should ... 64 gigs in such a tiny physical space is crazy ... makes my phone's capacity huge.  if you use it in an mp3 player, you will have to convert it to fat 32, but it isn't hard; there are plenty of free programs out there you can download.  so this WILL work in those devices as well ... sweet.",
"I bought this to expand the memory on my Galaxy S4. Inexpensive, easily to install, and comes with an adapter to make it a full sized SD card, the SanDisk Ultra should be at the top of your list.",
"I've had nothing but success with SanDisk MicroSD Cards. Although you may pay a few bucks more than the generic brand, you don't want to trust your pictures or video recording to anything else.As such I only buy Sandisk MicroSD Cards.. Keep up the good quality!",
"I have had this for 8 months, and the SD Card already stopped deleting files and keeping pictures.  I have tried reformatting, and nothing helps.  Not cool.Update - April 2, 2014 - I contacted Sandisk and I am sending the problematic card back for warranty replacement.  I hope this will resolve the issue with the card.  I will keep you updated once the process is complete.",
Is exactly what you can expect from a memory card. Nothing more nothing less. I tested the card in my GopRo Hero3 and it worked.,
"I'm listening to music stored thereon, I read books, plays, etc. from the Gutenberg Project that are stored there.  I download podcasts from ITunes and transfer it to my tablet.  It is wonderful.  I always expect great things from SanDisk.  Would replace it if it stopped working.",
I wanted a micro SD card for a camera I purchased and this fit the bill at a reasonable price.Fit right in and works well,
"I bought it to expand my Surface RT tablet, reliable and stable my data is intact and secure.Highly recommended",
Great for my LG Optimus G and super fast transfer speeds. And no lagging for the games the many 3D games on my android.,
Can't go wrong with Sandisk! Always works. Never any issues. And this one is no different. More than enough storage space,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
when i got it it was broken so i had to send it back... they sent me a new one immediately. i am so happy  cause my phone's internal capacity is 2 gigs... that's not much... -_-,
"Purchased this item for a LePan TC970 tablet. All I can say is, &#34;Works great!&#34;Okay, and so I have to type 5 more words on this review so that I can post it.",
"the voice recognition makes finding content so easy, even worked with hulu+I already had a mogo pro so I tried out the games and for a android console they are first ratefar better then oyua which i'm sorry to say i'll never use again.the tv and music content and menu's are very quick thanks to the very powerful hardware under the hoodoverall I'm positive that this unit will kill roku and apple tveven google chromecast better be careful (I own all these units so I speak from experience)",
Works great (more than I can say for the GoPro).  I do pull it out an put it into my computer using that little SD adapter.  Way quicker to pull 16 GB that way (I don't know why).,
I bought this for use in my Blackberry Z10. It works great for me as I hold all of my music from iTunes and my most precious pictures of my wife and kids.No problems whatsoever with my Z10,
Got this for my Galaxy S4 and this thing has lived up to expectations for speed and performance.  Writes fast while taking 1080P Movies and the Burst Shot function creates many HD Pictures.,
A must have for those who listen to a lot of music on the go...wish they made a 128gb model.,
"This thing definitely improved performance over the standard card. Transferring music, videos and pictures seem so much more seemless than they were before. Prior to this card, I had a 16GB standard microSD card that just felt like forever transferring data back and fourth from my phone. I recommend this to anyone who uploads a lot of music and videos onto their mobile devices! Transfer rates make up for the slightly higher cost!",
"I bought a Gopro and couldn't record anything because I didn't have a MicroSDHC Class 10 memory card.Now I do - Problem solved.Therefore, 5 stars!",
"I've gotten four of these for both of my Nikon D7000's and have had little bit of an issue with the adapter cards being out of spec and sticking in the Nikon Camera SD Slots, and one of my card readers. Sure enough, i sanded one down carefully and it fit perfectly.Performance wise, these things scream over regular Class 10 or Class 6 cards and perform nearly excellent. I cant complain other than I wish they were faster, but I'm not getting that for a while at $23 per card.",
I bought this as a Christmas gift. I'm told that they are enjoying it and are very Happy with all it can do.,
These are great little cards and are very fast. The only thing I hate about microSD is that they are so dang small and the slots are spring loaded. I have lost a couple from them shooting across the room.,
"My cell phone claims up to 16GB with a removable SDHC memory card, but when I bought this, it was a big gamble. I honestly didn't think it would work, being 4 times the rated capability, but it did and does. I have used it in 2 different phones, HTC and LG cell phones as well as my PC. Since it works very well in my cell phones, I expect it will work just as well in a tablet. Very happy with this purchase.",
"Good product, it arrived extremely fast and performs just as described. It was considerably cheaper than any other store I found. I specially like the speed of this SD Card. However do keep in mind that the speeds tend to be exaggerated. The speeds are way faster than normal SD CARD speeds and you will notice it, but not anywhere close to whats advertised. There a lot of factor that go in to consideration when it comes to the advertised speed. This is not the manufacture or seller fault, but it depends on the system that is being used.",
"Great memory card.  Using this along with out Roku3.  Works great.  Fast transfer rate, good capacity, and reasonable price.  What else could you ask for?",
"Happily nestled in the memory slot of my Nook Tablet and performing as promised.  Now, if only the Nook memory slot were easier to access....  All well.  The card arrived on time, well packaged, and has been chugging right along for two months now.  I would definately recommend it to any lover of video, music, or other space consuming files.",
"I originally bought an off-brand card for my new GS4 because the price seemed so good. Then, the day after I took a lot of pictures...they all mysteriously vanished :'(So, since I've had only good experiences with SanDisk in the past, I immediately found this card (which I was happy was on sale at the time) and bought it. I've had absolutely no problems and I expect it to continue working for a long time *knock on wood*BOTTOM LINEThis is a quality product. DON'T buy cards without a respectable brand name.",
So glad I purchased this productive it use it all the time,
Wanted more space on my smartphone.  Works great. What else can I say. Thinking of buying another as a back-up for my stuff.,
"What more can I say? The 64GB micro SD works for the Samsung Galaxy Note II! I simply popped in the card and there it was with no formatting. ""59GB of space"" couldn't be more happier.",
Bought a cheap tablet with no storage. This works fine and is fast. Now I have plenty of external android app storage and also videos to watch.,
I was amazed at the speed of this sd card on my smart phone the HD video no longer jumps and buffers while recording and the transfer time from pc to phone has decreased dramatically,
I just bought a 1080 P dash cam and I needed the best and fastest memory to get the best quality pictures. I did my homework and as I thought ScanDisk Ultra came out far above everything else out there.If you want the best and fastest memory with the highest quality on the market then get ScanDisk Ultra !,
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
"I love everything about this case except for how it fits on the Echo Dot. I was expecting a snug fit however, it is very lose and so you have to make sure that if you pick it up to move it (and the power cable is disconnected), the dot will fall out of the case.",
"I use this (with a Nifty MiniDrive, [...] to extend the built in SSD in my MacBook Pro. I highly recommend it for anyone needing a speedy flash card.",
It is a very handy device and I highly recommend it. I also enjoy using Alexa on it.,
"got the easy to open package the card worked first time, the Samsung pad recognized it, these cards are a bit expensive though.",
"Bought it when the price was low. Excellent value. Good transfer speeds and worked on my phone, camera and other devices as well.",
"I purchased this for my husband, he's had this quite a while now and love it SanDisk is a reputable product.",
"I have a long term positive experience using SanDisk cards. I have been very pleased with the way these cards work in my Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0. No problems whatsoever and the capacity is huge.I quickly became confused about the differences between the so called &#34;Mobile&#34; Ultra cards and the Ultra cards. The performance specs to my &#34;intermediate tech experience&#34; eyes were virtually the same. The prices were also similar, with the &#34;Mobile&#34;version slightly higher. To finally resolve my confusion I contacted SanDisk technical support. To my surprise, the &#34;Mobile&#34; version is the older, no longer manufactured version. The Ultra is the current model. So I immediately bought the current Ultra version, which very fortunately AMAZON had on sale!",
"Be sure you've updated your drivers.  One of my laptops said this was only 32GB, but I updated the drivers for my card reader and it -then- showed up as 64GB SDXC.Works in Acer Iconia A700 -after- formatting as FAT32.  You can't do that natively in Windows, but there are tools out there that work.Great item, great price, and arrived three days BEFORE anything else I ordered on the same day.  Great seller.",
"this is probably the Nth memory card I've bought from sandisk, and so far I'm still very happy. r/w speeds are decent and none have given me any troubles.",
"128GB in the size of a fingernail for this price, who'da thunk it?Works fine in my Sansa Clip Zip (using Rockbox software - probably fine with original firmware but I haven't tried it).NOTA BENE: As with all SDHC/XC cards, it comes from the factory formatted to ExFAT.For Rockbox at least, and probably other software, reformatting to FAT32 is required.If your device or software supports ExFAT, you won't care about this caveat.I'm only using it for MP3 bitrates, so I can't comment on speed issues.The dark red printing on the card is hard to read compared to the white on the 64GB cards.AWESOME!  Thank you Sandisk and Amazon.",
It's nice and portable and works well on the go. Wished it had the option to be able to use voice commands without pushing the button.,
"Perfect.  Took card put old 32gb card and transferred it over to it in the computer.  (while my Samsung galaxy s5 was off).  Then inserted it in my Samsung galaxy s5, powered up and it was like I had never took the 32gb card out.  Read ringtones, programs stored on external sd card, everything - no errors, no glitches.  Connected the phone to the computer via usb cable and (usb 3 slot) and in no time my 75gb of music was transferred to my phone and it all read and is working perfectly.  I could not be more pleased when a products works like it is supposed to.",
I use this in my Samsung Galaxy Work Pro 12.2 Tablet. It woks so what else can you say?,
Bought this to add to my daughter's new ASUS Transformer. Excellent access and storage speed.,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears.

Bought it for Father's Day and my dad and mom love it!,
SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A fits very nicely in the HTC Vivid and the system recognized it right off the bat! Simple and easy to format the disk and then encrypting it was a snap as well. There are many reviews on the internet about this product possibly NOT working in the HTC Vivid....I am a believer in doing the research and reading the reviews. It works like a champ and the price was reasonable on Amazon!,
Haven't been able to train Alexa like we've heard. Probably our own fault. We have fun with it.,
Lighting fast card and very well priced. came with backup software that allows your phone to be backed up to either a cloud service or to the sd card.,
Be careful with buying micro cards out there.! There's a ton of phonies out there but this one is the real deal and you just can't go wrong with the sandisk brand name and it was for a very reasonable price too.!,
"I've had this card for over a year, and it has worked great as a backup storage source for our digital camcorder (1080p/60).  It seems to keep up just fine, and functions perfectly.The only (albeit minor) nit is that the microSDHC to SDHC adapter seems to not work in all card readers.  I'm not sure why, but it wasn't worth removing a star for that.",
what can I say it's a memory card okay it is fast and compatible good quality perfect perfect perfect perfect,
"Always loved the Amazon Echo. Now we can rake it with us, outside, wherever!",
"If you use one of the  larger MP  taking camera ( 12-14-16 etc)  you need this card.  Taking photos on those kinds of cameras really chews up the smaller MP cards.  Don't go on vacation without at least 1 of these babies, or you'll be having to carry lots of cards and probably end up losing one and your memories.",
I loaded this card up with home movies for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. The copy process from computer to card was fast. There are no skips in the movie quality and I have plenty of room left to go. Wish I had bought another for more collections.,
Used it in my Galaxy Note 2 for the past 16 months. All the sudden it is no longer writable. I tried many ways to reformat the card. Even Windows says format successful but all files remain after I remove and re-insert the card. Since I have private files in the card I'm not able to delete. I do not want to sent it back to SanDisk for replacement.,
"I had been using a 'regular' SanDisk 32GB Micro SD card that came included with my HTC Thunderbolt I bought in 2011. The size was decent, but I never realized until upgrading how much I was lacking on the speed.I finally got one of these to replace my old card with my Galaxy S3. It is superb. I just recently got a Galaxy S4, and again, this card is just about the best expansion you can add to most any phone.With my old MicroSD card, I had gotten used to just sitting there, zoning out, as I waited patiently for my computer to transfer pictures/videos off my card to be backed-up to my PC's hard drive, or copying some music files from my PC to my card. With this new card, almost any single file (even hundreds of megabytes big) is an instant transfer, that transfers too quick to even bring up that &#34;moving&#34; dialog box in Windows 8. On my very big transfers (lots of HD video files at once, totaling several gigabytes), I have to wait, but I'm waiting for seconds instead of minutes.Combine the excellent speed with the fact that 64GB can hold a ton of data (compared to typical storage sizes on phones), and you have a very satisfied customer. Now I can procrastinate even longer the occasional transfers of all my pictures and videos to my PC, though I try not to.A lot of phones (like my S4) specify 64GB SDXC cards as the maximum they support, so this is about the best you can even get for the moment, unless you want to pay almost double for SanDisk's Extreme cards. Unless you have money to burn, I think these are a much better value and diminishing returns certainly kick in beyond this price point. But perhaps my next phone will support 4K HD video onto 256GB cards and I will yet again need to upgrade my card's capacity and speed... Anyway, bottom line on this product: AWESOME.",
Comes with a nice little adapter for your MicroSDHC so you can use it as a normal size SD card also. pretty neat.Considering for the price at 24$ for 32gb is pretty reasonable class 10 is fast for any HD 1080p video recording or DSLR camera.I bought this for myself to use with the GoPro 3. Taking picture & Videos working great as it didn't give anycorrupted files videos & pictures yet. Its working pretty good. San-disk is a pretty reliable brand as you won't be able to go wrong with it.,
"I bought 2 of those SanDisk 32 GB microSD , used them on my Galaxy Note and Galaxy S4First one , my phone started saying it was removed , then recognize it again :) then diedI thought it's just a luck , plugged in the 2nd one :) stayed for about 2 months and died suddenly ! and lost everythingnever buying from SanDisk again .. ever",
"Got this for my Galaxy S3 after getting it's bigger brother for my new camera. needed the extra space for all my media(music, photos, video) and as usual, Sandisk delivers. Very very satisfied.",
"After having the FireTV for about a month now, I can confidently recommend this product for most people. Versus the current generation Apple TV, ChromeCast and Roku offerings, the FireTV is the best value due to it's access to a wide variety of content, build quality and advanced features. It's a device I have recommended to my (almost-elderly) parents my (geeky) friends.Best things about the FireTV: - It is fast - unlike the Roku it does not lag and feels like a high quality product - Has Amazon Prime Video access- if you have prime membership, this is the best accessory you can buy. Lots of great content from Comedy Central and newer movies versus Netflix. - An AppStore with apps games you actually want - Plex Showtime AnyTime are the big difference makers IMO. - If you have local video files on your network, Plex is the way to go. - Voice searchWorst things about the FireTV (which really aren't that bad): - Annoying/long intro video upon the first time you boot up - Larger power adapter versus Apple TV (Yes the little things count) - No HBOGO until late 2014 - Going to be a problem from the folks looking for their Game of Thrones fix this spring** - No chromecast/airplay like feature unless you have an amazon tablet**If you don't need HBOGO right now and don't have a bunch of apple products, stop reading this right now and buy this device. You won't regret it.** See below for ways around thisIf you are an advanced user and/or are on the fence this next section is for you.Before the FireTV, I had 3 Apple Tv 2's in my house that I used to access HBOGO, Hulu+, Netflix my local media through the infuse application. I had tried Roku's, ChromeCast and other media boxes/home theater pc's and the Apple TV worked best for me. While this has served me well there are obvious drawbacks - lack of 1080p video, limited app selection, no games, etc.... Which led me to trying the FireTV.Because the FireTV is based on android, android apps can be side loaded on the device and many work fine. The steps below will outline how to get started side loading apps to your FireTV. You may want to have a usb keyboard and mouse handy - you'll need them to get a few things running. Any old usb keyboard/mouse you have lying around should work OK.(The following links provide the best directions I have come across during my time with the device and have worked for me and should work for you too, but no promises)How to sideload applications to the FireTV:1. The first step in loading android apps is getting ADB set up on your machine can be done by following amazon's directions - developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/connecting-adb2. After that, you can go ahead and proceed with side loading applications, also by following amazon's directions - developer.amazon.com/sdk/asb/app-install.html3. If you aren't comfortable with working with the command line, and are running windows, you can try this great GUI application to automatically side load applications. - forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.phpt2736740Once you are able to send android apps (.apk) files to the FireTV, I recommend:1. Installing MXPlayer to allow .MKV .AVI video file playback: sites.google.com/site/mxvpen/download2. If your network drive/computer doesn't support plex, try using ESFileExplorer to navigate to play back video files - appsapk.com/es-file-explorer/3. AirReceiver which mimics the functionality of airplay on an appletv. Please note this only supports unencrypted video feeds. This is a paid app, buy play.google.com/store/apps/detailsidcom.softmedia.receiver4. HBOGO android app can be installed and works rather well. It does require a mouse to navigate.5. XBMC - If you know what this, you will want it and yes it works. Download via xbmc.orgFor the cord cutters out there, I've tried installing Aereo Slingbox with mixed results. Slingbox for tablets loads and opens ok. Using the mouse I was able to accept the terms conditions and input my user info. Unfortunately it doesn't load the video stream. Other folks have had success apparently, so it may be just me. Aereo side loads opens fine but I couldn't sign up for a trial as I am 1 town over from being in their current market area. I will update this review if I get any further with either.There are many more apps you may want to try so check out this comprehensive list of app functionality from the reddit.com/r/firetv folks - docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uD6cesLVtHwsoWDE9jlKsV9FtlUbQ3KvDQp6N9gbHE/editgid1337307432This list includes information on emulators roms which I didn't include in this review due to their dubious legality.",
Have this for a action cam - works great so far.  Can't wait for my zip line tour.  Was not expensive as you would think for this size of memory card.,
"This died so fast and I barely used it.  in fact, I did not even put anything on it and it died.  My pad recognized it for a few weeks, but when I went to put stuff on it, it was dead.Complete garbage, stay away.",
"I bought this card when I got my Note 2 back in October, it is perfect and fast.  No problems in any way and fully compatible with my device.UPDATE 1/15/14: I bought a second card for my Note 3 and it it excellent.  The frustration free packaging was much appreciated from the other packing last year.  My first original card got corrupted when I put it in an old feature phone but I am confident it had nothing to do with the card in any way.  I have tested these cards with the Galaxy Note 2, Note 3, Note 10.1 2014 and Tab 3 7"" and they all read the card no problem.  I have been extremely satisfied so far.",
"great product.  I use san disk ultra 64 GB on all of my tablets,  I would highly recommend these to all of my friends",
"The Amazon Echo Show is a voice-activated device. You can instruct it to play video content, play music, stream online audio, order products and services, and control home automation products. The Echo Show is the first device of its kind to feature its own screen, which in my opinion, greatly enhances the use and potential of this device.Ive been using this device for a few days so far. Below you will find some of my initial impressions: What I Like Good build quality: The Show has a nice, bright screen that has good viewing angles.Good sound: The speakers on the Show sound much better than the original echo.Easy setup: Setup was extremely easy, mostly due to the Shows touch screen. After making a few selections, the Show was up and running in no time.Content suggestions: When you aren't interacting with the Show, it continuously displays content suggestions. I like that it will suggest videos to watch.Video content: I like being able to view Amazon Video, video news briefings, movie trailers, and YouTube videos on the Show.Video calling: Video calling works as advertised. I like being able to initiate a call with my voice.Music with lyrics: When playing songs from Amazon Music, you can see album art and song lyrics on the screen.Home automation: Like other Echos, the Show can control your smart home products. The show has the extra ability to display camera feeds.On-screen apps: The echo can display my calendar, reminders, lists, timers, local weather, and more. Because of this, I find the Show infinitely more useful than the original Echo. What I Don't Like The Show needs more functionality that leverages the touch screen.Read more",
"I bought the SanDisk 32 Gb micro SD card (class 10) in Dec for a new Galaxy S3. I used it for songs and video and pics. It started acting flaky in April and would unmount itself and then remount and I had problems with playing music. Then it completely died and would not even reformat. This is a known issue, and I will write back after I try to get SanDisk to replace it.",
"Losing pictures, video, and tunes after 9 months on a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (stock android).  Looks like this is a common problem.  I will try my luck with Sandisk on Monday.  If I don't get a replacement, I will never buy a Sandisk product again.  I paid the premium for ""Sandisk Quality.""  I am very disappointed.UPDATE:Sandisk will be providing a replacement SD CARD.  However, my data loss and downtime cannot be replaced.  SanDisk lost their ""premium rating"" in my eyes. It's going to take a while for them to get it back.",
"From what I've seen, this memory seems to have the best stats for transfer speeds and whatnot, but I'll let you do that research on your own, as far as the rest is concerned.Pros:The packaging was plenty to protect the product.Came with the adapter to the full size SD card (most of them do, but this is definitely nice)The price beat those that I could find locally.Cons:none really that I can think of.",
Works great with my smart phone. Didn't need to format the card or anything. Just popped the card in and everything worked great out of the box. Transfer speeds are excellent with this card. I would recommend this card to everyone.,
What can you say about SanDisk?  They always work and perform the way they are met to do.  Got this for my Samsung Tab 10.1 and it works flawlessly.,
"I can't believe how fast this is.  i had a class 10, 32GB card by imation and it was nothing like the speeds I get out of this.",
"I just bought two of these for our two new Samsung Galaxy IV smart phones.  The adapters will make it possible for the card readers on our computers to accept these MicroSD cards if we find it worthwhile to pull them out of the phone case rather than use the USB &#34;dongle&#34; to move information on and off the phones, but.. most importantly, now I don't worry about storing audio books, favorite playlists, and video clips I might want to show someone on the phones.",
Arrived very quickly. No issues whatsoever. Lots of storage space for music and pictures when used with a phone that is compatible.,
The SD slot on my laptop recognized this card immediately.  When I put it in my Droid Razr Maxx it recognized the proper amount but the phone required a reformat.Since install my phone has had some instability but I haven't had enough time to troubleshoot to determine whether or not it is due to the card.  Motorola says the phone can handle 32gig cards.  Some users have reported the 64gig works fine. Other users have reported problems with the 64gig card. Other than the phone instability the storage on the card seems to be working fine for now.,
I use this in a D-Link web cam and it is fast read/write and reliable SanDisk are the best! I have tried other brands but always fall back on SanDIsk!,
"This is an excellent storage in the minimal space. It come with the adapter, so I am able to read in the regular SD card reader also.",
"Purchased in November 2012 (less than 18 months ago)  for use in my then new Samsung Galaxy S3.  It has never been removed from the phone until today when it failed.  Since the phone is still fine and the memory card is stored well inside, it's safe to assume this card has suffered no abuse.  Today, the card is totally unreadable.  It can't be formatted by the phone.  The PC doesn't see it at all.  It's dead, Jim.  I'll be contacting SANDISK about warranty today.UPDATE:  I've updated this from 1 start to 4 because although it failed, SANDISK is replacing it at no charge.  Sometimes stuff fails. If a manufacturer will stand by it, that speaks well.  Nice that because I bought it on Amazon I could search my orders and find the original invoice to use when I contacted them.",
"Could not be happier.  It's fast, works great, and I didn't have to risk an appendage trying to get it out of retail packaging.  I've been a fan of SanDisk for years, and this is why - solid product.",
Good and fast enough for a car camcorder to write a Full HD video. Used with HP F200 car camcorder.,
I did not do any bench tests to see to verify the read and white but been very happy with it.,
It was a gift. It was a gift. It was a gift. It was a gift.,
Good SD card and works fine with adapter.  Satisfied with purchase of this product.  Can fill it quickly though with HD video.,
"I actually was pretty happy with my kindle initially. It had some good apps, the screen had really good quality and I like their support features. That's where the good news ends.As I started using my kindle more an more, I noticed that some of the apps which are free on my android tablet or iPad, I had to pay for on my kindle. Initially I was surprised but I decided it was a minor nuisance.What really put me over the edge is that about 6 months after I purchased my Kindle I noticed that my screen was cracked as I was pulling it out of my backpack. Now I really take care of my things so I was surprised that it broke. Nothing against the quality of the product, but it was definitely surprising because it is fairly well protected with a padded sleeve in my backpack. Anyhow, I called into Amazon support to see what I could do about it but they told me that I would have to buy a new one. The support person I spoke to on the phone said that she would try to speak to her supervisor to see if they would be willing to replace it for me but later came back and said that they cannot replace it and that they would have to sell me a new one at a 'reduced rate'.At this point, I'm thinking Im going to skip out on the reduced price Kindle for 150, that they offered me and I'm going back to my iPad. Why Well for one, I won't have to pay the additional money for otherwise free apps. Two, I know that I will have my iPad covered under warranty no matter what happens.So the key thing to keep in mind before you buy a Kindle is the following:1 - There are no official repair facilities. So if you break your screen, you are forced to buy a new one. If you go with something more common like an iPad or a Android tablet, you can find repair facilities all around. And with Apple, you can get the extended care and they WILL replace your iPad screen (or even your whole iPad) if/when you break it.2 - Apps are more expensive because you cannot buy them from Google Play. You have to buy higher priced versions of the exact same app from Amazon. Later, if you decide that the Kindle isn't for you, you have just wasted all that money on apps that will stay with a useless Kindle.The apps thing is bearable but the lack of repair facilities or help is not. I think I would be have given the kindle 4 start if they offered and extended protection plan so that we knew that we were going to keep our purchase for a longer period of time. I mean let's face it, the probability of anyone damaging their kindle within the life expectancy of the product is fairly high. So your investment is this product will last as long as you can maintain it in good shape.At this point, I'm cutting my losses and moving back to the iPad.",
I should have known better. Everyone is complaining about this memory card if you read reviews on specialized forums. Last time I buy anything from Sandisk.,
"My wife's Verizon Motorola Droid 4 immediately recognized this memory card, mounted and formatted it.  She'll can now store vast amounts of music and photos on her smart phone before she ever runs out of memory with this micro SD card.",
"A name you can trust.  Good price, now I just have to figure out how to use it in my Note.",
This item was priced right and fit right into my cell phone without any issues. Does what it is suppose to do and I don't know what else I could say. Being a class 10 it is suppose to be plenty fast for cell phone use which I am sure speeds up camera use to some degree. Has worked well and the shipping was fast.,
"Works good with Nokia Lumia 822. Has plenty of space for music, pictures and especially for movies at high resolution.",
"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more",
"When i first got this item, I had some problems with it and for some reason, caused all my data on my android phone to get deleted forcing me to reinstall my custom ROM and use my previous SD card until amazon replaced this one. But once I got the replacement, it worked perfectly. I have no issues with it at all now and for the past several months, its able to hold all my apps and data with ease. With the high read/write speeds, I don't have any lag and it just works exactly how I hoped it would.",
"My new Android phone (T-Mobile upgrade) has a Micro SD slot, but did not come with any card installed. When I read that it could take up to 32 GB, I searched for the best deal and this was it! Super fast, great price, couldn't be happier! :-)",
"This thing works great. I have it to store pictures and videos and it works perfectly. I put it in and it formatted, and after that, no hassle at all. It was the best priced microsd here on Amazon and I am happy with the purchase. I would buy again if I needed to.",
"So, essentially you have about 28 - 29 GB, but it seems to be quite a bit for me. I have yet to use even a quarter of that, and I take pictures every week. I had a problem with how it transferred some videos to my computer once, but that my be because I forgot to format it and prepare my tablet for removal of the SC card.It is definitely surprising how small it is! Be careful not to lose it!",
No issues at all... wish it were water proof. My kids and family love it.,
"Bought this card for my Xperia V. You would have to format it on the phone before it works as exfat file system is not recognized by the phone. Phone will format it to FAT32 so you would have a limit of 4gb for each file. Once formatted to fat32..my laptop (Sony Vaio S13) didn't recognized the card anymore using the adapter, but using an external card reader/writer (using a Sandisk Imagemate All-in-One USB3.0 reader writer) the card can be read and reformatted again. Also, when connecting the phone via the USB cable to the laptop, the laptop recognizes the fat32 formatted card. Lots of storage now for my phone for all those music and videos :D",
The Amazon Tap is a great addition to my Smarthome system. We particularly like that we can move it from room to room without AC attached & the battery lasts a long time. We even take it outside to listen to music from Amazon Prime and Spotify. We recommend it highly.,
"I got a card and it wouldn't let me copy files to it, it would (a) not recognize on any of the three computers or my android tab at home, and (b) unmount itself in the middle of file copies.  These two things happened randomly.  I got a replacement, but it suffered from the problem of letting me format it (yay, farther than I got with unit 1), then crapping out 300mb into a file transfer.AVOID THIS GUY.",
"I got this card for my sony action cam, and it is the best memory card, it work fast and process eveything fast, I recomend this",
"Bought this to add memory to a 16 gig Samsung Gallaxy 3.Easy to install, and was recognized right away by the phone without need to format.Note; the SD to micro-SD adapter that ships with it, is a little tight.When I mounted the memory card in the adapter, It was tight, and very hard to remove, the first 6-7 times.",
Purchased two of these in total. One to hold the music for my mp3 player and one to hold the music for my smart phone. Both work well. Easy to load. No problems encountered. They serve my intended purposes well. Arrived quickly and in good condition. Pleased with purchase.,
"I love it,other than the problem I have with my one game I called about. It is still happening with it.",
"Love this product. It is nice looking, easy to carry, and the sound is amazing. Very easy to set up and connect to amazon echo. Nothing to complain about th he speaker itself. However the carrying case is kind of stupid and useless also. One has to take it down just in order to charge.",
"works great with my GoPro camera, and had no problem using it in my computer, all the videos are recorded just fine and in good quality",
Card works great and I use it for our GoPro Hero 3 exclusively.  No issues at all while on a Yellowstone trip,
I think a really good memory card at good price. I got it and still have s lot of space for all my music and videos.,
"I bought this to expand the limited memory of my Dell Venue Pro. I use it to store MP4 videos and MP3 music and streaming/playing both work very well. Even the description explicitly says &#34;Reformat into file system other than exFAT may cause instability&#34; I'd hope to use it to remap my OneDrive (FKA SkyDrive) folder which requires it being reformatted to NTFS.  The warning is correct--between Windows 8.1, the tablet and the SanDisk MicroSDXC the OS became unstable.  Once I'd reformatted and changed OneDrive's location to it I rebooted Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.1 could not detect the card. I reformatted the card back to exFAT and it works as expected.",
"I have missed my Pandora since I moved from Ft. Worth, TX to Colorado a few months ago. My nephew had the Amazon Tap and I was amazed at all the things his kids were having fun with it ( saying.. ALEXA.. tell MIMI (their Grandmother) to GO TO BED.. AND IT DID!! And the sound and quality of music coming from it. Awesome. :) I had to have one, so I went to local Best Buy and bought it. I even set it up myself (I'm 65 so was impressed with myself! LOL) but I have listened nonstop to 60s music or music from DIRTY DANCING (which I loved). I have ordered a little case from Amazon.com to keep it if it tips over or just to carry from room to room, which I have been doing. I feel like I have a new found friend.... love listening to this little cylinder who is as good as BOSE in my book! Get it, you'll love it! I DO!! :) VERY VERY pleased with it! Weather updates here or where my kdis are. Just checking. :)No interruptions or commercials when listening ALL DAY LONG!",
We love that it is portable and can move from room to room effortlessly.,
I bought this micro SD card for my Galaxy Note 2 about 5 months ago and its been great. Plug and play with no problems. It recognized it immediate and right after I was able to transfer 20gb of videos/music to my phone right away. The transfer speed is good and is what I was expecting from reading guides on these type of SD cards. This is a good product and I recommend it to anyone looking for a SD card.,
"I have an old SanDisk SD card that still works. I thought their new cards would be just as reliable, but I was wrong.The microsd card failed yesterday inside my phone. I used the adapter to connect it to my computer, but it wouldn't mount.I bought this directly from Amazon and not a third party vendor, so I know it's genuine SanDisk.",
I bought this for my 6yr old's Nabi tablet. Thing works perfectly allowing him to download music and games with ease. Loved the price and trust SanDisk products.,
"I just received my Fire TV box today, and it is everything promised and then some, imho. I've been exploring it (and got started on Fargo) for the last 3 hours and the menus are intuitive, the voice search is quite nice, and I love the way the remote feels in my hand. A value buy, in my opinion, especially if you are an amazon instant video subscriber. I haven't even explored all the other sources.",
thanks a lot sandisk good job works with adapter on nikon d800 flawless. non stop 20 min hd 1080p recording,
"Good price good quality, This card works perfectly for my video recorder as well as my Canon 500D. The class 10 really bust up the speed when you need to import the photo or video.",
"The only company capable of making a reliable micro SD at 64 gigs. In all reality they are the only company capable of making a fully reliable SD card period, of any size and type. Despite the Galaxy phone issues, this card has excellent read spead, format speed, and decent write speed. I upgraded from my 32gig SanDisk (that I paid a mere 20 bucks for!) in my smart phone to this and had absolutely no issues.As a complete side note, I'm amazed at the capability to fit 64 gigs on a micro SD. I love it. My friend runs a tiny homemade built PC off of a 16 gig Sandisk as the harddrive and it works brilliantly.",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
Works well with my new Garin virb elite,
"64 GB on a micro-SD card ... that itself was amazing to me and Sandisk has perfected the technology.No complains whatsoever, works great in my S4 ... have been clicking photos and videos ever since i put this in.It comes with an adapter, so you can plug it into your computer and download content easilyIts fast, even if it is almost full - unlike other cards i have used where it starts to get slow as disk space runs out ... not on this one, its fast. period.Few other reviews said it gets hot during operation, but honestly i did not notice anything .. not even getting warm.Also note that this is an SDXC card (different from SDHC), so please check if your device is compatible with it before buying it.",
We have the tap and the echo. I wouldn't buy another tap. It's the voice activation that is so good. But if you don't mind having to push the button for every command then the tap is ok. But for me... only echo.,
good buy on this card. was just what I needed for my tablet. super fast spead on this so up loading or down loading from my pc or laptop is fast.,
Purchased for my cell phone. No problems or complaints. This is my second purchase and so far so good. I have several SanDisk products and have yet to complain.,
"I love this - it expanded the storage of my Nook HD+ (sorry Amazon, I allready had 2 kindles and wanted to see what all the fuss with nook was about- still love my kindles!) from 16 gigs to 80!  Now I have plenty of space for music and movies!",
"This was purchased on a special and the price was right!  It works great, plenty of storage space, and the great price sealed the deal!",
I am only giving this product 3 stars becuse I purchased this one as a replacement for a SanDisk micro SD card that kept having problems with.  I finally got tired of losing my data and ponied up the $20 odd dollars to just replace the darn thing.,
"The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more",
It is whats it is. It does it very well. No hiccups with this disk so far. HD recording works well.,
"Bought this to use in my Galaxy Note 3.  Two months later, works just like is should.  Amazon has the best price available, (and much better price than the offer at Best Buy).",
"I am updating my review from two months ago.. My initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. Today I have been using the Tap and sling daily for over the last two months and I felt like I needed to modify my review. I originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, I am changing my recommendation.The truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. I have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. I think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. Also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.I initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as I thought it would be. I just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.My only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. I am increasing my stars by one. Really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. I have come to really like the sling. I have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. That has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.My original is below. Overall, I would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the Tap.Received the Tap and the Sling cover in the last 24 hours.Read more",
"Super fast, tons of room. Who wouldn't love this micro SD card? The price is even great. I've been using it on my phone for about 6 months now and I've had zero problems. It sped up the processing time of my camera app considerably.",
"I am now having to order my third remote because it randomly dies for no reason. Replacing batteries, attempting to resynch, etc... don't work. It reaches a point where it just stops functioning.On the positive, I love that it's bluetooth and I can use it anywhere in the room without having to point it right at the Fire box.",
"I've had the REPLACEMENT remote 3 months and it's stopped working. If I want to use my Amazon Fire TV (which I love) I have to use my cell phone or my tablet. It defeats the purpose of having voice remote. It also makes me question and second guess whether I should purchase the ECHO. Is it going to quit after 3 months I mean, come on, 30 for 3 months use And it's too late to send it back.",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them.

"I bought three of these--one to replace my old 1 GB card and two for first-time users to add to their phone memory. These cards work fine, and none of the three had any trouble.",
"I use these for cell phone and other devices requiring a MicroSD Card.  This one is compatible with all my devices, even the ones that are &#34;outmoded&#34; like my cell phone.  Works great.  No problems storing or reading data, ever.  I consistently use SanDisk for my cameras, music devices, etc. Highly recommended.",
Most people know that Sandisk is the best. Price is more than competitive for the performance. Works fine in my LG phone.,
"Reliable and inexpensive. However, it's quite slow, far, far slower than the 64GB samsung pro microsdxc. The Samsung works well for interactive use while I would only use this Sandisk card for applications where speed isn't important.",
"What can I say? This card just works. I'm honestly not a fan of Sandisk since their 64GB Ultra MicroSD died on me soon after my baby was born. I lost several weeks of photos, and I was quite angry.To be fair, they did send a new one after I sent them a photo of the old one snapped in half.",
"I was really excited to get this because I hadn't changed my MicroSD card in my phone since I got the original droid.  I was so excited to see how much faster the write/read speeds would be.It worked great at first but then my phone started to tell me that it was unrecognizable and it kept ejecting it. I thought maybe it was a formatting issue so I reformatted it from my phone (Galaxy S4) but it just did the same thing.After a week of this I was very irritated and decided to give up and just return it and get another one. I was scared that it would do the same thing because many other people had issues with these cards in the galaxy's.To my surprise the new 32GB card that amazon sent back to me has been working great where as the other one would have been ejecting every other hour.I am really happy with amazon and their return policy. It was very fast and easy, I can honestly say I've never returned something so fast and so easy, they literally sent it next day delivery and at no cost to me.The only reason I gave it one star off is because I had to return the first one, other than that the product has been great so farI am extremely happy with amazon's service.As far as the SD card I'd definitely get another one if it worked like the one I have now.",
"I purchased this to wxpand the memory in my Asus T100 hybrid windows 8.1 laptop/tablet. It came very quickly and in the easy open package (I hate plastic bublbe packaging). When it arrived I put it in the micro sd slot on my tablet and it just worked.  I got it when it was on sale, so it was a great value too.",
This mem card is fast and does exactly what is supposed to do...save pictures quickly and have plenty of room for more.,
"I have been waiting for these microSDs to not only reach 64GB capacity, but at an affordable price.  Found it!  The package arrived early, worked as advertised, so I am a happy customer.",
"Oddly this device deserves both a five star rating and a 1 star rating at the same time. The things they did right, they did really, really right and blow the competition out of the water but there are serious omissions that I believe an average television watcher is going to surely miss.For watching Amazon content this device is glorious smooth, extremely fast, easy and convenient. The performance is truly impressive and definitely best in class. The voice search worked great for me although I am not pushing it to its limits with a medium range voice and no accent. I love how it was already linked to my account since I purchased it from Amazon, classy touch.Major omissions/annoyances: The remote will not control your TV, so for turning the TV on/off and adjusting volume you will still need another remote.Other content providers (Netflix, Pandora, etc) are not integrated with voice search, so your voice search will only call up Amazon content and to access the others you have to enter into the app explicitly and use an on-screen hunt-and-peck style interface to search. I am hopeful that either the content providers will remedy this in the future or Amazon will sell a bluetooth keyboard for the thing. Perhaps just make my GoogleTV keyboard work :)Also, it does not come with an hdmi cable. Most people probably already have a cable they can use, but I can only imagine the frustration of someone purchasing this and not having the ability to plug it in. This device in its current state will not really replace other devices you have, it would most likely just be an added item for watching Amazon content, so a cable should have been included.Obviously, this is a first impression review (The Fire TV was released yesterday). Some of my first annoyances could be remedied by a future software update, but I don't recommend you buy this product just yet. I am going to keep mine a few days to explore further and then probably send it back. I will update this review.",
Good pair of micro sd card that i bought for my m4/3 camera and phone. Have been using it with my Olympus OMD ME5 camera for a while and before that a Sony Nex 5N and my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. No issues so far and the price is just right.,
"Works perfectly in my gopro black edition and offers a lot of space, very happy overall. would recommend to friends.",
"Don't bother paying for one or getting a replacement, it just isn't worth it.After so many of these things failed so many customers I thought Amazon would come up with a newer, better product but they have not yet.I have gone through three of these things and after the last one died I contacted customer support about it.The guy I spoke to said don't waist your money or your time anymore,upload the Amazon FireTV app on your tablet or phone, it will not fail you.It is not an exact duplicate of the remote face, but it works quite well with both Fire TV and Fire Stick.",
"I love the 64GB capacity, and it is compatible with my devices.  I have one in Go Pro Hero3 and one in a Samsung Galaxy 7&#34; tablet.",
I put this in my GS3 and it works fine. Tons of storage and stuff still loads very quickly and transfers well.,
"Voice remote gave out nearly a year after I purchased. changed batteries several times and nothing. Have to rely on Phone App for it to function. Paid 19 for the stick when it was being promoted to Prime members. Now they want 30 , for an extra 10 might as well buy another Fire Stick, what a rip off for a hollow piece of plastic. Even with the Voice Remote feature, I still don't think it is worth it. Amazon should sell the remote for 10-15 dollars for Prime Members, we shouldn't have to worry if it fails outside of the warranty period. Amazon is already charging an arm and a leg for Prime Membership and its content to begin with.",
"Great price (at the time i purchased it) - sanDisk is known for making great memory cards - use it,in my GoPro",

However, this is very similar to the speed that my GNII's built in storage transfers data at, so when running large applications off of this SD card I see no difference in speed than running apps off of the phone itself.",

The SanDisk 64G thumb drive always had some kind of annoying problem until it finally quit working. Everything I've been told to do to reformat and reset it doesn't help. And FYI, I ALWAYS ejected the drive before I disconnected it. These memory cards from SanDisk that I've bought also have these little headaches all the time. All my Transcend work great and they have been faster to copy my 40G worth of music to. Spend the little extra money if need be and buy the Transcend.",
"Great capacity. I purchased this when I first purchased my phone (Samsung Galaxy S3) and have had no issues with it. Great write speed. Excellent way to store all your music, videos and photos. Great to take videos with as well. More than enough capacity for anything I'd need it for on my phone. Can't go wrong with the SanDisk name either. An industry leader and well known for quality. Of course you always want to backup any and all of your data for continuity purposes, but I've never had any issues with this card.",
perfect price for the 16gb and class 10. I used these in my raspberry PI's they seem to be very fast access and not bogged down.,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"FireTV is basically just what it sounds like: it turns your TV into a giant Kindle Fire. If you are familiar with other streaming media players, youll have an idea of what to expect. FireTV streams video and audio content to your TV from the same providers: Hulu, Netflix, and (of course) Amazon.So lets go through my first experience:Part One: Opening the box (Queue Thus Sprach Zarathustra.)Ok, I have to say it: Nothing impressive here, sorry Amazon. I have to say that the FireTV is about the most boring looking black box Ive ever seen. The good news: It completely disappears on your entertainment center.The remote is pretty bare bones looking. The microphone button grabbed my attention, but otherwise, there are very few buttons. Can I complain that it is both very black and very small Yes, I know that Black is the new Black, but Ive already lost it once and Ive had it for about 2 hours.Ok, enough looky-looky, time to um.hooky-uppy.Part Two: Setup (Where is my That was Easy button)Power: CheckHDMI Cable: CheckTurn on TV: CheckWait for it to bootwaitIts done: Check (That was fast)And done Check Im an Amazon Prime member and my account was already setup on the box and ready to go.Part Three: Interface (What does this button do)Actually, its not rocket science:The Home button takes you back to the home screen.Click the wheel to scroll through options.Hit the button to make your selection.Voice Search: Ok, I will tell you: I am not a big user of voice tech. Really, I hate to use the telephone. I guess Im afraid the pizza guy is going to tell me No But I can see that with a little getting over my own fears, voice search is going to be awesome My FireTV correctly heard all three of my queries. One caveat here: Voice Search only pulls up Amazon content. No a huge deal for my family, but maybe for yours. You can always search the old fashioned way like other streaming boxes.Part Four: Video and AudioAs I said, it was easy to hook up. Just plug it in. Video looked great on my 40 TV. Audio was good over our home stereo. The quality did not seem any better or worse than my other HD set top box.The services available to stream from are also pretty standard fare both on the video and audio front.Part Five: Games (Thousands of games coming)This reminds me a bit of the days when I got the original Kindle Fire. Of course, Amazon made good on their promise there, so I have faith that theyll do the same here. Just a quick view through the list of already available games tells me that there is already a good mix of approved titles for the Fire TV, and more are on the horizon.Please do not mistake this for a NextGen gaming console. It looks like a good choice to be able to play tons of Android games on your big screen.Overall: 4 stars. Fire TV is a very nice mix of old and new. There are a few puzzle pieces missing, but knowing Amazon, theyll be filled in quickly",
i used it on my sony as15. been using it for almost a month now and i have yet to encounter any problem,
Using this for a dash camera we purchased for the car.  It's doing the job - recording the audio and video just fine.,
perfect addition to the Microsoft Surface i purchase for my daughter.  quick and has worked well so far.  SanDisk is a reputable brand.,
I use it to store my music on my android. Works great. Doesn't use that much battery power and doesn't slow down the phone much at all.,
"I bought this for my Galaxy S3 and it worked perfect out the box; no formatting required. It is already Fat32, Works great. Love all the extra space for storing my MP3's and pictures.",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
I purchased a Samsung 7&#34; I primarily use as a reading device. I can now place a number of PDF books to chose from.  Works like a charm.,
I like it. I use it everyday and so far no cons. Im very please.,
"Yes it meet me expectation. This is the best headphone I've had. The Good frequency response and a lot of Bass, which most phones don't have. I would recommend this product to anyone...",
As an photographer I rely on high quality cards for my images...this one does the job and then some.  Two thumbs up !!,
Could not get it to work properly. I put the app on my phone and my computer. I reached out for help. They responded and it still didn't work. I finally got frustrated and returned it.,
"Works as specified, received in good condition from Amazon, using since a few months, in a smartphone, it doesn't get better than this if you're using Sandisk in terms of speed and space. You can expect speeds upto 28 MB/sec for WRITE, about 30MB/sec for READ, with the provided adapter, speeds ar always better for both read/write, using smartphone to read/write, speeds would be lesser mostly, but average should be 20mb/sec anyways as per what I've seen and I'm a heavy user, like if there is a 256GB microSDXC available, I would actually buy it, tried the Extreme version with 80mb/sec, costs 2 times of this one, but works similar to this, so dont waste money on name that doesnt deliver, buy this if you're buying to Sandisk",
"This microSD card is perfect, I'm using this on my Sony DSC-TX200V Cyber-Shot and it works the camera took few second to format card and it was ready to stored pictures and video excellent. The costumer service they help me by replacing my card that broke by sending me a new one and it came super fast the card, I will definitely recommend this card and happy that the costumer service they answer me quick and they werer fast. I will definitely buy from this guys. Thanks...",
Works exactly as it should.  No issues in the Samsung Galaxy s5.  Have not noticed any speed issues as well and I use it plenty for movies.,
Works great.  Plenty of storage and writes fast to my portable camera. Arrived on time. Product was packed and warped well.,
I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys amazon. Excellent value.,
Put this in the Samsung S5.  Works great.  stores lots of pictures and is easy to load and unload. you can also download the pictures to your computer easily.,
"It seems to work fine so far (2 Days with it). What I don't like is how Amazon has made it so thePrime content is mixed with the For Pay content, with no easy way to just see what is ONLY Prime content. This is obviously made to divert you into buying more non Prime content...Amazon, please give us a CLEAR way to view Prime Only if that's what we want. I know we can voice search for anything... and that's great, but sometimes we just want to Go Fishing and would like to fish in the Prime pond only. This is a pretty big deal when you compare this to competing (Think ROKU) products that let you do just that.Hard to believe your competition does a better job with presenting your own content than you do. Maybe an update in the near future will Fix this.",
I like the product itself but its app is very slow esp. outside the U.S. when you are on the go.,
"I have yet to discover all the things this can do. I consider myself a hip almost-50 year old, and have used computers most of my adult life...I waited and researched and finally decided on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 and the Samsung Galaxy smartphone - very happy with both. I'm still having a hard time making the digital leap to downloading books and newspapers. I love reading and listening to music, but still like to hold and smell the pages of the real thing. I can see how fantastic it is while commuting or traveling to have my reading material available in one neat place, on the Kindle..it's just going to take some time. I dumping cable and it was really nice to watch just what I want to watch - it was easy to download Mad Men on the Kindle, and watch when it was convenient. I do have a concern as to what happens when someday, the tablet goes berserk or extinct - do we lose the books and movies downloaded on the Kindle I do not use it to play video games, but the display and picture is very sharp. One aggravating problem I'm having is that Amazon is downloading games and things that I did NOT authorize. Some are free and some show prices with confirmation numbers - I don't appreciate Amazon deciding to download a bunch of crap I don't want and will never use, without my permission - so that is an issue I am trying to address. Otherwise, it's compact enough to fit in most handbags and it's been most useful in meetings and study groups - way nicer than lugging around a laptop (listen to one who had to use a typewriter in college). We've come a long way. I also ordered a reasonably priced Finite folio case/cover from Amazon that works great and allows it to stand.",
"I like this because it works in my transformer tablet and supplies me with plenty of space to play, watch, or listen to what I want.",
"A lot of memories. Works fine with my gopro camera. I thought it was a little expensive but when I see the real price on a store, totally change my mind!",
"I chose this item because of the speed of the memory and also because of the SanDisk brand and I wasn't disappointed.  The memory works fine in my Motorola Razor-M cell phone allowing me to store movies, pictures, and music that I can play on my phone.  The adapter, on the other hand, feels flimsy and fragile.  I had trouble inserting it into two different readers and even then it felt like like it was going to break.  I have several other adapters and this adapter feels like the material is much thinner than the others.  Having said that, I didn't purchase the memory for the adapter I purchased it for the speed rating and compatibility.  All things being equal I would consider purchasing the memory again.",
"I've got mixed feelings on this one, unfortunately. This review is coming from a kindle enthusiast who has owned or used nearly every variation of the device since the 1st generation.Size Weight---It's noticeably smaller and lighter than the Paperwhite. When I saw the specs it didn't really strike me as something that would make much difference to me, but in real life it's actually great. The Voyage fits into a few of my coat pockets that the Paperwhite was just a little too big to fit into.Origami Cover---I know there's a separate product page for the origami cover, but it's worth mentioning here as it is the official cover. The origami cover is ugly and I was skeptical, but I actually love it. It's weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a notepad. This actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open, in my opinion. It's hard to describe, but there are a lot more ways to hold the Voyage when it's attached to this cover, and just generally is more comfortable to use. The origami part of the case works great as well... it stands vertically or horizontally (if you're laying down and reading, this is amazing).The other great new thing about this case is that the Voyage attaches to it magnetically. It attaches and detaches very easily, unlike the Paperwhite which seemed to be nearly permanently attached to the standard case. This is great because if you decide you want to read the device and appreciate how light/thin it is without a case attached, it's super easy to take it out.It's pricey but worth it.PagePress---One of the new features is PagePress, which has sensors on the outer edge of the device that you can squeeze to turn pages.Read more",
Memory card works great in my phone and other micro sdhc compatible devices. Do be sure to look out for the compatibility of your device. Some are not sdhc compatible. Luckily everything I have now is compatible. The 32gb size is excellent especially for embedded devices. I use mine with the Raspberry Pi using the adapter and it's speedy.,
This is a nice card. Holds about 29 GB. You can store data on it. It is a microSDHC card.,
"I am thoroughly impressed with my Echo Dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs. a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop. The construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the Echo. This case/cover will give your Echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in, but still offer the great functionality of Alexa.",
This is a great buy. It work just fine and I use it everyday in my cell phone. The adapter is great when moving files from my computer to my cell phone. Will buy again if the opportunity presents itself.,
Unmounts randomly in mu surface pro 2.  Seems to mostly be centered around write operations.  Trying the samsung version which is sadly much more money.,
"with games being 1-2 gb now a days this card is great for storing all my high graphic games on my note 2 and with the extsd2intsd mod it all goes to my sd card, but thinks its my internal storage which is exactly what i needed.",
16GB Kingston - class 4 - micro SD (Amazon '#1 Best Seller') = 4:30 @ about 5 MB/s16GB SanDisk Ultra - class 10 - micro SD = 2:15 @ about 10MB/sResults from my informal data transfer test. Copied a large 1.3GB video file to my two micro SD cards.This SanDisk Ultra takes about half the time to transfer data. Time is money and I'm happy with the results considering the current Amazon price is about $11 vs $14 for the SanDisk Ultra.,

"I'm a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to compare the latest Kindle to. I don't own a Nook. I don't own an iPad (and, in any case, that's comparing apples to oranges). I don't have a Sony e-reader. 'This will be a short, simple review.I received my Kindle about a week ago and haven't been able to put it down.Things I like about my Kindle1. The e-ink display is amazing.2. Using the 5-way controller is simple and effective.3. Page turn speeds are faster than I thought they would be.4. It's lightweight, even with the attached cover (I have an Amazon cover with a built-in light)5. Page-turning buttons are quiet and well-placed.6. Recharge time is fast.7. I can order a book and start reading it in less than 60 seconds. Nice!8. Portability... I can take 3,000 books with me when I travel for work and not require additional suitcases or baggage fees.Things I'm not too keen on1. Buttons are too close together and are laid out oddly.2. Lack of individual number buttons is frustrating.3. Power button on the bottom Not a bad thing. Just an odd thing. (Same for the headphone input). I usually rest the bottom of a book on my lap when I read.Things I hope change in the future1. How books are organized... When I put a book in a collection (which is actually a tag), it still appears in the main list. It's not actually moved, it's merely associated.2. The look of the main screen. I'd like folders or some other way to display collections.3. Ability to create personal screen savers.4. E-book pricing, though Amazon has little control over this.Read more",
I bought it for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. Her friends even loved it so much they went and bought them too.,
"This is one of the better reviewed SDHC Class 10 cards that utilized UHS. By reading the reviews you will see that it reads/writes at a better speed than many or most cards out there right now. Much depends on your phone, how your phone's OS stores information on a card and what's inside your device. For MOST of us; you probably will not notice anything different between this card and any other GOOD quality card out there. I usually pick the fastest cards on the market when the prices drop. The main problem, speed related is when you transfer large amounts of data (usually music) onto any card. If you use a standard USB 2 connection this card won't speed that process up. If you use a USB 3 or if you actually put this card into a USB 3 reader to do the transfer; then you'll see a nice boost. If your device requires a card that the product can UTILIZE and has the OS and chipset to take advantage of this FAST card; it's a no brainer. If your device is older, if you just like storing music; then you can find a cheaper good quality card. If you find this at a good price no matter what you have... BUY IT",
"Purchased this to drop into my Galaxy Note II. Exactly what I wanted.Loaded up the entirety of the card in about 18 minutes, which is not super fast, but very good considering the card was in the phone instead of in the computer using the include adapter.I purchased this product with the worry-free packaging and was for the first time not frustrated with SanDisk.The Super Saver Shipping really sold the deal to me.The price now is on par with most retailers, but I got two Duds from BestBuy and was good to go with the first one from Amazon, doesn't really say much about the product, but gives you a bit of peace of mind when purchasing from this vendor.",
I use this memory card for a car DVR.  Absolutely no lag in recordings.  The DVR cannot fully use the transfer rates of a class 10 memory card but no issues with recording or sound.  Will buy again and again.,
"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more",
Works great and is very fast.,
"I purchased this card for my parent's ASUS Transformer Tablet as a Christmas gift.  It installed with no issues and they love it.  I made the mistake of buying a no name SD card for my tablet (Motorola Xoom) previously and had to return it as my tablet didn't recognize it.  The SanDisk brand is excellent quality.  I guess it just goes to show you, you get what you pay for.  The Amazon price is good.  Never again will buy cheap for a memory card.",

"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
good speaker. 8 hour battery. Good price. Excellent quality in how it is made.,
"Excellent, my daughter loves this. She can read books, do her school work, watch a few shows, and listen to music. She really enjoys having something that is just for her to use. She is 12 and this was the perfect age appropriate gift that is also extremely functional. I do use the parent settings for some extra security when she is using it unsupervised but otherwise, I do not have a set time limit. Great product.",
Using it in a 10&#34; Android Tablet and have had no issues. Mounted easily and seems to be doing it's job!,
"Tap is a portable Amazon Echo with speakers. Great for carrying to basement or upstairs. Works like echo but not voice activated, you must ""tap"" it before talking.",
Hold a lot of stuff for my phone! Used like 6Gigs for my music. And I have it set to use my card for photo and video. Might do movies on it... But who watches movies on a phone....,
To all the people saying it's too dark. It's literally the same screen as the older devices. Look at comparison. If anything the new Kindle (on right) is lighter than the previous device.,
"My ipod finally bit the dust, so I bought this card to use in my Galaxy 4 so I could use it as my new music player. It was very easy to transfer the music and get it playing right away. I can't complain at all, it was nice to be able to expand my storage on my phone enough with this that I didn't have to go buy another ipod. I have A LOT of music and this thing holds it all and doesn't slow my phone down at all. No complaints here, I actually bought another one of these for my Galaxy Tab so I can keep all my music on that too. So it's safe to say I would buy it again.",
I just added about 35% more space to my windows surface pro with this little gem. (64Gb).  It worked seamlessly.,

"Recently I bought a Microsoft Surface RT tablet and used the 32GB version of this memory card. Worked great and I didn't have any problems. So, when I heard that the Surface RT could be expanded to 64GB, I immediately looked for a great deal online. Behold... Amazon offered this card for under $50 AND it was Prime eligible! Woo-Hoo! To me, it was a &#34;no-brainer&#34; and I quickly ordered this inexpensive upgrade. Like its predecessor, it comes with the memory card, an SD card adapter, and a small plastic case. installing the card is super easy on the Surface, because you just line it up with the slot and push it in till it clicks! That's it! No formatting required and the card runs quite fast! Normally, I buy SanDisk Extreme memory cards (which are faster), but this particular card had no problem running video files or playing music.Anyway, if you get this card for your Surface RT tablet, DON'T format it! Why? Well, the card is already formatted, so why risk messing up your card? Just pop it in and enjoy greater space on your Surface!Note: As far as I know, you cannot install Surface apps onto the memory card, only media files and documents. Still, this card is a great upgrade and I highly recommend it!",

"High speed class 10 memory works great in my new Microsoft Surface RT (saved my over $80 for an addition 32GB from MS). All of my work for the past decade fits into 32GBs. At $19, it costs less than any other class 10 card (in other words, it's the fastest at this price). It's plenty fast for me. But, as reviewer NLee points out, it is very easy to confuse this with much slower class 6 cards (so be careful as you compare). This card worked as soon as I plugged it in - with no problems. Highly recommended. Now, some test the Transend microSD as faster (see first commend for one URL), but performance is more likely limited by your reader. SanDisk is the most popular for good reasons (#1 selling microSDHC card at Amazon). Now, this also means it is the most popular to counterfeit (the likely source of most poor experiences - recent sources estimate that millions have been purchased just on eBay and others have confirmed getting fakes through Amazon vendors).

"Had no issues. The card and adapter worked as promised, and not all sad cards bought on Internet do. Good luck",
Doesn't work in my s2 skyrocket but works in my Xoom. Odd but I have to suffer with it. Seems about the same as my class 4. Will not get sandisk again unless its tons cheaper. 1 was stolen by some tweakers which sucks,
"32 gb card is unredable...tablet cant read it, camera cant read it... Unable to format it... And  i dont havve 20 words...I have 30$ less...",
"memory cards best in world. The memory card completely corresponds to the description. I am happy, my smartphone is happy, my tablet is happy. amazon thanks",
Fast card with the highest capacity you can currently buy in a microSD format. It's probably the fastest microSD of this size also.,
"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more",
You buy a several-hundred-dollars-worth product and then you add up a cheap SD card? What a shame! Go for a Class 10 SanDisk card!! They are very fast and reliable. I use it with my Lumix camera and my brother's just bought it for his Galaxy S4 mini...,
So far this sandisk ultra is working ok.I ran a few tests on it from within my phone before i began using it and the speed was well within reason.it does not read and write at the same speed.so far so good i guess,
Many devices still don't work well with 64GB capacity cards. These 32GB cards are often available on sell for a great price and work fantastically.,
"This card is awesome and even seems to make my phone run faster, I would say that it is a must have for all!!!",
Swapped this into my GoPro and put the 32gb card from there into my S4. In both cases I'm completely satisfied with the cards.,
"SanDisk is a very reliable name in storage.  This Micro SD card is no exception.  Lots of storage at a good price, this is a must for tablets and cell phones with limited on-board memory.",
I got the 16GB card for my Garmin GPS. The GPS's memory could be expanded so that more maps and info could be saved. The memory card works as described. I've used Sandisk for many electronics and I have never had a problem. They are sometimes a little more expensive than other brands but I think the little extra is worth it.,
What can I say - its a memory card. It remembers what its supposed to. At least it remembers as well or better than I do.Only problem I have with these Micro SD cards is - they're so small they're easy to lose. If these things get any smaller we will start inhaling them by accident when we sneeze or something.,
"At the time of writing this review I bought three of these memory cards in last couple of weeks, for work related phones. They work fine in the Samsung Galaxy S3 mini phones. We are happy with the read and write speeds. One small note of caution the price that can be paid for these can vary, so please check around and save a few extra dollars. When installed you will not get the full 32Gb from the SD card - but that is to be expected, so please bear this mind.",
Purchased these to use in Contour Roam cameras. Records quality videos and downloads fast.  Highly recommend these cards for your micro SD card devices.,
"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysJuly 30, 2014Hi Dallas, thank you for sharing your feedback.

"the price is good, it worked as expected, there is not much more to say about it. Have not tested the adapter.",
This memory works in Samsung Smartphones .It is a fast memorySandisk is the most reliable memories in the market,
Memory is typically a go/no go kind of deal - speeds can also be a factor but in reality I have nothing to really challenge the speed claims of this memory so that is a moot point.,
"Man, this 128 (122gb actually) is amazing!  I had a 64gb card and been transferring my apps to the external card and ran out of memory.  With this bad boy, I can move anything I want, load it with tons of music and still have tons of space.  Highly recommended.",
I bought one but it died on my galaxy s4 but i sent it in to sand disk and they sent a brand new one.,
No formatting needed. Plug it in and it just works.Best Buy sells this same card for $100. They do price matching if you can't wait for this to be shipped.,
A must have for those who have android products with expandable memory slots...the go to place to save your pictures and videos so if you change phones or tablets you won't lose your memories.,
"I bought this to replace the 32GB microSD I had in my phone that up and died on me.  This one is still kicking, so I guess that's a good thing.  It's been about 6 months and all is good.",
i don't get the class 10 stuff but the higher the number the better from what I have reseached.  I have it for my smart phone and works fine.,
San Disk makes good cards however i thing the price is somewhat high.So I got the 32GB for half the price so i will have to download my pictures twice a month instead of once a month,
"Solid SDHC card that is fast (at reading and writing) fast (for recording video and pics), has great capacity, and is reasonably priced. I have had no issues with it.Overall, highly recommend.",
"Buying two of the 32GB cards is even cheaper than buying one 64GB, too. It's a really is a solid value.",
"i always buy sandisk because of their reputation, they make a great product and have never had any problems with these sd cards.",
"now, two phones later, and still have never had a problem! dont think, just buy it!Now im just waiting for 128gb chips haha",
"see,,, I own an HTC HD2 with cyanogen Android Rom on it,, I wanted maximum memory capacity for various storage needs including shooting HQ videos ,,, I used to have a patriot 32GB Class 10 on it but the performance wasn't up to my expectations ,,,this badboy right here peroformed like a champ on my smartphone ,,, Alert : ""IT WORKS ON HTC HD2"" ,,,,once I popped this card on my laptop to transfer my data on it,,, I got no less than 14MB\S write speed which is above the specs of the this card,,,Apps access in FAAAST ,,, so far I'm pleased with it ,,, I'll update this after a While when I use it intensively ,,,well done SanDisk ,,,",
Bought from BestBuy online the day it was announced. I have tested in my Sony Xperia Z Ultra and my 12inch Samsung Pro tablet.Both work fine. Shows 119GB available. Only issue I have is that I paid 199.99 for it :(Best Buy will most likely match this though.,
Very pleased with the speed and performance of this memory card.  Use it in both my camera and smart phone.,
"I was not interested in this because of its small size, flash and now with 64 became excited to use.",
"This thing does it's job perfectly, it's light weight and provides great protection. Not worried about it when in the little ones hands (or not as the case may be)!",
"Very fast! Decent price.I use this for my phone, and it does the job. Never had any problems, it's a class 10 card so it has plenty of speed for reading and writing. Will buy again =)",
"Best, most reliable microSD card you can get. I use it for all my devices; phones, tablets, cameras, camcorders, GoPro cameras...",
"you can film up to 2:30 hours with it, and 4000 pictures on 5MP so no bad for what i need.",
"I bought this for my mother in law to use when she is outside gardening. She had a huuuge portable speaker that didn't sound very good and used many double 'd' batteries. This one sounds better and lasts all day. I was concerned she wouldn't be able to figure it out, but it is so user friendly she has no issues with it. She loves it and that is a good thing.",
"So happy with my new fire and I wish I had bought more! Some of the PROS of this tablet are it has Alexa, Memory expansion slot, and a nice size. At 8 inches it is the perfect size to take on the go and Ebook . It is a little thicker than some of the more expensive tablets on the market but because of this it seems more durable especially for kids. The apps and games seem to run smoothly and the colors are good on screen. I install the Google Play store and Connect to the google play store to download apps is easy, like youtube. Without the Google Play store you will stuck with the Amazon store and apps.I often use the tablet to watch videos with my meidong E6 bluetooth headphones Meidong E6ANC Bluetooth Headphones Active Noise Cancelling Headphones Wireless Stereo headphones with Microphone, Ergonomic Design for Kids Adult-Black this is a excellent headphones with noise cancelling at an affordable price if you are looking for, this is right for you. And it has two colors for choice, black and rosegold,I have bought two. I did some research and found that the meidong company is an audio electronics innovator specializing in bluetooth/ANC headphones, vibration speakers,wifi speakers. No wonder their headphones sound really nice, also recommend.Back to here,The only 1 CONS I would say about that The tablet has two camera, rear is 2mp and front is 0.3mp, very very basic. Having two speakers but the speaker is not great.Overall, it is a good value for the price,This tablet can do whatever other tablets those cost twice or triple the price do.",
It has worked perfectly for last few weeks. I am using it in a Garmin dash cam system. It has replaced the original 4Gig chip originally supplied with the unit. I have been using Sandisk chips for over ten years with absolutely no issues. This is top of the food chain for SD micro chips.,
"the site is very reasonably priced unit memory added to my Samsung galaxy no pro-12.2, 64 GB. It also helped expand the memory in this to allow for better storage of songs, information, and I believe it to be a good value.",
"hard to use, and does not support Guam. online instructions not clear",
Samsung is my preferred memory brand but SanDisk runs a close 2nd. 64 GB should be great when I upgrade my Motorola RAZR to a new Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with it's 16 MP camera.,
Using it with action cameras and they work just fine with no issues.  Tend to be getting around 2hrs when filming at 1080p @30fps for the 16gb card,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
this memory to buy a video camera and a cell the probe with camera and battery first just the memory capacity,
"Great card. just what I was looking for, for my surface. Now I need nine more words for Amazon limit.",
"shipping was fast,item arrived on time,item is the new ultra high speed(UHS-1) standard of memory card and it works very fast in read and write speeds and watching bluray movies,customer is happy as well",
"This card has met my every expectation.  I use it for still pictures and video streaming in my Samsung camera, and thus far no problems at all.",
"The new Fire HDX 8.9 is definitely one powerful tablet, packed with some pretty nice features. While it does have some small flaws here and there, it generally is an all around great buy. I'll go over some of what I've noticed using the tablet, what I've learned from others who are using it, as well as the specs and how I feel about them. Hopefully it'll give you more insight into the product and help you make an easier decision whether or not to buy it.*** BUILD QUALITY ***One of the first things I noticed was the outstanding build quality. The tablet weighs less than much of its competition, and provides a nice feel due to the materials used in making the case which gives you a nice grip so you don't drop the tablet as easily. Everything feels solid... it doesn't have that cheap feel that some of the Android based tablets have. Apple still holds the title for most durable case as it's aluminum but unless you plan on throwing this thing around, you don't need the aluminum... it weighs more and it's cold!*** SNAPDRAGON PROCESSOR AND GPU ***This new HDX 8.9 comes with the 2.5Ghz Snapdragon processor and a nice GPU so this is going to be one of your fastest tablets on the market at the moment, if not the fastest. Intel and NVIDIA are continuously working on CPU's for the tablet and Chromebook markets, bragging about their performance and how they blow away the competition. Acer, for example, is utilizing an NVIDIA Tegra K1 ARM based CPU running at 2.1GHz quad-core. That is insanely fast for something like a Chromebook which functionality wise, is pretty much the same thing as a tablet. Unfortunately for Acer, the Snapdragon CPU on the Fire HDX is more powerful (2.5 GHz vs. 2.1 GHz) and appears to be using less power.Read more",
"Works well in Samsung S4, laptop & HD video camera.Replaces SD that caused weird losses & errors in Samsung SGH-M919 phone.  Several other SD cards have refused writes, lost data or had mount problems. SanDisk 32 GB memory has worked perfectly in several devices & 3 operating systems.",
SanDisk provides dependable storage for my new tablet. SanDisk is what I rely on for my phone and computers.  Has never let me down.,
I got this to go in my smart phone and it does the job great!  Inexpensive and it includes an adaptor card so I can use it in applications without a micro-SD slot.  This expands its versatility.,
"I purchased this product to install in my Garmin GPS unit, since it was full and couldn't handle the new map updates. Easily and securely installed, this memory card promises to provide a long life to my GPS unit.",
All the horror stories about SD memory not really being the density reported.  I loaded two of these things to the max.  All data is accessible.,
Phone is a galaxy s3 from virgin. Still getting sd card unexpectedly removed but I do know it's an issue with the phone and not the card.,
lots of memory and it come with the adapter that makes it easer to connect to your computer or other devices.,
Fits perfect on the new Fire 8 kids tablet!! Thanks so much for another great product!,
I got this for my gopro hero 3. Works great and reads/ writes fast. Customer service was also awesome as well.,
"I installed this in my phone to take advantage of extra space for downloaded movies and games. Seems fast, cool.",
"I was using mine in a GoPro Hero 3.  The card just broke for no reason.  There is controversy weather its the GoPro or SanDisk, but after doing some Google research it seems that its more of SanDisk's fault as these SD cards also fail (or used to) in varies Samsung devices (phones / tablets).  Amazon sent me a replacement, so no harm done, but for the money you would expect something top notch.GoPro users (on the support forums) recommend getting 2x32GB SD cards, which have not had any issues as far as anyone knows.  The worst part is losing important content, I was lucky, I copied my movies from the SD card onto a HD on my PC.  Others not so lucky.",
The Amazon Tap has great sound and is responsive to requests for the songs and music I like. It has a rechargeable battery and is portable which is great for taking your music with you as you move around. Thumbs up for the Tap!,
"I use these in my tablet as well as my camera. I find slower speed cards do not work well when taking pictures or video. It would be nice if the SD adapter had built in WiFi, that way for my DSLR, I would only need to buy one WiFi card and simply replace it with these micro SD cards and save money.",
"This card no longer is readable by three different phones after only six months of very light usage (very few pictures had been saved to the card), where it was never taken in or out of the phone before it showed signs of dying (thus the death was not caused by excessive handling of the card).",
It's a good capacity but the speed is slow that is almost 10M...but it's acceptable to me. I like it.,
64GB...delivered fast and installed quick! Works like it should at reasonable price. I only wish I could get more memory in my Note 3...so much media!!,
I do like the portability of my Tap. You do lose some features from the Echo - like speaking to it from across the room. But i'm happy with it and it has good sound. great to take out by the pool!,
"Easy to install, good performance, can be used in phone, photo machines, computer. Now i have extra space in my cell phone.",
I never faced any issues ...so far..so good. It works well with my tablet. It is super fast and reliable.,
"Tony the Tiger has nothing on this deal. It was only $1 more for this chip than it is for the generic version from Micro Center, so I could not resist. I tossed this into a Samsung Galaxy Note II, which I also love.",

THE SANDISK ULTRS 64 GB MICROSDXC CLASS 10 UHS-1 MEMORY CARD WORK GOOD IN MY ATIV SMART 500T SAMSUNG WITH ADAPTER,
I bought this for my husband and then the 32 GB one went on sale so I bought that one for him. I use this one in my Tablet and I love it! No issues!!,
"I've tried several brands of microSD cards in various smartphones and this SanDisk card is by far the fastest and most reliable card I've used.  Like others have mentioned, I did have to format it using the tool from sdcard.org but once I did, it was faster than any other card I have ever used.  Completely error free and no issues whatsoever",
I needed  this for my new phone. It works great!SanDisk is a good brand so I didn't hesitate to purchase it.,
"Thoughts of being able to have the Echo ""grow"" as I added to the list of tasks, excited me. Including the latest app, having it to recognize my smartphone's contact list to place and to receive calls. However, the Echo I purchased does not link up to my Samsung smartphone. Disappointed is a understatement.",
This is the third sd card I've bought. All have performed outstanding. Great for use in my cellphone and tablet.I definitely recommend this card.,
This speaker's forte is it's drop and charge ability. It does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with. The sound quality though is ok...Def not very loud and lacks the lows. But for a small portable speaker which is not expensive I would recommend it.,
I quadrupled the memory in my Windows Surface with a tiny push of the Memory card into the allotted slot. Way to go SanDisk.,
This item is great!  I can't believe how small it is.  Imagine 64gb this size back in the 70's when they had whole buildings full of computers that couldn't pack this much space!  Great item.,
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more",
"I love the Amazon Fire TV but . . . (I considered giving it only 3 stars for the comments listed below, but I really like it)OK, after only owning the Amazon Fire TV since last Friday, April 4th, I suspected the limited 8GB of internal memory would be a problem and it is.As of last night, April 9th, my Fire TV internal storage was full. I was trying to install the Deus Ex game that is available for Fire TV and received that message that I needed to delete something. So, I started deleting a few games and finally had enough deleted that it started downloading again except I think it started all over again. About 90 of the way through downloading the 2ND TIME, I got the same message to delete some more. So, I deleted a few more games and then it took off downloading again from the beginning again Then, it completed the download and started installing the game and then I got the same message again for a 3RD TIME That made me say a few choice wordsAt that point, I said to heck with it and figured I'd wait to see if Amazon does anything about this. So, I spent 7 on a game I didn't get to play. See, the USB port isn't enabled so there is no support for external storage. From what I saw, the Fire TV App takes up 2.2 GB of the total 8GB available. Heck, The Walking Dead app alone is over 1GB in size. I can't verify this but I swear each time I was downloading Deus Ex it used up another 700+ MB of memory and when the download didn't complete I didn't get the storage back So, in (3) attempts to get it installed I swear I used up 2 to 3 GB of internal storage that is still gone. I was looking through all of the apps/games that I have installed and didn't add it up but I really don't have that much installed right now and it only looks like it amounts to 2 to 3GB but where the other 2 to 3GB is, is a mystery. I deleted like (8) total games with a couple of them in the 400 to 500MB range and never got Deus Ex installed.Amazon needs to get this fixed fast for anybody that purchased the Fire TV for any sort of Android gaming purposes. Just hope they fix it faster than OUYA did which took like 6 months plus to enable external storage.I would like to add, that it is a huge engineering oversight, in my opinion, to only give the Fire TV 8GB of internal store. Just enable the USB port to allow for external store I would gladly go out and buy a 15 32GB USB memory stick or even spend the 50 to 60 on a 500GB external hard drive.In this day and age, the Fire TV should come with at least 32GB of internal storage That would allow for at least the storage of (60) 500 MB game considering maybe 2GB would be used up for the Amazon Fire TV app. That would be reasonable and fair.Today, 2.2 GB is used for the Fire TV app leaving less than 6GB of internal store. Considering The Walking Dead is over 1GB just by itself, that leaves only 5GB left. What is left only allows for (10) more 500MB games. So, a system that only allows the installation of (10) to (12) games/apps at 500MB each clearly isn't big enough.",
"Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version. For my 7 version review, please search for my HDX 7 review.My profile: Im a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do. It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more",

There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
I would recommend this Prouducts it had great full sound full sound with a conpack,
"I own a roku and apple tv and have to say that the Amazon Fire TV falls into more of the apple tv category. It's definitely a walled garden of content that feeds you into amazon's prime tv offerings. You can access a lot of titles there for pay and often less expensively than On Demand options available from your cable provider.However, for your prime investment, there are no free titles. I'd love to see Amazon take a netflix model for a certain number of older titles. The price barrier keeps me from watching older titles, but the prices of latest releases are about average and worth it.The interface is great. I find the voice activation to be really accurate and easy to use. It's really how you are meant to navigate the massive number of options available.Performance is best in class as the Fire TV has a quad core processor that is unmatched by any other provider. I'd love to see a great game title arrive on the box that would make the game controller worth the investment. However, for an all-in-one, solution the game selection can definitely hit the spot.I use the plex and netflix apps available for this device and they perform great. Certainly, there's no blu-ray player that can match the capability of this device.All-in-all I definitely recommend this device to anyone, but still prefer the Roku since Roku isn't selling its own content service, so it agnostically serves a lot of free content that you didn't even know existed.",
It failed after about one year of using on a samsung Galaxy s4. Now I contacted Sandisk for a potential replacement. I can't format it or do anythin wiith it.,
"This card does exactly what it should.  Class-10 performance at a fair price in a MicroSD format.  It should be faster though, and in fact there are options out there now at a nominally higher price that do, including the &#34;extreme&#34; versions from the same vendor.",
"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go. Until now, nobody quite got it right. In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software. I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon. We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon. The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone. Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands. To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without. Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try. Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!Update: After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.1. Use the best speakers you can with it. I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.2. Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.Read more",
I ordered this to use with my new Samsung Galaxy SII phone.  I've used SanDisk in the past and have always had great luck with their products. I would definitely recommend this product.,
"I bought this specifically for my COWON J3, as it comes with 32gb of internal memory, adding 64gb got me almost to 100gb. That's 3x the original capacity that player has.This card is formattable to FAT32, thus allowing you to use it with some of the older SDHC devices. I know not many of the buyers will even consider this ability, but I figured I'd throw it there for those that might be interested.The card is fast, I'd post benchmarks but you can just google for a ton available already. Also with 30mb/s speeds this wouldn't make a bad Camera SD card if you absolutely needed one someday. Just stick it in the SD adapter and you're rolling.I tested it with my Canon T3i, worked flawlessly, however, not as fast as my other 90mb/s card.",
Great price on this product.  Half of what Samsung was charging for the same memory card. Works just fine in my Notewith no pproblems what so ever.,
"Excellent brand, as good as any of the other cards I've ever used. Highly recommended for any appropriate uses. I like all of the San Disk products.",
"Seems to be authentic.  Great speed, correct capacity, and works flawlessly with my samsung phone and card readers.  Would buy again if needed for another device.",
"Awesome microSD card.. no issues and I have several of these and has performed well in my gopro, SG4 and Note 2.",
"For the love of god do not buy this!!! Thought it was great at first since it didn't add any size to the phone given that it sticks to the face. Well, at least its supposed to. Lasted three days and came of the phone and now can't do anything with it since the adhesive no longer holds. 25 for this piece of junk! What was I thinking",
"My first computer had 64k of RAM.I just put this in my GoPro Hero camera. It has 1,000,000 time more memory. It is great and it works great too.I just initialized it in the the GoPro and I'm saving pictures.Fantastic",
A well made replacement part for use with my system.  Reads and writes quickly to my camera.  The down side:  I do not like the size of this card.  Very tiny and often difficult to remove from my Canon camera.  Not a reflection on the San Disk card quality but the industry move into micro-miniture cards.  I won't buy another camera using micro SD cards.,
"The GoPro seems a bit finicky about card speeds since the last firmware upgrade I applied. The cards I've been using for quite a long time started causing it to randomly report errors and stop recording. I got a couple of these SanDisk cards and I've got the Hero powered via the USB port so I can fill the cards repeatedly without running out of battery. No errors reported so far, and I've completely filled one card twice and the other three times.I haven't always had the best luck with SanDisk but these are working well so far. Fingers crossed that they last a while, I use the camera to record off-road and &#34;brisk&#34; dual-sport rides.",
"This works perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 new cell phone, greatly expanding memory. It installs very quickly and easily. easily",
"This disk is great. Really fast read and write, no lag time at all. Using it with go pro black.  Also comes with an adaptor that fits in your computer.",
"Picked this up on sale.. doesn't work, only shows up as a 1MB (yes, Megabyte) card that I can'd do anything with.  I already threw away the original packaging too.  I'm sure returning it is going to be a huge PITA because of that.UPDATE: After writing this (albeit, short) review I found this is not uncommon.  I also found that this card was deliberately crippled despite the product description saying ""The SanDisk Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Card works with any microSDXC compatible device.""  That was all the motivation I needed to process a return on it rather than having it replaced.",
So far this item is great. Purchased one for myself and then one for my niece for her phone for XMAS. Another plus the shipping was great.,
I bought this product in order to use with my Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet. It works as advertised and allows files to be stored on this memory instead of tablets memory. I re-formatted it to use NTFS mode and have not noticed any problems.DS,
"I have used this brand for a while, and no complaints...  writing HD video to them quite often no issues.",
"Nice Item and I have ordered several for my smartphone, tablets and so far they work great so if you need more space order",
"Using it with my HTC One Max, and had no problems using it at all.  Write speed is excellent when taking picture, and no delay is encountered at all.",
I just love this because i just got a new smart phone and now i am ready to do some down loading.,
I only buy thru Amazon I've tried eBay and you always come thru and I got messed over four times and no real recourse you just lose and PayPal is nobodies pal. And these no more rack are terrible and all these others take my advise stick with the one that has always came thru every time for me. Amazon and only Amazon . H.Rhodes,
"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
"This was a great price, shipped lightning fast, I'll be buying from this seller again. We purchased this for our mom/grandma for mother's day, she loves it. This little fire will do everything she does on line and then some. we went with the fire hdx because this is an e reader, a browser, it plays amazon prime video, and it will skype. I would recommend this to everyone if your looking for a multi-function tablet it's wonderful",
"By far the best MicroSD card I've ever used. It's precise, fast and secure, what more can you ask for? Whether it was photos, music or even a few movies, this recorded, played and transferred data flawlessly. Very highly recommend",
"I have purchased 2 of these cards.  I have attempted to use them in my GoPro HeroHD, Samsung Galaxy S4, Asus TF700, and in all of them they end up corrupting out of the blue with no warning.  I then have to perform a deep recovery to get the files.  I will never buy these Ultra models again.",
for the price this memory card works well and i have not had any issues with it in the surface,
"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more",
"Have had this card for months, and used it on a Sansa Clip+, LG Optimus One (P500h), LG G (E970), Asus MeMO Pad, and of course on a whole lot of readers for PC.",
Works perfectly. I can take the microSDHC from my Galaxy Player and use the adaptor to plug it into my iMac with no problem at all.,
Always bought Sandisk memories for my cameras and still satisfied. This time bought for the Galaxy SIII. The speed (Class 10) and reliability are worth.--Sempre comprei mem&oacute;rias da Sandisk para minhas cmeras e continuo satisfeito. Desta vez comprei para o Galaxy SIII. A velocidade (classe 10) e confiabilidade valem a pena.,
I bought this to add additional storage for my MP3 player.  I now have a ton of music and audio books on my MP3 player. It will take awhile to listen to all of it!,
"works as expected and was nice that it came with a holder. Not sure what else you can say about a chip, either it works or it don't? One never knows until they use it for a while how it is working...",
"I've requested a replacement, so I'll update this review after I receive a replacement.  But the first card I got, it could be read, but every time I put it into the computer, it said there were errors with it.  It couldn't repair the errors.  I couldn't even format it using a command prompt to try and get it to work.  I could create folders on the card, but not put anything into them or onto the card other than folders.  I tried many many things and nothing worked.  I know SanDisk makes decent products, so I will change the review later.",
"I have alway bought this brand, for some reason about a month ago I got some other brand, bad move!!!!! I ended up getting my money back, then I bought me this one, works like a champ, this is way to go!!!!",
I've had a couple of these crap out on me but so far this one is my first heavy duty one. It's very fast and responsive. I just hope it can last better than some of the others I've had.,
get this for my hct phone it works great . not slow like some others i have had . but i didnt know about classes  for memery cards with the othere ones . good card . done not freeze or loose anything,
"When I opened the micro disc and adapter I did't know what to do with them. I went to UTube on installing them, and all became clear. The micro fits into the top of the adapter and then the whole thing fits into my camera. Very neat and high powered.",
"There's really not much to say. I put it right into my S4 when it arrived and have not had any issues ever since. Very nice card with plenty of room for my music, photos, videos, and whatever else I cram on my phone.",
Awesome speaker easy to set up. Easy to play. Great by the pool,
"Comes in an open package, no box included except for the instruction manual/warranty. Using this on my cell phone and works great. Read/Write speeds are noticeably faster than my old Sandisk 32gb MicroSD.",
More than a year in and still going strong. It boosts the memory of the tablet so I can store movies for trips and the tablet stores big files there automatically to save it's own brain for more important things.,
I put this into my new tablet before I went on a long road trip and I was able to watch a few movies off of it during a 12 hour bus ride.,
"Works but there is a trick to it. So I purchase a Lenovo Yoga 10 tablet and installed the card and it told me the card was damaged, I put the card in my PC and it worked fine, I even reformatted it in the PC, still no luck. Called Lenovo and they walked me through formatting it again in the PC and still didn't work BUT there was an option in the Android software that is a status screen (pull down from the top of the screen) and that gave me a choice to let me format it in the tablet and after it completed it I was good to go, it mounted and I downloaded my 318 songs on it and it is working like a charm. Only thing I can think of is that Android doesn't like the way SanDisk formats their cards. I think if everyone knew about this there would be a lot less returns.",
We really enjoy our Alexa. I always have it for music. Lately we been movie times. The kids like to ask it silly questions and they can't get enough of it,
I got this to use in my mother's digital camcorder. It offered good value and with the adapter it insures that the card can be used anywhere. My mom was very happy with the extra capacity this card provided her to film my niece and nephew.,
Bought for my Note 3.  Works as advertised. 64gb and class 10 speeds offer great capacity and read/write speeds for HD viewing and recording.,
"Everything is working as expected.The product is very good, the speed transfer is OK.I use it with my Xperia SmartPhone",
"I love this product and that you can take ""Alexa"" everywhere with you because it is a portable speaker. You can connect it to your phone when away from a WiFi building. The speaker is great, it is surrounded by cloth, which I would worry about it getting dirty. The one downside to the tap compared to the Echo Dot or the OG Echo is that Alexa is not always listening and for her to work on the Tap, you have to press the speaker button. Pretty self explanatory name. You have to ""tap"" the tap. I ended up returning it to get the dot. But, like I said, great speaker, great portable device.",
"After I inserted the micro SD card to the adapter I can no longer removed it from the adapter. It was stuck inside the adapter permanently. I definitely received a defective item. I also read a lot of reviews saying this card have bad sectors.Another, while I was transferring from my computer the transferring of files suddenly stopped and said there was an error.Sandisk's quality control department should up their game. They're selling products to the general public that are defective and flawed (not all of them BUT a lot of them). It's just not me. I also read a lot of reviews saying the card they got were also defective.",
Everyone should buy this product who likes to record with their dslr.. Works great with my canon dslr.. Great product..,
"I have never been happier, or more excited about a purchase anywhere, anytime ever Amazon really does blow all other competition out of the water with this creation It is very user friendly, fast, and fun I am so glad I got it and would highly recommend it",
"This one really does not have bubble problems, yes because the screen part is actually thinner than side part thus it is actually floating above the screen. While it cause a problem that the touch screen is not as sensitive than in the previous time. Secondly it is really soft actually thus it will be scratched easily by anything near your cellphone such as keys or coins. I would like to say that design is okay, but it is not satisfactory as a screen protector.",
"It's fast fast fast, and big big big.  It's exactly what you need to record all of your ill-advised shenanigans with your friends.",
"This is perfect!  I picked this up on Amazon for $25, and I could not be happier!I've used this on various devices such as Surface RT, camcorder, laptop and it works without any problems!",
was able to increase storage on my Surface RT. No more carrying around an external hdd. Holds enough of my music library.,
"Pros and consPros1. It's fast2. It works in my Galaxy Note 3 (also works in my gf's Galaxy Note 2 and my brother's Galaxy S4)3. I got it on sale. Sales rock.4. It's half red, which makes it harder to lose than all-black ones.5. Comes with a MicroSD-to-SD converter so you can use it in stuff like cameras and SD card slots on your computer. Wildly useful for non-phone transfers and uses.Cons1. None yet. We'll have to see how long it lasts.",
What more can be said?  This card is made by the leader in flash memory and was a reasonable price and very fast.,
"this is a very good product, the speakers are good, the price was right. I liked everything about it, other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it, unlike the echo and the dot. The portability was good, but I didn't have much use for it being portable. Unless you are going to keep the Tap within arm's reach, you're better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products. recommended with caveats",
Excellent. Got 2 of these but still testing to see if speed is its greatest deal. Anyway Cheap at the time.,
My only problem is that I have not been able to use its full potential.,
The card was good.  Haven't had a problem with it yet.  Good price.  Fit the product I bought it for.,
"Disappointing Kindle.Charging is sometimes interrupted by loss of connection between cover and Kindle. Complained and they sent me another cover. It works better, but still looses connectivity from time to time. Have to stop and disconnect cover and reconnect it. That usually stops the problem for a while.Also, It is not clear from the sales materials that the Premium Leather cover is suede. it shows scratches from fingernails.On the plus side, the Oasis screen is good and the quality of the text is excellent. Lighting is even and reading is easy on this device.",
"Price was right, shipping quick, Class 10 card for HD video in my GoPro.Hard to rate it since memory cards are pretty much memory cards. Nothing jumps out as excellent so that is why 4 of 5.",
"I went to update my Garmin GPS with the latest maps and it told me that the entire map wouldn't fit (US, Canada and Mexico). It said I could put the maps on an SD card to get the whole map set or else I had to pick only a portion of the lower 48 states (it wouldn't even fit the entire US only). t don't understand why as everything fit before.So, I picked up this SD card for the unit and it worked perfect. I now have the entire map set on the GPS. I just have to always leave the SD card in the unit which for me, isn't a big deal as I wasn't using the SD card for anything else before.",
"I using this micro sd on my Sony Xperia Z, It's running fast and has a lot of space, now I can store all my data on this card",
"I bought these microSDXC cards for use in my tablet, however, my tablet only recognizes FAT32 formatted cards and not the exFAT that these cards use. I had suspicions about this based upon other reviewers' experiences. Windows computers will not reformat in FAT32 beyond the 32 GB limit. I was able to locate a small program that would reformat a drive to FAT32 without the 32GB limitation (FAT32 can accommodate up to a 3 TB drive). I used the Windows GUI version of fat32format (freeware) and it quickly reformatted the memory card. Now the card works in my tablet.",
"I switched off unlimited data for Verizon so I wanted to get something that'll store all my mp3s on my phone easily so when I'm out and about I don't use my data to stream it.This card was great, I put it in my phone, went to phone settings to format microsd and connected it to my pc and loaded all my songs to the SD card with plenty of room left over.",
the 64 gb class 10 memory will be useful and I think this was a good buy.I will be using it in my GoPro Hero 3 Black.,
"Popped it into a Surface laptop/tablet. It worked straight way.Little card has a big memory by today's standards. But in the morrow of the future it won't bemuch space. For now, this is the maximum space for a MicroSDHC card. There ain't no card bigger than this. There ain't no 128 or 256 Gbs MicroSDHC card.Good deal. Fast arrival.What more can I write.",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears.

This card is very responsive and never encountered a single issue. Works great in very cold or hot weather! I am using it when skiing and it is often exposed to very cold weather. I have stored so far few hundred hours of video over multiple events and not a glitch. Would buy again for sure.,
I have a MacBook Air and was curious if could put a TimeMachine backup on an SD Card.  For the experiment picked the SanDisk because:I've had great luck with their cards in the pastUsing a microSD gives me the most options with changing tech going forwardAmazon had it for $64 while it was $99 at Best Buy.Well guess what it works great!.,
"THis is GREAT for my tablet, OMG I have SO MUCH STUFF on storage that it would take me forever to read, listen, and watch it all. Very nice. Very nice indeed.",
"Got this for my galaxy s3, fits well works fine. I moved all my stuff from the phone to the card and working great!",
The SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter handles its job as you would expect from SanDisk.,
"For me 32 gb is sufficient. I don't need more then this.Running easy, safety, and SanDisk is a great mark.",
"Nothing beats class 10 SDHC, I would highly recommendfor anyone that requires memory, especially for this low price. There is nothing better.",
"It was a Good value for money , Product was delivered on time and in good condition. I am using it with my tablet and am happy with the performance.",
"I installed these on my Samsung Note 3 and S4 and have not had a single issue. Plenty of space for music, photos, videos, and apps.",
I BOUGHT THIS FOR A TABLET THAT I BOUGHT (Alldaymall(TM) A70X 7 Inch Android 4.2 4 GB A20 Dual-Core Tablet PC) I WAS SKEPTIAL AT FIRST BUT IT WORKED GREAT FOR MY TABLET AND FOR THE PRICE IT BOOSTED MY MEMORY FROM 4 GB TO 36 GB IN TOTAL GOOD PRODUCT!,
"Allow me to preface this with a little history. I am (was) a casual reader who owned a Nook Simple Touch from 2011. I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you.",
Arrived on time and was exactly as stated.  A good value for the amount of storage.  Will be filling it up with music.,
"We have 3 of these and so far it is my favorite microsd card, fast and so far no problems.",
"I bought this for myself as my first kindle! This is the best deal you can get on a kindle, especially with the 30 off if you're a prime member. This is the original kindle that is 80 that comes with a case, no ads, and a protection plan. The case is magnetic, not the greatest quality, but it will do perfect for me for a year or so. I connected easily to my library account and to my other books already downloaded on my kindle app. It automatically connected to my amazon prime account. I love it! This deal will not disappoint!",
"I really like the performance.  Since I put it into a USB 3.0 adapter, I get about 27MB/s actual measured throughput.",
"I have lately purchased two micro-SD card one Sandisk Ultra 64GB microSDXC and 1 Sandisk Extreme Pro microSDHC 16GB. The first one claim 30MB/s the second claims 90-95MB/s. I 5 tests on my Galaxy Note 2 and 3 different benchmark test on my computer using USB 3.0 card reader. I can only get 7-8MB/s (this not even class 10, let alone UHS-1). I even did real world testing by copy a large set of data (2GB of photo).The result is no different. I do own Sandisk extreme SDHC card on my T3i and I do get 65MB/s of transfer rate. I strongly recommend consumers to test their premium (UHS-1) microSD. I felt very disappointed on Sandisk. I will try other brand like Samsung, Patriot or Lexar.",
"Moved all my 7.9 gigs of data from one SD card to this one and now I have plenty of room/storage on my phone.  I downloaded everything to my PC from my 8gig SD card, installed this one and then re-loaded my data to this 32gig SD card.  No complaints.",
This works just as advertised.  I have had no problems at all and works great in my new GoPro Silver edition.,
"I think that this product by itself is a great product.  However, not all devices is built for microSD XC.  And not all devices like pad and phone that specifically states that it features microSD with compatability to microSD XC.  This happened to me.  Since I just bought a new pad, I thought that it would be compatible.  However, it did not.  the microSD XC is formatted with exFAT so my device can detect the hardware but it can't write or read from it.",
My Galaxy s3 (and me) couldn't be happier- good price arrived quickly and what can I say - it does what its supposed to do!,
"This card is pretty cheap for how tiny (physically) and large (digitally) it is - at least in mid 2014. I got it to extend the storage capacity of my Surface Pro 3, and it has done just that. I can store files on it so that I don't have to take up precious space that can be dedicated towards programs since the Surface Pro 3 has a full Windows 8 on it. It also doubles as a storage device for my GoPro Hero 3 Black, but I have a faster card for it to prevent the freezing issue. The size of this micro SD card just does a great job in storing data like videos, photos, and music. It fits in most devices that are moving to Micro SDXC, such as phones, tablets, and my beloved Surface Pro 3. I highly recommend this card if you just need to extend the storage of your device. Reconsider a faster card if you want to record video straight to it, like with a GoPro.",
Good price on this big micro SD card. Works with my Samsung Galaxy S5 great.,
"This is a great speed card.More than 20 MB/sec. Works perfect on my Android device Samsung Galaxy SII (GT-I9100). Also works perfect using CyanongenMod 10.1.The only downside: the price. Is an expensive card.I use it for music playback, like PowerAmp, Spotify and Rdio. Works flawless.",
"Used this in an Android tablet.  It's fast, reliable and performs exactly as expected.",
I got this microSD card to use in my new Asus tablet.  It works great.  I also wanted it to use in my camera as its SD card.  Fitted into the SD card adapter and it works perfectly in the camera.  Pull it out and put it into the tablet slot and I can get my pictures off the card as well as use it for some other things.  Perfect.,
Love Alexa....it works so well. Speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many things it does!,
Put in camera and started taking picture without even formatting the disk.Although it only recognizes about 29 GBs .  ( makes me think why?)I think there may be some SanDisk Tools hidden on the disk.The bright coloring makes easy to find in the camera bag.,
"i love this micro sd.  It enables me to expand the storage space on my Acer W3.  Great price too,",
I got this for my Samsung Galaxy S3 when it was on sale. My fairly new internal card reader wasn't able to write to it so I tried 2 different USB adapters and they didn't work either. I installed it in my phone and was able to copy files via USB. It was slow but it worked and is great in the phone.,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"I bought this for the expandable memory in my Galaxy Note 2, and it works perfectly without any issues. It is plug and play, no format required, at least with Jellybean.",
Would not work in my Samsung Galaxt Tab 2 7.0 3G that I purchased it for.  But it does work fine in my Asus TF700. So I swapped the cards between them and everythings's OK.  First time I've seen this with a Sandisk product.,
"PROS.1.-Bigest memory in a microSD card (64 GB).2.-You have to FORMAT it with a modern device, if not you'll have only 32GB. If you format it with a modern device you'll have 60GB (the 64GB is impossible, or at leats I couldn't).3.-Even if your device says ""maximum microSd memory 32GB"", this memory 64 GB card can works. I tested on Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0, Galaxy SII and SIII, Galaxy Note II (phone), Galaxy Note 10.1 (Tablet) and on all Asus Transformer. It works fast and perfectly in all of them.CONS.1.- Just the price but you already have plenty of offers. I waited patiently and finally I bought it for $49.9 (incredible!)",
"Easy to install and performs per specs.  I have expanded the capacity of my handheld scanner with this product.  The convenience of these micro products is phenomenal!  I began my career in IT in the 70's and can attest to the truly wonderful progress tech has made over the years.  We do more with less--that's innovation, that's capitalism at its best!",
The SanDisk Ultras tend to work reliably on all my different cameras and phones which is not always true of some common but less expensive cards. This simplifies ordering but they do cost a bit more.,
I got this card to supplement the built in 32GB in my Galaxy Note 3.  This card provides superb internal xfer speed on the phone as well as to the PC using the Note 3's USB 3.0 port.,
"Works. There's nothing else to say so yes it works, and yes it works. It also works, so it is pretty good.",
"I use this card in my 7&#34; iGo GPS. The GPS came with a couple of GB onboard, but that was quickly used up by WinCE 6 and that GPS software. Since this device also plays MP3s, I wanted more space.I read the meager documentation that came with the device to see if it could handle a 16GB card. I was pretty sure it would handle an 8GB card, but one never knows with these ever-changing specifications. Unfortunately, the documentation for this device was meager and written in pidgin English.OK, I'll buy it and give it a try. At worst, I swap out my 8GB card from a different device, which hopefully will handle the 16GB card.Well, too make a long story short (too late for that, eh?), the 16GB card works just fine. I put a bunch of my MP3s on the card, put it into the device, and sure enough, it recognizes and plays them.So, pretty much a done deal. For the price, for the ease of use, for the name brand, I recommend this little card.",
"Sandisk announcement of the first 128GB micro SD took internet by storm. Our phones evolved into multimedia powerhouses with 5.5&#34;-6&#34; displays, desktop grade processing power, OTG support for external peripheral accessories, powerful cameras, and more. The only thing was missing a super high capacity internal removable storage at an affordable price. 128GB micro SD announcement finally filled that gap, supported by amazon current sale of $119 shipped, but the question still remained if some of the older smartphones will be able to handle/recognize this capacity. I was personally curious considering original Note 2 spec was calling for support of up to 64GB only.Now, about the card itself. Its their Ultra edition with a read speeds of up 30MB/s and Class 10 performance. As part of Ultra edition it's considered to be waterproof, temperature-proof, x-ray-proof, magnet-proof, and also shockproof. In addition to a flash card itself, it also includes SD adapter for compatibility with digital cameras and also direct reading on laptops/PCs support SD card.So here comes the verdict: IT WORKS with Note 2!!! My Note 2 is all stock, Verizon SCH-I605 version, running stock Android 4.3. I checked the card first with an adapter on my laptop and then mounted it on my Note 2 where it was recognized with a right capacity. I also ran A1 SD Benchmark app (both long and accurate benchmark tests) to verify it with success. Read/write speed were not quite near 30MB/s, but it's still pretty good.My opinion? This card takes multimedia powerhouse Note 2 to the next level!!! Now you don't have to be limited and can store your favorite albums in FLAC audio format, or have a small library of your favorite movies stored permanently, or take more high def videos, and so on. Just always stay up to date with backups. If flash card fails, it will be covered under warranty, but your pictures and videos will be lost forever.",
"Last Christmas I gave my nephew a fire stick, which he loved. In the meantime, I purchased an Amazon Tap for myself. Since he likes gadgets, I knew he would want one. So I purchased it for him",
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
This worked really well for me. I used it in a GoPro camera for recording a couple of hours of video. Love the storage space.,
Bought this for my girlfriend.The card works very nice and is a great way to up your storage on your cell phone.this is currently in a Samsung Galaxy S4.,
THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT AND WAS A REASONABLE ENOUGH PRICE. I AM GOING TO BUY A LARGER ONE NEXT TIME. BEST CHK OUT THE SIZE YOU CAN USE IN YOUR PRODUCT BEFORE BUYING.,
"I used this Memory Card to Expand the Memory in my Smartphone. It worked as expected and was easy to setup. I copied the Stuff from my older MicroSD Card to my computer, changed cards, gave it a couple of minutes to Initialize, and copied the stuff back... Worked great.",
Got this for my Galaxy Note. I didn't want pay triple the price in the ATT store so I bought here instead.,
"Echo Dot in my GMC Sierra Denali. At first she was just there with no support. She sat in that hole with no protection. Shifting, jiggling not knowing what can happen. There has to be something I can do. I looked and search and what I found is the Fabric Case for Alexa. This is it! A support she will be happy to wear. No more accidental popping out, no more shifting and readjusting, she is finally safe.",
Purchased this to expand the memory of my unit and it is operating just the way I needed it to work.,
I would highly recommend them to everyone. Got it when I was told that I would get it. Very happy.,
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
"If you already have the Amazon Echo system then the Tap is a nice addition. I use it primarily as an outdoor speaker for my patio when the weather is nice. There are Bluetooth speakers on the market with better sound quality but it does an adequate job as a speaker. The real advantage is being able to interface with the Echo system as well as item to music, news,etc. I have not used it off it's charger long enough to comment on battery life but so far a six hour session outside was no problem.",
"My review is a little backwards&#8230; but I thought the most relevant should go first.WARNING: ONLY BUY THIS CARD ON SALE!The *typical* price since summer 2013 is about $24 for 32 GB, and about $48 for 64 GB.  DO NOT pay any more than this, and you can actually pay less if you have the luxury of time / patience.The lowest (non-lightning) price hit about $18.00 for 32GB and $35 for 64GB, in early December.  I basically buy when the price hits $20 or less, and the 64 nears $40.00.From December 2013 to January 2014, I watched these cards change price on an almost daily basis.  They initially went on sale for about $17.95 and $34.95 for 32 and 64 respectively.  I watched them slowly increase in price, with random dips and peaks for a month.  On January 6th 2014, they still show as a &#34;Best Deal on Amazon&#34; for &#34;7 more days&#34; but they are at the highest price point since last summer -- and higher than I have *ever* payed for these cards!  So don't let the &#34;Best Deals&#34; section deceive you, at $27/$50, these are NOT a &#34;deal&#34; in terms of price.Okay, here's my actual &#34;review&#34; of these absolutely great SDXC cards.****I have tried a variety of MicroSDXC cards, and so far the Samsung Ultra UHS1 are the best -- and the price can't be beat -- for all the most important reasons: speed, capacity, reliability, durability.I have not had a single failure, and I use these cards in my Nook HD+, Nexus 7 2013 (via USB) and my Canon 5D Mark II (with converter) and MacBook Pro (In the card slot).  They're durable and waterproof, and  I can use the same card in all these devices without reformatting.  I even had one go through the wash, and I still use it for pictures.For the technically inclined, I have cards with *both* the Clockwork Mod bootloader (for the Nook HD+) and the MagicLantern firmware for my Canon EOS 5D II on the same card.  I can pull it from the Nook, shoot pictures with the camera, and look at the results on the Nook by just pulling the card out of one device and placing it in the other.  This should be possible with any SDXC/SDHC card, but it turns out that the Samsung UHS1 is the only card I've found that works reliably.  Some cards won't boot because they're too slow too finicky, but all my Samsung UHS1s work great (the 64GB will not boot in the Nook, but no 64GB card will).I keep my eyes open for price drops on these cards because they've performed so well for me.  Samsung also has a newer, faster card, but its price-point hovers somewhere north of &#34;prohibitive&#34; so I still stick with these.  And that's good news regardless because as the new card increases its market share, these should drop even further in price.",
It works in my Note 2 smart phone. I don't think there is much else you can say about it.,
"Known brand, good packaging and working well in the phone.I wish the reviews did not require a set number of words.",
"If you can get this sd card on special or discount, please grab it up!!  I currently have this in my Surface RT and this has become an instant (fast) 64g of storage.  SanDisk makes very reliable products.  I would highly recommend.",
As soon as this card arrived I tested some clips I recorded in full HD video (1920 x 1080p x 30FPS) from my Canon T3i.  The card performed flawlessly.I purchased this to expand my Surface Pro's available memory and I am very pleased.,
Used in Samsung Galaxy S III phone. Formatted in the phone. Has worked perfectly so far. A very economical storage card. Faster than previous cards I have owned.,
"Great device it's zippy, has an AWESOME display, great sound for a tablet (rivals/bests any portable device I currently own, including laptops) has incredible ease of use and I'm basically all-in on the Amazon ecosystem. I know people lament the loss of Google Play, but I'm a simple guy who doesn't actually need absolutely everything. I can watch movies/videos from the major streaming services I use (Netflix/Prime), music (Pandora, Spotify, Prime), the various apps I use for fantasy sports, reading emails, ebooks (honestly the main reason I bought this thing), and reddit. That's more or less all I need it to do, and it does all of these things beautifully and quickly.The reason for the 3 star is because, as of this review, the device has the SUPREMELY ANNOYING HABIT OF LOCKING UP. It seems to happen most often when I'm running a music program while reading or browsing then attempting to shutting it off. It occurs to me anywhere from once to three times a day, but this is a device that I only use when I'm traveling around or somewhere away from my home computer, so those 1-3 times happen at the most inconvenient opportunities.Example of a recent situation: I'm waiting for my class to start so I'm hanging out at the college library, listening to some stuff on Prime while flipping through reddit, with headphones on. It's time to go in, so I switch to the music app to shut it off and simultaneously remove the headphones to put it in my bag. Except it locks up the screen stops moving, I lose any and all functions to use it, and the music just KEEPS ON PLAYING. I can't shut it off.Read more",
I gave this to my daughter for Christmas because she wanted a portable speaker. I thought the addition of Alexa would be fun. She loves it. She said the sound is really great.,

"It's an SD Card that works great.  Big storage, and writes fast enough for me.  Not much to complain about.",
"What can I say.  I got this at a one day sale only on Amazon and wow this things worked smoothly. No errors, no formatting needed. I just popped it into my GSIII and it worked like a charm",
"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.",
I purchased this version to expand memory on my 16gb android tablet.  Nothing fancy but it does the job.  No problems and it played back flawlessly all the files I transferred.There are so many different microSD cards out now but if you see this on sale then you might want to consider it instead of cheaper no-name brand.,
"I've been trying for a while to get a hold of a 32GB Micro SD for my phone and tablet.  It's pretty fast compared to the 16GB cards I've been using.  I really saw the performance boost with my phone, which I have many apps, pictures, music, and other documents on.  The phone boots fully stable in about 2 mins as apposed to 5-6 mins.  My computer also can write to these cards much faster than the 16GB ones I was using.  If you phone, tablet or any other device can support it I recommend you purchase these.  Also you pay like half the price using Amazon as opposed to other retail stores who's price is at least double or more.  I've seen these same cards going for about $72 in my area.",
I bought this to save music (MP3) and movies (MP4) for my ASUS MeMO Pad HD 7 and it works great.,
Perfect for my SS Galaxy Note and a great price too!  I recommend this SD card for all your storage needs.,
"It functions...it's a memory card, not sure what else to post. It works great and I haven't had any issues. Great price too.",
"These are such great tiny things and hold so much on my tablet and smartphone.  Love them so much, I just got a 32 GB one.",
Did not do any tests but it works great in my Galaxy Note 2.  So far nothing wrong to report.  Recommended.,

"32 GB SD Card works well, and the price was reasonable, very happy with purchase so far! Worth a try!",
"Could not figure out why this card crashed multiple times in my Samsung Galaxy SIII, and demanded a reformatting. Then after 5hrs of calls to Sprint & Samsung I got a guy who reads factory stuff!Samsung Galaxy SIII is a Class 4 & Class 6 supported Motherboard, with Qualcomm processor. The Sprint stores only sell Class 4 memory, and there is a reason that Camera memory~Class 10 is not sold there, the board, just like in a PC, has to support the data stream. It does not!If you have an Android Phone you better make sure the motherboard supports it! Even Samsung's USA website does not tell you the board supported memory! They won't, and don't tell who the board manufacturer is in this Galaxy SIII phone. I asked at the Texas Samsung advanced tech support center after 1hr on hold, and they had no specs to even share. They don't get it!PASS IF YOU HAVE A CELL PHONE, UNLESS YOU GET IT IN WRITING FROM THE MOTHERBOARD MANUFACTURER OF YOUR PHONE. I went through this same stuff building custom PC's with Intel motherboards. Memory has to be built to run on this board, at this speed, with this processor, or it will not work properly, and will crash, and lose data.",
Works perfectly on my GoPro camera Silver Edition HD 3+. Been in use for about three months with no problems. Highly recommend.,
"If you're reading reviews of the new 3rd generation Paperwhite, you're likely considering buying one. If so, you're probably in one of these categories:* Never owned a Kindle e-ink reader* Own an older Kindle e-ink reader, but not a Paperwhite* Own a first or second generation PaperwhiteI'll save my opinion on whether the new Paperwhite 3 is worth buying until the end of my review. (But I will say this: They've taken a great product and made it even better.) First, here's a comparison of the new Paperwhite with the second generation Paperwhite (comparisons are for the wi-fi models):Second Generation Paperwhite (2013)-------------------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.3 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 212 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: TouchscreenNumber of fonts: 6Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lightingAll-New Paperwhite (2015)------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.2 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: TouchscreenNumber of fonts: 7Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lightingNote that the physical size is identical to the older Paperwhite, so covers and sleeves that worked with the older Paperwhites are still usable (thank you, Amazon). The most obvious difference is the screen resolution: 300 pixels per inch is a major jump from the 212 pixels per inch in the older Paperwhites.Read more",
Love the fact that it has a rechargeable battery and can be moved with no issues for listening in other rooms. Has a decent amount of Bass for the size.,
"The Amazon Echo Tap is a nice & interesting device...but it did not fit my needs. I also have the Amazon Echo and absolutely love it. So what's the difference? A. You have to walk up the the Tap to touch it - this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the Echo from across the room. B. The audio quality not very good - more like a small bluetooth speaker. C. The Tap is fine around the house when it's connected to the home wi-fi, but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other wi-fi?? That is not going to work very well.",
Bought this and have tested in my Canon SX260. Videos record quick and replay without any loss.Placed in my Samsung Galaxy Tab and works great!Nothing bad to report about this SDHC module.,
This chip is holding all my music and photos so they are ready to share with friends and family on my tablet. Quick response and no drop outs or lags.  Price was amazing!!,
"I use this in my Samsung Galaxy Note II. For the money, it's a fantastic value. I haven't noticed any transfer speed issues, and it's been rock-solid reliable for the 3 months I've owned it. I have about 32GB of music stored on it, and every app that can use SD card storage is set to do so, including all my system backups. The ultimate &#34;install and forget&#34; add-on for your phone!",
Received it as promised. Inserted it into tables and was acknowledged that it is there.Guess it will work as expected also.,
Fast and very easy to use.  Works with my GS4 and it is comparable with other devices.  Want to buy the 64 GB one.,
"Sling is simply awesome and so is the Amazon Tap!! My tap arrived this morning along with this sling and I am currently testing both products out as we speak!! This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.) I love the bright and vibrant colors6.) Silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging7.) Doesn't adversely affect sound qualityOverall: I do feel 20 for the sling is a little high but for the protection it provides my brand new tap, I very happy with it.. I didn't buy my tap to sit still at home..Read more",
Does as advertise. Good for bedroom and you can plug in external speakers.,
"Bought this memory card as a spare for my Samsung Tab 2 10.1.  It works great, and allows me to bring extra movies, songs, and audiobooks with me to play on the tablet when I travel on vacations.",
...and they're right!This microSDHC card is fast. I started formatting it a little behind another class 10 card (not a UHS-1) card and it formatted all 32GB ahead of the Transcend 16GB card - which is no slouch either! It's the fastest flash card I've sent yet. I doubt you will be disappointed unless you're an alien with more advanced technology.,
Works well. No problems after using it for a number of months. I've always found the SanDisk memory cards to be reliable.,
"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",
It's really hard to write alot about a memory card.  This one is great and works as promised. The capacity is why I purchased it so I can have all my files and music on my windows phone.,
"I placed his SanDisk 64GB Micro SDXC card in my Galaxy S5 phone.  My phone &#34;sees&#34; the card and tells me that the card has 64GB of space available.  So far, so good! - I'll update this review if the card stops working!",
"I originally bought this for my digital SLR and it works the way it is supposed to. Since I didn't need capacity for over 7,000 pictures I put this in my Samsung tablet and got a 32 gb for the camera. If you need or just want 64 gb of memory this is the one to buy.",
"...to have both the micro and the adapter in the same package. I only had to buy ONE package to get the items I needed for my Smartphone and my digicam.  I replaced the 2 gig micro in my phone with the 32 gig one, then reformatted my 2 gig micro to be used in the adapter for my camera, then uploaded photos to my laptop using the adapter.I would have given it 5 stars, but the adapter stopped working after only 2 months! Truthfully, though, I don't know if it's because the product is defective, or if I just handled it too much or incorrectly. So I feel 4 stars is fair.",
"Always good, what else can I say ?",
I have used to record video while riding my quad. Usually the battery in my camera dies before I run out of space in this memory card.,
"I bough it because it said it was fast, but not. I'm only getting 13Mb/s with an Galaxy Note II a very fast an excellent phone.",
I have a number of SanDisk memory products and they have been 100% reliable. This microSD is no exception. I purchased this memory specifically because it was the largest microSD memory currently available. i am using it for removable data storage on a Windows SurfacePro2 to free on-board SSD drive memory. Reviews of the SurfacePro2 didn't verify compatibility of the 128GB microSD but the SurfacePro2 immediately recognized it and it operates flawlessly.,
"Fast card while it worked.  Died less than a week after return period expired....  Must note though that that is the nature of any memory storage card or drive.  Some fail, some last forever.  Not SanDisk's fault, not amazons fault - it is what it is.  BUT it is for this reason that i think Amazon should extend the return period on items which fall into this category.  Dont worry amazon, i still love you - but feel like your played the role of a proctologist on this one...",
"Some people complain about SD cards:1) Not working fast enough2) Some android devices are acting slow3) Rooted phones do not boot from SD cards.This card is fast about 28 MB/s, removed all the lag from Android device. HDR video recorder have no delays between video recordings (Which usually happens with most of the cards on the market) and all android rooted phones I tried booted and worked.I really recommend this card for price and performance!Good luck and enjoy you purchase.",
"I searched for an inexpensive 64 GB micoSDXC card for my new Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition (32GB) tablet and this one caught my eyes regarding positive comments and price. The Note was a Christmas gift and it will be used for media entertainment while on business travel and as a replacement for an aging Toshiba Notebook. There were no problems with the install ... the card was recognized upon boot-up after the installation. I don't require great transfer speeds for my tasks. A quick test using ES File Explorer copying a 400 MB media file from the tablet OS card to this expansion card yielded 10 MB/s write and 40+ MB/s read speed, which is more than sufficient for all my tasks. As a bonus, I added this card to my shopping cart at $46.99 and the following day the price dropped to $37.99. That was all the incentive needed to push the &#34;Place your Order&#34; button. I can't speak much of reliability since I've had the card installed for less than two weeks. So far it has been stable.",
The card seems fast and it's a huge amount of storage for the price. It has worked flawlessly for a few months in a range of smartphones and cameras.,
So far it is working fine with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0. Access to videos and music on the card is very fast.,
I purchased this for my Motorola Xoom and it works great. I also use it with my Cannon T2i camera and it is the only card that doesn't lock up or give me a busy while videoing HD. I am very happy with it,
"I bought this for my son's tablet for cartoon videos, movies and &#34;all&#34; games he will be downloading (He's under 5 yrs so they'll be small simple games).",
Bought this item to use in my Android based tablet and it has worked just fine.  Doubled my storage capacity at a very reasonable cost.,
"This a great card with lots of storage for the money. Don't hesitate in buying this, it's a steal for the amount of storage you get.",
Put it in a family members android phone and have had zero issues...exactly what you would expect from this type of product,
I have an Amazon Echo and an Amazon Dot. Love the functionality. Decent sound for what they are. I just wanted something portable for outside.,
We are HUGE fans of the Amazon Fire Stick and my son realllly wants to play the games with the remote. A little pricey in my opinion. Works great though and I know I can return if it breaks!,
Amazing Sound! All around great product! Nothing negative so far.,
"Back when I purchased my Samsung Galaxy S4, the deciding factor between it and the iPhone was the capability of SD card storage, so when the chance came to grab a 32GB card for 20 dollars, I jumped on it. It performs flawlessly, and comes with a standard sized SD card so you can fit the micro into it and access it from your computer.Folks, if you purchase an Android phone with SD card capabilities, don't go for the 32GB phone and pay up to a hundred dollars more. Just grab a micro SD card for less, and thank me in the morning!",
"I haven't had any problems with this card.  I use it with my Galaxy S3.  The transfer speeds have been quite fast and I didn't have to format the card.  Between this card and my Dropbox, I don't ever foresee me running out of space.",
"Fortunately I got this as a lightning deal, so it wasn't that expensive.  I purchased it in October, but didn't start using it on my Samsung Galaxy S3 until January.  It was fine, until it wasn't.  It chose to die today.  Just a little more than four months after I started using it.  I checked my phone this morning and it told me that the SD card had been unmounted.  I did not think much of it.  But when I rebooted my phone and was still unable to find the card, I began to be concerned.  When I got home from work, I put a different card in, and it worked fine.  I tried to check the card on my computer, and it couldn't be seen.  So the problem is definitely a card.  Unfortunately, I lost most of the pictures I've taken since getting this phone.  I know that I probably should have backed them up, but I really didn't expect the card to fail so quickly.  Perhaps if I'd read all of the one start posts before buying, I would have.  Oh well, back to my 16GB Amazon Class 10 card until I can get a different one.I'm not even going to bother with a warranty claim.  I don't need another card that will fail after four months.",
"Not much you can say about a memory card. It works or it doesn't.Popped this puppy into the phone, was instantly recognized and is functioning perfectly. Very good price.",
"I purchase three of these and they work great, and were almost half the local price. If you need a reliable high speed micro sd card, this is for you.",
Got a Samsung Galaxy note 2 7.0 I'm gonna use for a CarPC and found that you could install a 64gb microSD. Tried this one and it worked flawlessly. Pretty zippy too for a tablet (ugh....tablets read/write is stupid slow but just good enough for media I suppose)Plugged this thing right in and used the tablet to format it. Got 60gb out of it. Good good.,
"YOu can't go wrong on this card.  For my ROKU 2 XS, this is the perfect size.  Probably over-kill actually.  But i won't do anything under Class 10 and i try to avoid anything under 16 gigs in case i need this card for something else. Price was great too, under $15 with free shipping.",
"hello,we have been using sandisk memory cards since the beginning of sd cards.  this latest version was recommended for my samsung galaxy 4s phone.  with the zillion photos, videos and apps, the original 16/13gb of space was becoming full and not saving due to ""lack of space.""  so, the sandisk micro sd card was the answer.  pop the back off easily on the phone, slip the mini sd card into the provided slot, make sure it ""clicks"" in and put the phone cover back on the unit.  it is as simple as that.  now, i have 32 gb of extra space and my new phone stores anything i want to store.  (i constantly make backups to my home computer...very easy)  the connection simply shows the phone data and the sd card data when connected to the home computer.  i transferred my largest photo/video file to the sd card.  now the original 12gb is open for more instant quality photos and videos.  when the original card gets loaded again.  13meg camera takes super quality photos and videos, but also takes up a lot of space.adding a micro sd card is less expensive than ordering a 32gb galaxy4s, but yrmv  great productupdate...  the original ""super large"" file that is on the sd card still shows up on the original gallery screen.  it still has the same functions, but my original 16gb shows more room for the next zillion photos, etc.",
I have been using this in my Canon camera. it has been working well. over 6000 photos and many videos.,
"Purchased two of these to use in my surface pro.  loaded one with 60 gigs of movies and one with 60 gigs of music.  Small form factor means easy to transport.Both work flawlessly in my Surface Pro.Redirected my itunes music to the d: drive and therefore using none of my Pro storage space for movies or music.Plays movies and music perfect to my Pro device.....no waits....no slow downs.....just pure streaming from the sandisk to my screen........ happy........Of course I have skydive, iCloud, and amazon cloud but sometimes you are away from fast wifi or just simply do not want to use any of your processing speed to stream....this enables me to have content available at a whim.",
"I purchased this for a cheap Android tablet.  I figured I'd try a cheap tablet first, and if I decided I wanted to go with an Android tablet, I'd get something good later.  But either way, the memory card will be used in one item or another, so I wanted to get a good one.  Like any other SanDisk product I've purchased, this card is top-notch.  Comes with the (in my opinion, necessary) SD card adapter.  Class 10 speed really makes a difference when you have the card filled with music/movies/apps.",
"I only buy SanDisk and this item like all the others I have purchased, worked perfectly the first time.  Love it!",
"Trs heureux que les livres soient sur Icloud. Aprs m'tre fait voler, c'est bien de pouvoir retrouver tous mes livres avec toutes les notes que j'avais prises.",
Samsung 32Gb I bought on EBay failed. This works great. Never buy from China Gadgets on EBay. The cards are phony and burn up.,
"I initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing: the paperwhite is great, but if you have spending money, go for the voyage.Fortunately, I had friends who owned each, so I ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis: both models now have 300 ppi, so the 80 dollar jump turns out pricey the voyage's page press isn't always sensitive, and if you are fine with a specific setting, you don't need auto light adjustment).It's been a week and I am loving my paperwhite, no regrets! The touch screen is receptive and easy to use, and I keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day. (In any case, it's not hard to change the setting either, as you'll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day, not every now and then while reading).Also glad that I went for the international shipping option with Amazon. Extra expense, but delivery was on time, with tracking, and I didnt need to worry about customs, which I may have if I used a third party shipping service.",
See above.  Nice to have the extra room in my Blackberry Z30.  LOTS of content goes with me.  Packaging was adequate but not over-the-top.,
There's a lot of features and we are just getting started with Tap. Glad we made the purchase!,
Yeah baby. Love getting this amount of memory for so cheap. I'm not a pro but for everyday use it's a great deal.,
"Used on a Galaxy Note and so far it has been great, fast card and excelent brand, a+ performance !Update may 10 2013, it stopped working! It does not work with my Galaxy Note or my PC, sadly it is not recognized by any device...",
A fantastic discount and remarkable value for a name brand product that would cost three times the amount that I paid,
"I bought this extra memory for my Samsung Galaxy S4.  I wish I had known when I bought my phone that Android changed its memory management technique between Gingerbread and Jelly Bean!  Verizon sold me a 16GB Samsung S4.  I didn't do much research since my old phone broke and I was about to leave on a business trip the next day.  Come to find out, there are 32 and 64GB versions of the Galaxy S4!  I never asked Verizon if they even carried different versions.  Well, I figured that wouldn't be a problem... I'll just put in a 64GB Micro SD (TF) Card and I'll be all set.  Unfortunately you can no longer transfer Apps to the Micro SD Card.  Some apps can store data on the SD Card but there is no longer the ability to ""Move to SD.""  Since I travel internationally, I use a lot of GPS mapping software and would like to download multiple Gigs of map data for offline mapping.  As of now, I can only download this to my phone's 16GB memory, and not to this 64GB memory card!  Pictures (except for burst photos), videos and music can all be put on the 64GB SD card.  All that being said, this memory card works well, and is priced on par with all of the other comparable cards on the market.  If you've got the cash and need the space (for music, videos/movies and/or pictures--just not apps) then I recommend picking one of these up.",
"I was really looking forward to using what was hyped as an amazing piece of entertainment equipment, but the actual experience falls short.Pros:+ User interface and underlying hardware is fast+ Form factor of the device and remote control is very sleek+ Plays games fairly well, especially for such a small box+ Quality of Amazon videos is very good+ Voice search works quite well+ The device came pre-configured for my Amazon account. I just plugged it in, updated the software, and away I wentCons:- First and foremost, there is STILL no way to search for only free movies on Prime.- Amazon touts it's 40,000 Prime movies available, but good luck finding them. There is no categorization by genre. You are stuck surfing through dumb lists of movies, or using the search function, which almost never returns any Prime movies- Voice search works only on Amazon content. You cannot use this to search within Netflix, for example- The Amazon FireTV box only comes with 8GB of memory for game and app storage, which is completely inadequate. There are games available for download that consume almost 2GB for ONE GAME. Good luck downloading a 1.76GB game, like the racing game featured in the list of top games.Clearly, Amazon is marketing this device as a way to push its video content. In the help video that automatically plays the first time you use the device, it even offers you a 30 day Prime membership for free to try it out. However, Amazon has no incentive to help you actually search for and find this free content. It's clearly evident in the lack of ability to filter search results on free Prime content only. This is my biggest beef with Amazon, by far. I want a Netflix-like experience, where my Prime content is sorted by genre, and I can search for free movies only. Now, if you want to pay for video rentals, by all means buy this device, because it works really well. If you want it to access your Prime content only, stick to the Roku box you probably already have, because it works just as good.UPDATE:I called customer service, and talked to a guy about how I can search for and access my 40,000 Prime movies. Well....YOU CAN'T According to him, I can only find the Prime movies on the two lists on FireTV that say Recently added to Prime and Top Prime Movies. Those lists are 73 items, and 150 items, respectively. THERE IS NO WAY TO SEARCH OR BROWSE FREE PRIME CONTENT ONLY. The guy I talked to said this was a very common request for people. OF COURSE IT IS. I don't want to pay for video rentals if I just paid for a Prime membership to access free content. AMAZON COMPLETELY FAILED. I AM RETURNING THE FIRE TV.",
"If you're using this on a device that records video and photos, this is highly recommended. The class 10 classification means this thing will keep up with what you're recording without skipping a beat. This is perfect for devices such as the GoPro cameras.",
This memory card worked well in my Samsung S3 and was instantly recognized.  I didn't have to do a single thing aside from installing it.,
"I bought this for media storage on my Surface 2 and absolutely love it. It allows me to store my videos, pictures, and music on a removable drive and keep my tablets memory free for apps.

Went to several online forums to see what the solution is; then someone hit upon it, it just might be a problem with this brand of cards.I bought a PNY brand micro SD card and had no problem whatsoever.",
"It isn't as fast as the class10 I used before, and the file structure only allows 29.7G free to put data on.  I can see SOME loss, but I'm very displeased with losing over 2G of space!  That's a big waste percentage.",
"I personally got mine to expand my Surface storage and it works brilliantly, it holds all of my media: movies, tv, books, and pictures; with plenty of room to spare.",

Got it for my Note 10.1 and it's great being able to pop it into my computer via the adapter to load large amounts of pictures on and then back into my tablet. Kinda wishing I got a larger capacity one.,
"I needed some extra storage for my Galaxy Note 10.1. This works perfectly in my tablet and at this time, I have yet to fill it. Copying the files I want to this have been fast and reliable. I would suggest this to anyone needing extra space.",
Sandisk is far away the best memory card ever.I used to this brand because it never fails.The future of this kind is eternal.,
Extremely easy install for Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.  Gives me fast easy storage for movies and games.  Everything you could want from a micro SD.,
Scan Disk 64 Gig for under $40 there was nothing to decide.  I spent the money and was glad i did.,
I bought this card specifically to run CyanogenMod 10 to my old nook Nook Color to breathe some life back into the device that I never use anymore. This card works great to run CM10 with the Nook thanks to its speed. A quick overclock of the processor via CM10 and the tablet is dare I say &#34;peppy&#34;. I highly recommend this card for any application where speed is crucial.,
"It is so painful when you just buy that new gadget and a new and better one comes along, bummer. But this great  little card helps you keep the envy at bay becuase while they might have the fastest, you can wow them with content: A huge library of Movies, songs and apps right at your fingertips becuase you have this baby in  your phone, buy one as insurance from phone and tablet envy.EnjoyPS format it in your device, this will ensure compatability, in most cases.Update: 4 months later: Still doing its job. Lots of space for apps, music and movies and still happy with my device. No problems or troubles to report. Good product.Enjoy.Jb",
"Have several of these for my video devices and they work great, Sandisk is a great product and have never had one fail in over 6 years. Great price too.",
"lots of room on here for movies, video, if you need the space, this is it, and they offer more GB too",
"Works just as it should in my Lumia 810; no issues at all. The phone is not a particularly speed sensitive application for the card so I cannot comment on how well it works under stress. The phone doesn't complain, music plays nicely from the card, pictures are written to it without delays. The red and gray design looks different and interesting, even though no one will see it.",
"Great addition to my phone, came with SD card converter so I was able to transfer data from my old card using my laptop. Have had no issues and I love all the extra space available for photos and videos.",
It's an SD card.  No one has the tools to test whether this is a Class 10 with speeds of blah blah blah.  It works and that is all that matters.,
Works great with excellent speeds formatted as FAT32 with a new Samsung Galaxy Note 2! This memory let's me load most larger game apps (with GL to SD) and media files off the main internal memory. Very fast!,
Bought this as a replacement for another 64gb micro sd card I had for about two years before it died on me a few days ago. No issues with this as of yet. Loaded up just fine read and write speeds seem fine as I was able to transfer over 27gbs of data in a few minutes. Using it in a Note 3 with no issues.,
"I had low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. But, keep in mind that this is not an iPad or typical Android tablet. This is an Amazon media and shopping machine. It is well built, has good battery life, reasonably fast and responsive, dual band wifi, SD card slot, decent display and so-so camera. No tablet is going to give you awesome sound, but I was surprised at how well the two speakers sound on this tablet. No tablet it going to give you a great camera, and this tablet is probably on the lower end of the spectrum - it works, but it won't be your go-to camera for important shots. This tablet excels at playing Amazon content - music and video. It is a great reader, although a little heavy compared to a Kindle device. It makes shopping easy - perhaps too easy. The OS is based on Android, but don't look for Google Play or Google apps in general - this is nothing like an Android tablet. Finally, you can't beat the price. I think Amazon wants to get these in the hands of as many people as possible. I would have given this 4.5 stars if that option was available. I didn't give it 5 stars only because it is not a general purpose tablet. This is a dramatic improvement over the Fire 7. The integration of Alexa is flawless and works very well - depends on whether or not you have an Echo and on how you feel about that product. I have an Echo and find it useful (not essential but useful). I find myself using Alexia on this tablet more than I thought I would.",
"I am a huge fan of the echo. That being said this is the last one I would buy. The original echo's speaker sounds much better and is hands free. The dot has great connection Bluetooth and more importantly audio out to plug into a stereo system. I bought this for the purpose of being able to carry outside around the house when working in the yard. The sound is not as robust as the original echo (not portable - no internal battery), but good enough when in the yard to at least have music.",
I have an Amazon Echo and the Amazon Tap works wonderfully with Echo. The sound quality is great. It is easy to use and set up. It beats turning on the receiver for music. If you are looking for great and easy sound machine the Tap is it.,
"This SD card USED to be one of the fastest. Now it is merely adequate.I bought the 64GB version and inserted into my Samsung Galaxy S5 (latest Samsung phone).The performance, although still adequate, is less than stellar. For example, to load the Amazon Kindle app, which is about 35mb and I purposely placed it into this SD card, it takes about 7 full seconds to load. The same app on my iPad takes around 2 seconds to load.Still, if you aren't too much into your smartdevice performance, then I wouldn't worry. But if you do care about how fast your smartphone can take pictures (assuming your pictures are stored in SD cards) or how fast your apps will load, then you should purchase a much faster SD card for your latest phone.Pros:1)Adequate performance.2)Hassle free packaging.Cons:1)Not the fastest, but still adequate.",
"I( read the reviews and even listened to this in store. But much to my chagrin, at high volume, this will not cut it. The portability is great!",
"Good case, it is nice that it comes with an SD adapter, fast transfer of pictures, over all good memory card.",
Anybody getting this 64 GB card be aware that this card before use  needs to be formatted. The problem is that computers only format 32 GB or less ( I got only 28 GB formatted)  of the card. SanDisk don't tell that to nobody. So what's the use to buy such expensive card when you can only use 32 GB instead of the 64. You can Google it and discover that other people had the same problem. I wish i knew.I bought it to put it on my Galaxy Note 2 android phone. I think they shouldn't even sell the 64 GB or at least informed the people. I heard that there are applications that could make it work but when i buy something I expect that to work without the need of hassling around since i'm not a geek.,

We're excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound, and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD. As you correctly point out, the new Kindle Fire HD is the successor to last year's entry level Kindle Fire, which does not include features such as camera, microphone, or HDMI port.

"Item arrived in time as promised. Works well with a galaxy note 10.1. There is nothing more to say about this product as it has been reviewed so many times. It works well, not a bad price at the time of ordering ( now it has come down ). Yes, you get the same card for lesser price from other sellers but I trust amazon for their customer service issues. I prefer to pay 2 bucks more and get it from amazon rather than getting it from unfamiliar sellers.",
"I bought a pair of these during Amazon's cyber Monday sale ($38.98 ea!).  One is working great in my Galaxy S3 (synched around 40 songs/minute using MediaMonkey in MTP mode) and the other I was going to use with the SD adapter as a backup for my DSLR, but after doing a long 1080p video test with no issues, I made it my primary card and sent my old 32gb SDHC to the bottom of the camera bag.",
"I will keep it short and sweet for potential buyers looking for facts and not b.s.I own two of the 32gb size of these cards for about 3 months now. They do work fairly well with cell phones and tablets, yet not so good with cameras, in fact these cards failed to work with my GoPro Hero3 camera and the customer service rep from Gopro claimed (and I happen to agree with him) that this card is not a true class 10 card let alone UHS-1.Benchmarks with my evo 4g with all allocation sizes the write speed never passed beyond 8mb/s while read speeds wondered around 25mb/s far below advertised speeds, well write speeds arent technically advertised (probably because they are of class 4 level)Benchmarks with crystal mark reported speeds even lower (due to adapter) with write speeds around 6mb/s while read speeds wondered around 20mb/s.Needless to say, if you are not worried about speeds and only about storage, these are perfect. If you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however, I suggest you not to loose your money on this, because even if your write speeds are around 10mb/s as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become useless.Again this review is based on GoPro camera and high definition raw recording.. For cell phones or for storage it works perfectly well with a bit of false advertisement..",
"What can I say? It's memory, the price was right and it's fast. My galaxy note 10.1 doesn't complain. Neither do I.",
"I got this for my Galaxy Note 3, as it accepts add on storage.  Works perfectly, and I use it to store all my music and files so I dont junk up the phones memory.",
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
fast quick does what it's suppose to do. I have placed this card in my GPro Hero 3 Black edition.,
I can always count on a good bargain on Amazon. Not only is the price good but their Prime program has saved me big time...,
I needed a micro SD card with more storage for my phone.  This was a good price for a lot of space.,
"I wanted to buy a Tap when it was first released. I have several Echo's in the house, but having a portable Alexa enabled device is awesome. Unfortunately, when it was first released, the tap could not be operated hands-free. I held off purchasing one because I was afraid Amazon would wait for new hardware to add that feature.Earlier this year Amazon enabled hands-free mode, and it works almost as well as the Echo, despite having fewer microphones.Sound quality is very good. It's a small speaker but very capable. Battery life is excellent. This is currently the most flexible implementation of Alexa and I recommend it.",
Bought this to go with my Samsung Galaxy S III. It is class 10 which means it is fast. Works well.,
"This tiny marvel does what it claims.  The only possible problem is that it is SO small that you may lose it if you happen to drop it during handling.  But with 16 GB capacity, you won't be handling it often.",
"wouldn't trade it for anything. i need the extra space, so it is very helpful. and sandisk always makes good stuff",
"trash quality, broke and corrupted my data on two different cards",
"As stated above, and not a bad price.  Bought this thing in hopes of using it with my Ztpad C93 tablet, and it works like a charm.  The card is very fast for what it is and I have not had any problems with it to date.",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"I bought it to use in mySony HDR-AS15 Action Video Camera (Black). It works great. The camera worked just fine with a class 4 card, but the offload speed was horrible. This speedy little card has eliminated that problem. Came with a SDHC adapter, which was a nice and unexpected bonus.",
"First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory. It would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage, go buy a computer.Display: One word, amazing. Maybe I am pushing it, but the screen is so clear. I own an iPhone 5 and my eyes prefer my kindle. I love reading on this machine and for the price, amazon did a good job with this one.Read more",
"SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s, super fast awesome memory card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2",
"I have loved and used my Kindle Keyboard for years now but I missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark. I purchased a Kindle Fire and I also use an iPad 3 but for ease of reading on my eyes I prefer the Kindle Keyboard. I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this new generation was released before I spent my money. I got this because I wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and I just love this new tablet. It offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text.I have added a video of the Kindle Paperwhite compared to a Kindle Keyboard and a Kindle Fire. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I will try to answer them.I love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear. I use the Kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books. Reading was my number one hobby my entire life and I just loved it. The Kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen I can enjoy my reading in every type of environment. I laid my Kindle Keyboard and the New Kindle Paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new Paperwhite. The new lighting system and screen clarity is where this Paperwhite design really is outstanding. With better contrast, lighting and custom designed fonts, the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e-Reader before. With 221 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) this screen provides a 768 by 1024 pixel screen that just makes the old Kindle Keyboard look old fashioned. Technology certainly does move quickly on.Read more",
"heard wonky reports on using a 64gig card in the S3, i have no experience or background in knowing that personally, so i did the safe thing and went with the 32 gig. I would like to get up to 64 but 5 star rating for this product.",
It works good with my phone.  Very fast when it is used.  Camera seems to work better.  Thanks for the deal.,
I was surprised as to how fast I recieved the Sandisk Micro SD I ordered. I ordered one before but it took almost 2 weeks. I recieved this one within 2 days. I plan to use this one for my next Android phone. I want to upgrade to a Samsung Galaxy model. I was instructed that most phones can handle up to 32gbs but found out that they can handle more.,
This MicroSDXC fits great in my Surface Pro tablet and provides all the storage I might need for now and can be replaced with another one if my business vs personal storage need grows too large but 64 GB is plenty of space. The Class 10 is also fast and smooth.,
"Bought the Tap for my mom to primarily listen to music. Although my mom forgets ""the girl's name"" haha, we've found Alexa will answer without saying her name. The rechargeable base is nice so the Tap can be moved around the house or outside within range of wifi. Sound is great, too! Pleased!",
"I put this in my Asus TF700T tablet. There were mixed reports of whether the tablet would support such a large card, as the official limit for this tablet is listed as 32 GB. I have had no problems with this in the TF700T, and leave it in the device all the time. This is a great way to ensure that you have a hefty amount of media available anywhere.",
Got this micro-data card for a digital camera that shoots in HD. it came with a class 4 card but the video clips were blocky. I had a class 6 and tested it in the camera with some improvement and at the advice of youtuber Techmoan (this guy does the best tech reviews on the web) I ordered this class 10 card. It solved the blocky issue and is a great value for the money.,
I bought this for my Galaxy S4.  You need to reformat it to Fat32 32kb cluster size to fully take advantage of it in the phone but once you do it works great.  I copied everything from my iPod (about 40GB) to it and now I can stop carrying 2 devices around.,
"I purchased a 64Gb Samsung SD card to expand the memory of the phone.However, I frequently get a message that the card has been removed or is recovering.Sometimes the problem clears itself, other times I have to reboot the phone.It also says ""MTP application will restart to prepare SD Card"". It then starts listing the restarting/recovering SD card.I eventually replaced it with a Sandisk 16gb microsd ""HD"" card from Walmart and it is operating fine.I have been reading a lot about people having issues with the 64gb sandisk cards and the Galaxy S4.I wish I had done more research before wasting $50 on what I thought was a good buy!",
This gizmo is awesome for those who want the portability and cool things you can do with the Alexa world!,
"For the price it was a great buy. I would recommend to all. It has a pretty high transfer rate, and comes with an adapter so you don't have to worry about that.",
"Sling is simply awesome and so is the Amazon Tap!! My tap arrived this morning along with this sling and I am currently testing both products out as we speak!! This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.) I love the bright and vibrant colors6.) Silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging7.) Doesn't adversely affect sound qualityOverall: I do feel 20 for the sling is a little high but for the protection it provides my brand new tap, I very happy with it.. I didn't buy my tap to sit still at home..Read more",

Used this for extending the capabilities of my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.  It greatly expands it use and was a snap to install and get started with it.,
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
"Just the right size for my knitting and crafting patterns, lets me take them anywhere I go and helps when buying yarn and fabric because all the info I need is on my Nook.",
I have had some problems with it. I bought to replace the original cover that was chewed by my dog. I have had to restart my Kindle to get it to hold a charge which helped but the charge does not last as long as it did with my original cover.,
"I have been using advanced technology for the last 20 years. It was born out of necessity not convenience. My wife passed away 4 years ago leaving me, not only a widow, but a widowed quadriplegic trying to survive on his own. We were married 20 years and yes she married me when I was already paralyzed. She was a beautiful lady here on earth and I am sure she is just as beautiful in God's presence. I have to attest that it has been an arduous journey. But one thing that has made it possible for me to live on my own even though I am paralyzed from the chest down, is smart technology. For example, I am able to run my entire home with apps on my phone, computer or tablet. I have lights, electric door locks, electric bed, air-conditioning/heat, cameras, both indoor and out side. Smart technology allows me to input data on my laptop when I am laying in bed I cannot use my arms when I am laying flat in bed because of the paralysis. Up to this point, I have used input through joysticks that operate by using my mouth. They work effectively but the joysticks must be placed specifically in front of my mouth and they have to remain there all night long. Smart technology allows me to be able to live safely on my own and has even allowed me to help take care of my 75-year-old mother whose health is, due to God's grace and technology, now stable and she is actually helping me more each day. Alexa has been a blessing beyond my imagination. She has given me an opportunity that I never thought would be possible. I still use the joystick input because they are reliable and not subject to Wi-Fi disruption but Alexis is growing more dependable each day. At this point I have only an echo Dot, but I am ordering, when funds allow, the regular echo and another Dot as well.Read more",

"I wasn't absolutely certain if this would work in my Samsung Galaxy SIII (an SGH-I747M) from a regional carrier here in Alaska.I read several reviews, but took a chance the 64GB card would work in my device and was pleased when it arrived.Opting for the &#34;Frustration Free Package&#34; it was a very simple matter to open the little cardboard envelop to retrieve the contents.  A side note here, I do appreciate the Amazon packaging for items such as this, where a clamshell type of container adds no value...The card is well made and seems a quality product.  Installed the card and it was recognized instantly on boot.  The full capacitywas recognized.Maybe I am old school when it comes to memory cards, but I always format them in the device I intend on using them (at least initially.)  In this case, there were no issues.While I haven't scientifically measured read / write speeds of the card, performance is respectable.  I have suffered no issuesrelated to the operation of the card.I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for this capacity and your device will accept the MicroSDXC format.  To that end, several friends have purchased (and been satisfied) with this memory card in their devices.",
"Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version. For my 7 version review, please search for my HDX 7 review.My profile: Im a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do. It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more",
"The Fire HD 7 is a great entry-level Fire Tablet that includes a 7 1200x800 216 ppi pixel density display. Pixel density wise, this is the lowest off all the Fire Tablets but is still decent enough where you're going to get a nice picture on the display. It's by no means an iPad killer or Galaxy Tab killer and you really shouldn't purchase it for that purpose. This particular model is really tailored to reading Kindle books, streaming video, browsing the web, checking email, and so forth. Bottom line, It's a great deal at 139. I'm going to compare the features of the HD 7 with the features of the other Fire Tablets to help you make an informed decision on which model to go with:*** DISPLAY ***The display is a 7 1200x800 resolution display with a 216 ppi pixel density which is not great, but not horrible either. It is the lowest pixel density of all the Fire Tablets with the Fire HD 6 coming in at 252 ppi, the Fire HDX coming in at 323 ppi, and the Fire HDX 8.9 coming in at 339 ppi. The human eye really can't distinguish individual pixels beyond a density of about 300 ppi so you're not going to be getting a noticeably pixelated display by any means. All in all, this is a nice display.*** PROCESSOR, GPU, AND ON-BOARD STORAGE ***The Fire HD 7 comes with a respectable 1.5 GHz quad-core processor with enough power to run almost all of your content with ease, including smooth video playback. It comes with a mediocre 1 GB of RAM which really is not sufficient in my opinion but it is what it is. THis is not an iPad or Galaxy Tab killer by any means, but it gives you just enough power to use the essential Amazon services you need.The HD 7 is substantially less powerful than the Snapdragon 2.2 GHz and 2.Read more",
64GB SDXC for $50...ish!!! Amazing price for a great product. Popped it into my Galaxy S4 and have had no problems so far.,
I bought it because it was a great price for the capacity and rated speed. I use it for storage in my Nook HD+,
"Ok, this won't be a technical review or a rating of measured speeds. It is simply a review from a consumer point of view. I have bought a couple of these MicroSDXC memory cards for tablets, and have seen no lag in saving data. I also use them for digital cameras, and have been very happy with the record time - it's instant. You can get into the MB/s on various cards, but usually, the difference is not something that anyone would notice or see. For the price, this is an excellent memory card, and I would highly recommend it.",
"Works like it's suppose to, quick and efficient, stable and reasonably priced. So far so good, put it in the camera and go.",
"Have had no issues and does what is advertised.  Very handy.  Quite happy. :)I've used it with:  Windows 7, Mac OS X.Formatted as: FAT32 and NTFSVery good card. :)",
What can I say. Plugged it in and it worked.Dell Venue 8 tablet.Have always had good luck with SanDisk brand.,
Works great in Canon 7d ( (microSD) to (SD adapter) to (SD to Compact flash adapter) for fast shooting and video.  Also works great with GO Pro models.  This card keeps up with the data rates required by the digital media devices todayRecommend this for Canon 7D* (*adapters needed) and GoPro.,
"Installed this into my new Galaxy tablet and sure is nice to have the extra memory, allows for additional apps.",
"Slipped perfectly into the microSD card slot of my Galaxy Note 2 and was immediately available. No formatting required, and writes to this card are fast enough to use it for video captures. Sweet!",
Very sturdy,
"If storage is what you need for your tablet, then this is pretty much a no brainer as long as it supports it :) Would recommend if you have a Galaxy Note 10.1",
I only buy SanDisk cards and this one is good just like I expected.  Great read and write speed and no issues whatsoever.  I also own the 64GB one and its just as good...Also comes with an adapter so you can use it in bigger/older size sd card slots.Buy with confidence!,
Purchased this along with the Nifty Minidrive for use as my Time Machine backup my Macbook Air 13&#34;. Perfect expansion!,
"I bought a couple of these to use with a GoPro HERO camera. Since I've never had bad luck with a SanDisk product, I chose this to store my precious photos and videos on. A class 10 device, it can not only store average video, photos and sound, but is fast enough the handle the 3 shot per half second rate the cameras multi-shot mode demands.",
"Listen - I got the SanDisk after I had a Kingston card in my phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 2) and it DIED after less than a year!!! Luckily, my phone was synced to dropbox, otherwise I would've lost valuable pics including our first summer family vacation!!! So far, so good with the SanDisk. It's been a few months. If there's a catastrophe, I'll update this review. But as of right now, it's working really well.",
I had an old Class 4 Kingston card in my phone and the thing just dragged when transferring music or photos. I finally decided I had enough with Class 4 and went looking for a reliable Class 10 card. This SanDisk does the trick. Now music and photo transfers fly like the wind. I can move over a FLAC album in about 30 seconds to my Droid Razr MAXX with no interruptions like I had on my Class 4 card.,
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",

I got this memory card for my daughter's Samsung compact camera so she could store and save many pics which it holds thousands.,
The 64gb version does not seem as reliable as the lower gb versions. I have had to reformat this card twice .. a real nuisance. When its working .. it does well.,
Super fast write speed makes using link2sd app work very well. Moving music and other media to this card from cable or reader is also much faster and im not completely sure but I think I can take photos faster as well.,

"This new KFHD replaces last year's basic Kindle Fire. Although it has some cool new features, it lacks a camera, microphone, and HDMI port. For this reason, I'm glad I kept my 2012 model since it does have these 3 features! Here are my initial impressions of the 2013 Kindle Fire HD: I like the placement of the on/off volume buttons. Being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one. I never cared for the carousel (this is what you see when you turn your Kindle on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed), and now there's an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead, and the apps/books can be rearranged to your liking. I was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar (which is now being called home). I don't know why Amazon removed this option, and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel. But you can still bookmark your favorite web pages YouTube videos for easy access. When I play songs purchased from Amazon's MP 3 store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style. Nice feature, but it doesn't work on every song. This device has a cool new feature called Quick Switch, which allows us, when reading or using an app, to bring up recently accessed items with a swipe instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one.In terms of sound, I find it to be tinny and not as rich as it is on the original KFHD. But you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds. Ironically, music sounds muffled unless you hold the device in landscape mode with your hands covering the speakers. Holding it this way projects the sound out to you.Read more",
works in the note 3 cant complain at all. the price is sweet. amazon is the best. thank you. thats all,
"I like its flexibility, portability and it is the best value option of all three Alexas",
"Seems like a good alternative to flash drive. Cost per gig seems like a pretty good deal, very convenient to carry around. I put my reading, music, pictures and videos on separate cards. Much more portable. Unfortunately smart phones and tablets are lagging.",
"After using it for a while, I have not issue at all.Have been taking pictures, videos, doing a lot of copy/paste/delete this little 32GB SD card. Not like my other SanDisk 32GB which only last for about 6 months.A small note. Not sure if it is the color or the design, the feel of the card (red/gray) is a little thicker then a regular black SD card. I also need to use little force to get the card out the digital cam. On the bright side, I do not have to worry about dropping the CD card like others since it does not slide out when try getting it out.",
I have two of these and use them for my Galazy Note 2. It's great having the flexibility to keep extra storage with you for your 'phablet'.So far they have done what they are intended to do.,
"More storage for my phone. Easy to insert, it's really small hence micro, so make sure you don't end up losing it before you get it into your phone. I'm really happy with this product and decent price too.",
"I like this product as it works very well. At first it only showed but when I plugged my camera using this micro-sdhc into my laptop and seen that this card had 2 partitions on it, I had to chose the correct one to use, otherwise I couldn't take many pictures or videos.",
"Works perfect, has no archive issues at all! Looks and feels pretty durable! Recommended for high end video and photography devices!",
I purchased and use with my Surface.  It stores quickly and is easy to use.  I really like that SanDisk makes it compatible with regular SDXC and Micro.  Good product.,
If you are a Prime member its a good little speaker to have. Need WIFI or Hotspot.,
They shipped it out to me right away. Was packaged well and it works very well in my GoPro camera.,
This is the perfect card for Your Gopro. All the speed and quality You need. And in the frustration free packaging also environmentally friendly.,
Perfect,
bought one for my GS3 phone and when I bought my wife the same got her one too.  They seem to work seamlessly.Perhaps over kill for us but cheaper per gig than smaller gig chips...,
"I've had the card for a month now, and it has given me no issues. The transfer speed is quite good; moving data from my old Class 4 device to this new one was arduous only due to the slower, older device. Any new material that I have to transfer to the phone zips along very fast.Now I have just that much more room for movies and music, which is exactly what I needed!",
"I have tried different SD cards in a Grpro Hero3 black edition, as it can record from 4k downwards none of my other cards had been able to use the full range, the recording stops after few seconds.This card make me record 4k, 2.7k, 1080 etc. different fps until the card is full or battery runs empty.Maybe i'm lucky, lots people said sandisk always giving them freezing and problems but i still go for it and i never had any problem.",
"This works as a case, and matches the color of the kindle nicely. The main feature I wanted was the stand, however. It is only one corner flap, as pictured. I incorrectly assumed there might be slightly more technology involved. There is no stop or anything to keep it from going completely flat backward. Starting out, my kindle would sit at a nice 70 degree or so angle from the table, but now my kindle will sit at maybe 30 degrees off the table. Eventually it will just go flat. I've had it for maybe 3 weeks. If the stand feature is important to you, get a different case.",
"Excellent delivery time, and the memory feels to read and write pretty fast.  I have a previous experience with a class 4 16GB micro sd.  This is a lot faster.",
Had no problems at all with this.  I have already purchased 2 more.  I would totally recomment this for storing photos or movies.,
"I bought this for my Samsung Tab 3, my pc, camera and cell phone. It is a great little drive to store music or files on. The price was excellent as well. Fast shipping, packed well. great deal all the way around.",
"Bought this for Galaxy S3, worked like a charm for 3 months & then I started getting error messages on phone stating the card has been taken out or that it is not there, went on like this for a week or so & then one day gone. Initially I thought it was problem with phone. Popped in a 2Gb card from BB & it worked. Popped this one into the BB & same, no detection. After spending so much on an SD card its disappointing to see it go bust outside of return period.",
"Pros:1. ordered it and got free shipping.2. got it in 3 days.3. popped it out of the box.4. popped it in the cellphone!5. Done!Cons:1. doesn't come with a hot pocket.2. Amazon won't marry me.3. took me too long to order the hell was I thinking.4. took too long to get it out of the box 1 second!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------update:Okay  I have to bring this rating down to 1 star.... My 64gb SD card just crapped out. I'm getting the ""0x80071ac3"" code and i cant format it or copy files to it. I ran scan disk and nothing works... I don't know if i will be buying any more SD cards again from them. luckily i was able to save all my files. I've goggled this problem and this is a common problem with these cards...",
"Just as advertised this microSDHC card works perfectly with our new smart phones, allowing LOTS of apps!  Highly recommended!TRY it, you'll like it!",
"Works great if you plan to have it in arms reach. You have to physically tap it to ask Alexa. Store rep knew what we wanted it for and never told us you had to tap, not voice activate. Returned to wait for indefinite out-of-stock Echo to get in eventually.",
"I bought three of these and all three worked upon initial installation with no formatting. Using my notebook computer's built in SD card reader, I saw transfer speeds between 6 Mb writing and 14 Mb reading. This was doing a simple ""copy / past"" of all files on my old card that I had saved to my computer. These speeds are much slower than the stated maximum by the card manufacturer, but would be expected with over 12,000 small files like my example. The read / write times were close to 50% faster than those of my old 8 Gb class 10 SanDisk micro SD card, so there is definitely a performance gain with this updated card.All things considered, 16 Gb of storage on a Class 10 card from the leading manufacturer, and at $15 is a steal. I highly recommend this card.",
No complains.  I have been using this card for a few weeks and have had no problems.  I am very pleased with it.,
"Really awesome tablet for my 5 year olds, and worth the money. Easy to figure out (for the most part), tons of apps, books and videos. My only complaint is that you cannot separate downloaded apps from the thousands of apps available to download on freetime. There is a carousel on the home page, but only shows the recently used apps. My children would have to scroll through the thousands of apps to find the ones that are downloaded with a check mark in the corner. I didn't want them to be able to download everything they see, which is easy to do with just a tap. The only solution I found was to block every app except those that are downloaded. You would think there would be an option separate them, given that this is made for a child, but I guess not",
I like the Amazon Tap. I use it as a speaker in my garage for working out. It is tied to my Amazon Echo. I am able to use Alexa and Amazon Prime material. Would highly recommend.,
Bought This For My Samsung Galaxy S3Load It Up With Music And It Works FlawlesslyI'm Very Satisfied With This Card,
Use this in my GoPro 3 silver edition.  Even at 1080p/30 I get about 9 hours of video.  Write time is great and I have had no problems writing video to this card real-time.  I have been happy with all of my SanDisk purchases.,
San disk is hard to beat.  You will pay more for the brand but you get a quality product.  Would purchase again.,
"No issues, plug and play.I have not run benchmarks, but I do store all of my camera and video data to the card. This includes a lot of high definition Daily Roads dashboard cam footage. There's no issues caching all of the temp video files, or storing the ones I opt to save due to the apparently speed and capacity of this card.The only con is the fact I waited so long to buy one. :)",
"The price is goodthe looking is nicethe speed is goodit came with an adaptershipping speed is excellentI used it with my Surface Pro & Samsung Galaxy S III, working good on bothThis is a good choice to have :)",
"So far has worked as expected, it's difficult to tell is it is going to fail or not soon but for the moment is working pretty well with a good performance.",
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
"Needs little to no formatting and I have yet to see a SanDisk fail. Don't cut corners, almost every other brand of SD cards will fail on you except these (tried numerous brands with my devices).Just remember it takes a bit for devices to buffer the information off of the SD card and static can corrupt any SD card which is usually easily fixed with a formatting. Always back up your documents to a PC/Mac as soon as possible.Oh, and if you create playlists, slideshows, etc. on devices and remove the SD card, the device will not be smart enough to re-compile it after you put the SD card back in and you will end up with blank playlists even though you have the songs so WATCH OUT!Lastly if this SD card doesn't work for you for whatever reason google SD card formatting and it should help you out. These 64GB versions don't seem to have formatting issues like the 32GB ones do but even then formatting to FAT32 fixes it.",
I bought this as soon as I heard that Amazon and Best Buy were the only retailers carrying it (for the time being).It arrived promptly and worked with my Galaxy Note II flawlessly. I have been recommending purchasing these to customers at the store I work at regularly to try and get more people aware of the benefits of mass storage on small devices.,
Works great in our smart phones.  Gives us a lot more memory.  Comes with an adapter if you require the ability to put it directly into your computer with a normal SD slot.,
Works flawlessly in my Note 10.1 2014 edition. You get a bout 62.5gb usable storage.The only thing I have noticed- and to be fair it is most likely the tablet or the app is a stutter when watching HD movies either downloaded fro Google Play or Samsung Hub [I had to use the free gift cards that came with the tablet for something].I have not noticed any real lag or stutter when using the camera app.$34.95 seems to be a fair price- these were about $100.00 earlier this year.,
Bought for my phone and its worked perfectly for quite a while now. Great size and great price. Cant go wrong with this.,
"I was very excited to buy this card (64 gb) for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - The product arrived promptly and I was able to format it to EX Fat and use it right away in my smart phone. However, exactly 10 days later when I removed the card (after turning off the phone) and inserted it in my Desktop, I got an error saying that the card was corrupted and unreadable and that I needed to format it.Since I had already got a lot of data on it, including a lot of videos and images of our new-born twins, formatting was not a viable option.I tried to get the card working on my PC Desktop, Mac Air laptop and the Samsung Galaxy Note, but to no avail.  Finally I decided to format it. There too, I kept getting errors and that the computer was unable to format the card.  Finally I tried ""Full Format"" via my pc - got an error again and then right away ""Quick Format"" and that worked - so the card is back and working in my Note again, but now I wont trust it anymore - not after having lost so many irreplaceable images and videos.I am a professional photographer, and use memory cards all the time - this has been the worst of the lot !!",
"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more",
The product it amazing love that it turns in lights on and plays my favorite music.,
"I purchased this after my wife and I bought our Samsung Galaxy S4 to store all the music, pictures and videos.  The S4 camera is capable of capturing 16-megapixels photos so the 16GB microSD that I had will not suffice.  As a matter of fact I've already exhausted the remaining space on the card so this 64GB will allow me to take more photos (of our son).",
Work great with my Samsung Galaxy S4. Simple to install and redirect in settings. I don't get the memory warnings anymore.,
"I bought two cards for tablets.  The first wouldn't format, so I bought another GSkill Class 10. The second worked, but only for 3-5 minutes. Then error, or freeze.  I thought it may have been the tablets.  However, the Gskill worked in both.....So I called Amazon.  The customer service was excellent.  There ""may"" have been a problem with one of their vendors......They shipped out two new cards with Saturday delivery.  It was ""implied"" through lengthy conversation with the Amazon Agent, that there were numerous problems with a particular company/vendor.Lesson:  Do NOT Hesitate To Call And Return if you get a card that seems to have ANY troubles out of the pack.I was surprised that my initial review was removed  from Amazon....So I am leaving another about the return.  II tried everything to fix these cards: fat32 ntfs and the newest exFat.....  There are definitely some damaged cards out there so be wary, and do not hesitate to call customer service!",
"I purchased this card to use in a GoPro Hero 3. It keeps up with the 1080p video being wrote to it. I don't know if it would do 4k video, but 16GB wouldn't be enough for that type of quality either. Bravo SanDisk.",
"I have no issues with this card, and my phone now boots much faster than before with my old 8gb class 4 card.",
"I purchased this Micro SD card with adapter to supplement my UltraBook which came with a MSata storage of only 128Gb.The 64 GB SD Card is a whole lot of storage and the prices of these have fallen to low in recent times and believe will fall further as newer technologies will come.I would recommend this 64GB original SanDisk Micro SD card for anyone who needs large storage space at good prices, especially for the Samsung Galaxy S2 & S3 or the UltraBooks.",
"I bought this for my LG Optimus G Pro, to hold my 24 GB music collection - it works great.  It took a while to transfer all my music, but that can be expected.  Once I popped this into the phone and started us the music player, it found a cataloged all my music.  I don't like the latest default Android music player, but that's another story (and there are other music players you can download).",
"The card was working great. I own quite a few for several of my devices. One that I bough in 2012 suddenly died. I went to the SanDisk website and did a chat support. The Tech tried some quick troubleshooting and after about five minutes asked for my info for an RMA. The process was quick and easy. Like I said, this one suddenly died, no idea why. Luckily I didn't have anything important on it at the time. This is the only one I've ever had fail, and like I said, the RMA process was a breeze. I really like these cards and the customer service was great. For reference, I run these cards in a Samsung Galaxy SII (hercules) - 32 gb, Motorola Droid (sholes) - 16 gb, Motorola Droid 3 (solana) - 32 gb, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2012) (GT-N8013) -32 gb, it was the Note one that failed. I also have a GoPro but I run the golden SanDisk cards in that, but they are twice the price! I will continue to buy these cards regardless of this isolated incident.",
I love this. I am using it to add additional storage space to my MB AIR together with the minidrive. I may not have comparable speed to an actual SSD but for audio files and photos it is good.,
"WORKS great, better than I thought - IF you cave a SURFACE TABLET  I truly recommend it it will work straight away.",
Very happy with this card. It gives my 32gb Galaxy Note II an extra 64GB of Storage and it's fast.,
"This card works great with my Garmin Zumo GPS unit.  I mainly use it to hold vast numbers of songs, and it works great for that.  It is fast enough that my Nuvo has no difficulty accessing the memory and I note no slowdown in performance of the GPS.  Comes with an adaptor so you can use it in a regular SD card reader.  For my needs this one is perfect, hence the five star rating.  RJB.",
"5 months ago I placed this in a Galaxy phone and instantly increased storage by 200 percent. Worked and still works perfectly, and I was able to move all my pics, videos, and e-books to it. freeing up internal storage for apps.  Recommended.",
Great sound..easy to connect..problem is.. its not voice activated..so u have to push the wake button anytime u need to use it..that means it has b close at hand...,
Hi I bought One but it is dont work in my Country Saudi Arabia Is ther Anysolution . Thanks,

"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad.

Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the Fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50 more pixels per inch than the Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:The initial Wi-Fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series. After the final operating software update I mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version of the Fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the HD Fire, as well as last year's 8.9 HD Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7 Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My normal website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7 Kindle Fire HD yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker. The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass. However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am). While the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time - I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers. The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account, both with the software came with the Fire but my primary use of an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store. I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via Google's calendar and contacts. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same. Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be. If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it). For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app/a here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader. Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment. I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger! If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for 20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.Mayday button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's regular model of the Fire, is the introduction of the Mayday button. Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent. I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say hi' for purposes of this review.What I Wish it Had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the Fire was ready (why are we waiting). A case is very important in order to protect your investment. Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at 229 for the 16GB of memory model (309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD at 139.

Good fast and inexpensive microSD - noticeably faster for most tasks than the class 4's that are hanging around. So useful for when you don't have access to your cloud storage.,
"Copied all the data from my phone 16GB sdcard to the new 32GB and everything worked fine the first time the card was installed. I had previously done the same with an 8GB to 16GB with same results. It does not increase an speed to the phone as it is controlled by phones operating system,",
"I didn't run any metric software on this chip as some others have done, but I can tell you it's a pretty spicey little guy.  Everything I store on it via my ASUS TF300T is accessible faster than any other chip I've tried.  Some videos that ""stuttered"" using other chips are fluid with this one.",
Pay attention to your application and what class your card is!  Class 4 or unclassed may be cheaper but it may not give you the performance you want. Don't be pennywise and poundfoolish... this was purchased to go into one of the newer MK808 version tv streamer dongles and those take class 10. For the price this was a good value.I have been using SanDisk xD and sD regular and micro for 8 years now and always found them to be a consistent and high grade storage card. I can recommend this brand.,
"..exactly what I wanted, but the battery drains FAST when on hands free mode.",
"Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I cannot think of any complaints.  Other than it is very small......  Be very careful.  I am glad they put some red on this - makes it easier to find if you should drop it,",

"Monday, November 26, 2012I put this in the Galaxy S3 without formatting, restarted the phone and it showed 59.4g GB of space.  I transferred all the files from the old 16 GB card and then moved all my music to the card with the phone connected to my computer by the USB cord.  Still lots of space left and the various music players seem to see all the music.Tuesday, November 27, 2012The card didn't show up on the phone this afternoon.  No message, just no songs to play and no card according to everything I could check on the phone.  I restarted the phone and got a notification that the SD card was corrupt, needed formatting and that I would loose all data on the card.  I restarted the phone again, without formatting, and the card came up like it had never been missing.  I am writing this on Thursday, 11/29 and I have not had another issue with the card.December 6Well, I don't know what to think.  The card disappeared again and I reformatted it FAT32 in an attempt to fix the problem.  The whole point of getting this large card was to have my music on my phone and not have to stream it from the cloud.  I tried several music players and went with PowerAmp because of the good reviews and that I could specify the folder to play from.  So PowerAmp is looking for the folder /mnt/extSdCard/Music and playing the songs in all the subfolders.  It is PowerAmp that tells me that folder is not available.The card has gone missing one other time and restarting the phone fixed the problem.Today, PowerAmp would not play and when I got home I found the Music folder was gone.  I also had Ringtones folder and it was also gone.  Now, I may not be the sharpest saw in the shed, but I know I did not delete those folders.  The card had other folders but not those two so it had not been reformatted.I am starting to think the problem is with the Galaxy S3.  I had a 16 GB FAT32 card in this phone that had been in my previous HTC phone.  That card was not large enough to held my music so I don't know if it was disappearing or not.  I wish this combination of phone and 64GB card was more reliable but just don't know where the problem lies.I lowered the stars from 4 to 3 but I really don't know if the problem is with the card, the phone or both.  All I know is that they do not seem to be playing well together.December 7There was a notification on the phone this morning that the SD card was corrupted and needed to be formatted.  I restarted the phone several times and got the notification each time.  I reformatted the SD card using the phone, a step I don't think I have tried yet.December 8Another MINOR problem I have is that the message counter gets stuck on 1 when I have no new messages.  The only fix I have found is to restart the phone.  That happened this morning and I got the corrupted card message again, but restarted again and the card came up OK.December 11So, the files on the card keep disappearing.  The card is mounted and the phone shows the correct free memory but PowerAmp, and file directory programs do not see any files on the card.  I restart the phone and the files come back.  Very strange.  I played music on and off all day today without a problem and then this evening all the files disappeared again. Restarted the phone and all is well again.December 15My phone upgraded to 4.1.1 yesterday and the same issues remain.  It is a crap shoot as to if music will play.  I take a lot of photos and use the service Zenfolio to store and display them.  I have an app that syncs with Zenfolio and keeps a phone size version of the photos on my phone.  I set this app to store the photos on the Samsung SD card and have similar issues with it when the data on the phone goes away.  This morning the SD card came up as corrupt again after a restart to get the data back.  It took a total of 3 restarts to get the music and photos back.December 18I have been trying to play music stored on this card today and my phone has reset several times.  Very frustrating.  I ordered a SanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFP today for about $25.00 and I'll see if I have the same issues.  Very disappointing.December 28I purchased and installed theSanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFPand copied all the files from the 64GB card to the new 32GB card.  No formatting, no fuss, no muss.  I have not had a phone reset since, have played music through Bluetooth for hours in the car, have viewed photos.  Everything just works.  Half the memory but what I have is always available and the phone works, a good trade off.  I am still disappointed that the 64GB did not work with the SG3.  I have purchased aelago Mobile Nano II USB 2.0 microSDHC Flash Memory Card Reader (Black)to use the 64GB MicroSDHC card as a thumb drive.",

"My Samsung Galaxy S4 now has 119GB of fast microSDXC flash card storage available. At Amazon's rather amazing price, it works out to 94 cents a Gigabyte. Way back when, in the early days of hard drive storage, I paid as much as $500 per Megabyte!This little hummer is fast. The package and ads claim read speeds up to 30 MB/s. My own CrystalMark tests indicate 33.77 MB/s Read and 28.80 MB/s Write.With storage capacity like this and continuing software development, the smartphone and small tablet just might be the future of computing.My initial impression is simple one of awe: 119GB of usable storage in a chip not even the size of my thumbnail.If you have a device that will support microSDXC cards, buy one of these. You can never have too much storage, but you will definitely be hard-pressed to fill this card up with your personally useful data.Great device - great buy.Jerry",
It's an SD card that works fine and is pretty quick.  Not much else I can say about the product.,
"It appears that the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Micro SD Card I purchased from Amazon was defective.  I installed it in my Samsung Tablet, but could not successfully transfer files using either a USB cable or WiFi.  The file transfer would appear to start, but then would slow down and hang completely.  It did this on every one of multiple attempts, with different file types, and numbers of files ranging from many to just a single file.  I tried loading files onto the card directly from my PC, but then the Tablet would not see them.  I tried reformatting the card both in my PC and in the Tablet, but still got the same result.  After a few tries, the Tablet would appear to format the card but then tell me that the card was blank/unformatted.  I did an A/B/A with an old 8GB Sandisk Micro SD Card that I had laying around.  It worked perfectly -- formating, transferring files, reading and writing files -- everthing worked.  I put the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Card back in the Tablet, but had the same problems again.  I concluded that the SanDisk Ultra card was defective and returned it.  I'm still using the old 8GB card without a hiccup.The good thing was that Amazon's return policy was quick and painless.",
"I needed a large capacity, dependable high speed card for my action cam on a fishing trip and this card delivered in spades! Recording and playback were flawless.",
"Pros: Looks good, works fine until it starts acting up.Cons : Worked for 6-8 months in 2 Samsung S3 phones, and 3 months in a Samsung Galaxy Note 8. One by one they all died, became unreadable. Cannot format either. Just dead. Wasted.Sandisk did not post any disclaimers like don't bother to use this in a Samsung device.",

"It feels odd to give 5 stars to something that disappeared into a piece of electronics, but to be fair, it works as promised, and there is nothing wrong with it.  I use it to store the digital map for my Garmin 810 bike GPS/computer.  The file is about 4Gb in size. The map loads quickly in the Garmin, and I have not had a problem with entering a bike route or navigating one.  I have taken it out twice, a 42 mile ride and a 60 mile ride, and it worked flawlessly both times.  'Nuff said.",
this thing is amazing. I wish there was someplace you could go to see ALL the titles available on prime. everything I've seen shows a few here and a few there but this device is terrific highly recommended,
Works on my Samsung Galaxy Note II. SanDisk is a product you can trust. Cheapest price I could find. Thanks!,
"I purchased this memory card for use in a Galaxy S2 smart phone.  Music stored on the card plays without problems.  Works great and while not the cheapest, the price was not bad.********Update 11-28-12*********After about 1 month of use, the card failed.  After a few emails to SanDisk, they issued and RMA and promptly provided a warranty replacement.  On the whole great service.  These things are tiny and some failures are expected, so as long as this one keeps working, I still give it 5 stars.",
Pictures were bright and sharp and download from the camera to the card very quickly. If you have a better quality camera this is a great card,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
I bought this for my new Galaxy III and I have to say that it is super fast at loading up when I insert it and I have had no problems with it or glitches so far. I got it as a deal of the day and it was a bargain!!,
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)br /br /I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.br /br /FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.br /br /AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.br /I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.br /One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.br /I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)br /br /LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
Hopefully these will get cheaper but worth every cent to have more recording time I used 5 of these for Christmas work great and you have good eyes !!!,
I got it when it was on sale (66% off list price!) and already it has paid for itself.  I'm glad to be able to have more memory for my tablet and am very happy that it comes with and SD card adaptor so that I can transfer pictures straight from my camera to my table.,

I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine.

Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added.

"I got my first Kindle. This is a nice ebook reader. I'm going to jump right in and tell you what I found to be its Pros and Cons. Then I'm going to tell how it compares to its biggest competitor, the Barnes Noble Nook Simple Touch.Kindle's Pros:Great Screen: Many people do not find LCDs hard to read on (e.g. smartphones, tablets, Kindle Fire, Nook Color, etc.), but virtually everyone will find E-Ink easier to read, any time of day. Especially the newest E-Ink Pearl displays. They simply look like paper and ink. I have never experienced any eye strain reading E-Ink book readers, but I have with LCD based phone/tablet screens.Thin and Lightweight: This Kindle is thinner than any paperback and lighter too. This makes it very easy to hold in a sitting position, and for long periods too. It also makes it easy to transport in a purse, backpack, or messenger bag (or in luggage for traveling). Many people like to take a few books when travelling, and this Kindle lets you take as many as you want and adds virtually nothing to your travel burden.Good Value: Even without a touchscreen, the Kindle is a good value. It is a well-made product, it offers cloud storage of your books (and well it should, since it offers no ability to expand storage capacity with an add-in microSD card), the screen is excellent, Amazon is a dogged competitor in book pricing. The Kindle 4 is the best value of Amazon's E-Ink readers. Some may be tempted to get the version with the built-in light. If you can afford it, sure, go ahead. But let me point out you don't have to spend 20 for a fancy-schmancy book light. Your local dollar store has them for ... wait for it ... a buck.Read more",
"$20. less money than comparable Samsung. Very fast. Installs easily. Would recommend to a friend. Also, I appreciate the &#34;user friendly&#34; packaging.",
"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more",
Tried this in my Gopro Silver camera. So for seems to work.Put card in Adapter to transfer files and had a very hard time removing it again. Will not try the adapter again with this card.,
Installed it to my Galaxy S4. Works great!I want more.. waiting for price to go down.. and I wish 128GB comes out soon so I can buy it,
perfect memory card for cell phone use; great amount of storage and has really good read/write speeds. would recommend to others,
I am in love with the Alexa Tap. This is a great portable speaker and now that the added function of being able to talk to it without manually pushing the button sets this apart from the rest. I would recommend to all.,
"Plugged this little gem into my 1520 and now have a huge amount of memory for video, kindle downloads, and music.",
"Bought this for my Note 10.1 for some extra space(also use one in my Note 2) No problem being recognized. Now if only Samsung would let me install apps on it, but that's not the cards fault.",
We need lots of room in the memory card.  I think there is plenty in this card and San Disk always hss a great product.,
"After buying the SanDisk Ultra no other card speeds will do.  Whether watching videos, playing music or transferring files over ftp, this card handles it very well.",
"If you want tons of capacity, here it is.  Bought mine on a pretty good sale, works perfectly, as I'd expected from SanDisk.",
"Doesn't understand some commands or Questions,but good overall",
Great microSD card for your phone to upgrade you with additional 32 gigs of space.  The beauty of having a huge microSD in your phone is that you can store all of your music and pictures and stuff on there and then swap it into a new phone or replacement when that happens and not have to transfer anything over manually.,
"There are a number of MicroSD manufacturers out there that offer large capacity cards like this. They claim to be Class 10 but when tested, prove to be closer to Class 6 cards in performance. This SanDisk card performs at the Class 10 level.I use these cards in various devices that NEED Class 10 speeds, such as my Android phone because of the data transfers I do for work and for the games I keep on it.If your device does not need Class 10 (you are just using it for simple storage of basic files like docs or ebooks) then you could probably save some money by going with Class 6. If the prices are very close, then you might as well spend the extra money and get Class 10.This card came with a nice plastic storage case and a SD adapter. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I feel the prices should be a lot lower by now. Inventory is plentiful and these are not cutting edge tech any more.",

Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  It works well with my camera using its standard size adapter and then is readable by my Note 8.  Seems quick enough for my Canon G12.  I would recommend this.,
"It arrived quickly, was easy to install, now, if I can just figure out how to save data onto it from my device...",
Great for kids. Makes it easy for them to hold the fire and great protection for when it drops. Nothing protecting the screen though but so far that hasn't been an issue.,
"This is the second card I've purchased of this exact model.  The first one I had went bad after about 8 months.  To be fair, I had it in a rooted Galaxy S3 with CM10.1 loaded on it.  So it's possible that something in the experimental firmware messed up the card.I'm back on the stock rom now due to issues with 4G LTE.  I'm not even rooted anymore.  So I'm hoping that the card remains solid this time.  Everyone else seems to love it so I'm hoping serves me well for a long time.So far... So good...",
First rate - high quality!,
Couldn't find this in the local stores. It is what we needed and it was brand new as stated and works great.,
The last I heard this memory card works great. I gave it as a Christmas gift. The person I gave it to says it works great.,
"This product is ok, wasn't too impressed with the commercial was defiantly more interesting",
"Use it in Sammy Tab 2, formatted in a HTC phone, then put in in the tab 2......",

"As a Kindle case, this works, but it's got a few too many negatives.To the good, it's nice and thick, meaning it gives good protection, and your Kindle snaps into it rather than just sitting in it like my 7 HDX's magnetic case, meaning your Kindle won't fall out if you tip it too far.However.1. I hate the flap this has for propping it up. Maybe I was spoiled by my last Kindle's case, but I had one of the magnetic origami ones, and the case folded into a very solid support that would hold the Kindle up on either of the long sides. This one's flap isn't magnetic, and it's just one diagonal fold, which makes gives far less support. The thing tips over or collapses more than I'd like it to, and if I want to read in landscape orientation (i.e. the long sides go left to right rather than up and down), the top and bottom aren't interchangeable. That wouldn't normally be a problem, but...2. There's a camera on the back of the Kindle 8, and the case has a hole for it. The problem is, there's only one hole, which means there's a right way and a wrong way to put the Kindle into it. Like I said, none of this would normally be a problem, except I sometimes use it while it's charging, and my outlet is on the left side of the bed. Naturally, the stand puts the USB thing on the right side of the Kindle. Assuming I don't want to cover the camera, I can either prop it up while I read, or let it charge while I read, but not both. (I'll probably order a longer USB cable, but the one the Kindle comes with is too short to wrap around to the other side.) I wish they'd punched two holes in the back and given us options for which direction the Kindle fits.3. It's got a canvassy sort of fabric covering rather than a hard plastic one like my last case.Read more",
does what is was designed,
exactly what it says and cheap,
Initially when I inserted the card into the Samsung Galaxy S3 it recognized it but it wasn't able to format it correctly. After doing some research I found a free program EaseUS Partition Master [...] that will format the card into FAT 32 since Windows no longer allows you to do it by default. After formatting it into fat 32 the phone recognized the card and it works great now. I hope this helps anyone else that might run into this problem.,
"Works great, no issues so far. Speed is fairly good, alot better then my 2gb I had in an old camera.",
"I really wanted a 128 GB card, but at less than half the price, as well as actually being in stock right now, this is a good buy, and works well. I couldn't find anyone that would say for sure when I was looking to buy, but this is compatible with Mac.",
"Screaming deal on this retail-packaged 32gb microsd. I have not benchmarked it, but it is lightyears faster than my original 2gb card. Retail packaging (though I don't like extra packaging) makes me more secure that this is not a fake.",
Everything works great on my note 2. I can even do super slow motion video and have never had a dropped frame.,
It's mini storage.  It doesn't do anything else and it's not supposed to.  I purchased it to add additional storage to my Microsoft Surface Pro tablet which only come in 64 and 128 GB.  It does what it's supposed to and SanDisk has a long standing reputation that speaks for itself.,
"boost the mp3 player size thanks, more more if you have the music or video's can not go wrong with more memory",
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Now I have 96GB total memory! Awesome! The price was quite good too,
Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....,
"I installed this in a tablet that I am giving as a gift, and so far so good. This is the second one I purchased I installed the first one in my tablet and it seems to be working fine also.",
"Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version. For my 7 version review, please search for my HDX 7 review.My profile: Im a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do. It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more",
"When it comes to any kind of flash storage SanDisk has always been my go to brand because they sell quality items and stand by them if there's a problem. So as usual no complaints here, it works as descried and I haven't have any issues. Both read and write speeds are right where the specs say they should be.",
"Bought this for the GoPro Hero3 and it works as advertised with no issues. Since I bought this, I have learned to watch for sales because they tend to get deeply discounted at local retailers every once in a while.",
"Since my wireless carrier didn't sell a S4 version with more than 16gb of memory, I wanted something to add a bit more storage space to my phone. Got this on sale for $42.99 and I couldn't be happier with how it performs so far.",
"NOTE:  please read the last update (scroll to the bottom) - I'm leaving this review as 1 star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experience.I give SanDisk 5 stars for customer service and 1 star for the product (for those manufactured in the past)  For those newly manufactured products that contain the software ROM fix, I'd give the product 5 stars.To all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews.... and then used it in a Galaxy S4 (GS4) smartphone for storage, the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to SanDisk for a replacement under warranty.  Believe me I tried everything that the Google searches returned as solutions... formatting as exFAT, formatting in the GS4 then copying data to the card while in the phone etc.... nothing worked... and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which I hope to get soon (just RMA'd and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warranty).The problem (As confirmed from the SanDisk customer support rep when I asked specifically asked him):- When used in the GS4, this card will unmount itself inadvertently (may be true only for cards manufactured before the ROM patch described below was implemented in manufacturing).  This can cause the data to become corrupt (luckily was not my experience) and / or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving 13 MP camera pictures to the card (or MP4 movies that stop in the middle of the movie) and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse, right when you take the picture (this was the issue I experienced).- SanDisk knows about this issue.  Again, SANDISK KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE AND WILL REPLACE YOUR CARD. Call them (info below) and they WILL take care of it under warranty.  They have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it. (sorry SanDisk about the 1 star, but I thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution)- The customer rep told me that SanDisk tried to work with Samsung to resolve the issue but Samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones (especially their flagship GS4 phones).- The customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras (not Samsung GS4 phones with cameras, obviously) and even worked fine in some phones from HTC etc. that could accommodate the 64 GB cards. Hence the 5 star ratings from others.- The solution SanDisk came up with was to write a patch into the ROM of the card itself to specifically address the issue on Samsung GS4 phones (and maybe other Samsung phones like the GS3).  I was assured that the new card I would get would work flawlessly. will see in about 3 weeks.- I purchased my card from Amazon June 2013, so the ones currently being manufactured and the one I should get will have the new patch.  However, as SanDisk manufactures in batches (like most of the industry), old batches of ""unpatched"" cards obviously exist in warehouses.- I asked about a software patch I could download and was told it's not possible... hence the ""hard coded patch"" in the card's ROMSo... how to take care of the problem....After speaking with the SanDisk US customer support (link and info below), this is what I learned and did.Go to the SanDisk site1) [...]2) call consumer products support (this is the US no.) 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)3) Tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your GS4 (I assume this is also a problem experienced by GS3 owners too)4) They will then confirm your information, approve your return (10-15 min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously), and then send you emails with a UPS return label and instructions.5) BTW, they also asked if I had a magnifying glass to ID the serial no. on the card, but I didn't and couldn't read it myself (those numbers are super small printed into the plastic... don't believe me?  take a look yourself.)  I told the rep I couldn't read them and he said no problem, they would process without the serial no.  I assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in.  Makes sense.Well, that's it.  Problem (hopefully) solved.  Let's see in 2-3 weeks.  The rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem.  KUDOS TO SANDISK FOR TAKING CARE OF IT... however, it would be nice if there was some type of communication / notice of the issue besides Google info sources, forums etc.  I spent hours, maybe a couple of days total hours worth, thinking it was an issue with my phone / my data transfer.  oh well, that's how it goes.I really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me.  GOOD LUCK!!(btw, I'd give the card 5 stars if this problem was solved in the patched ROM of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card (tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer)... if the data transfer / remaining mounted in the GS4 issue never existed (pre-patch of ROM, of course))UPDATE: 08/17/2013 - All went well with the return of the SanDisk Storage card.  UPS shipping took about 2 days from when I sent it, SanDisk verified the warranty claim 1 day later and 5 hours later that same day, my replacement card had been shipped. waiting on the new card now, but expect to test it out very soon (early next week).  will update the post after testing out the new card.  Just as a reference, I've been using a 32GB Micro SD HC SanDisk card in the GS4 since having shipped the 64GB card.  Obviously it's a different card and not the Micro SD XC kind. Other than a bit slower access speeds to the card, absolutely zero problems.... well if you don't count that it's basically filled up, hence why the 64GB option is great on the GS4. So it proves the point on the problem with the early build Micro SD XC 64GB cards.I'm happy to see that my review has helped some others out there.  Good luck to you in your warranty claim. my experience with SanDisk customer support has been excellent so far.Update: 08/21/2013 - Received the new replacement SanDisk Storage card just a few days ago (shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window).  Have had it running in the Galaxy S4 for a few days now without any jumps, stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking.  Card seems to work flawlessly as the SanDisk Rep mentioned it would. One would think it's such a short time to test after a few days of use, but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first 45 minutes... that's how often and how fast it was occurring. so it would seem the problem is solved. The new SD card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card.  Thanks SanDisk!  Unless I update this review by next week, you will know that the problem has been fixed.Good luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to SanDisks great responsive customer service.Update: 08/31/2013 - This is the last update to this review just to ""close the loop"".  The new replacement card from SanDisk has been running flawlessly for about 2 weeks now.  I have not experienced any of the initial problems.  SanDisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cards.Update: 12/09/2013 - The card has been running in my GS4 flawlessly since replacing it around Aug 21st.  Pretty good track record so far (~ 3.5 months) so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured (replacement) cards.For those that have left comments that I should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed (see my addition at the beginning of this review)... When searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product, most people start at the 1 star reviews to see what others have experienced.  This is especially true for products with a lot of reviews (this is what I did in the beginning with this product).  Therefore I think leaving it at 1 star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review.Thanks to review commenter ""Da Shocker"" for his input.  I think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like this:""One more thing.. to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one. Take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star. A card cost $50-$100 pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless.. """,
I have seen this other places and they can&#8217;t beat the price it has saved from using up my main hard drive makes it a 96 instead of 28 which it came with,
Changes the whole look of the Echo ... after i purchased i think i should have gone with the tan leather. But blue is my favorite color and it adds a bit of a pop to a mundane looking black disk! The texture is also really nice feel and look to it!,
"I recently bought a new phone with a lower storage amount and supplement it with this external SD card.  So far I haven't had any issues with the phone recognizing and playing files from the card and being cheaper than anything comparable I would have found in a store, this works!",
"I am cautiously optimistic but happy because Amazon sent my replacement promptly. I ordered a 32gb card and it came broken, so i returned with followed with an email asking for immediate shipping...and it arrived just in time for my trip. i am cautiously optimistic because out of four cards I have purchased from Amazon, this is the only one that works so far. but i got refunded for the rest.",
You just can't beat actual SanDisk quality - DON&#34;T GO FOR THE COUNTERFITS !!This memory Rocks and has worked fantastic for me.Great Purchase !,
Amazon Tap is exactly what I expected it would be. The sound quality is good with the Alexa features. I love that you can charge it on the base or with micro USB cord. I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in Amazon Echo and would like the portability.,
love it planty of space for my pictures and videos and more very small and can be use in other items,
"I haven't experienced any issues with this card yet.I got it for a very good price and am very happy with it. My last Micro SD card failed on me after a few months of use and I lost everything I had (nothing was recoverable...)This one, though seems to work perfectly as designed and I haven't had an issue with it yet.Five stars because it does what I expect it to do and hasn't failed me.",
Bought (3) 32GB micro memory cards for the kids tablets. The kids love the extra memory although they do need new tablets now.,
I'm using the card in my new Samsung S4 phone. Work as it should. No Problem. This is the largest size I can use.,
"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysJuly 30, 2014Hi Dallas, thank you for sharing your feedback.

"Besides the missing app functionality (check compatibility before purchasing), it does exactly what I want it to.",
This is a great memory card that I've put into my phone for music and picture storage.  It works exactly as advertised.,
"I purchased this for my gopro hero 3 and it worked ok for a while, then suddenly the camera would only record about 10 seconds at a time.  After reading some forums online, I was prompted to swap this Sandisk out for a Samsung card.  All of my problems went away!  I still use this card for random storage, but I won't use it in a camera again.",
Used it for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 tablet.  Stopped working after about 10 months without warnings.  My tablet now recognizes as blank or un-formatted card; my computers won't even recognize it at all!  I am still trying to recover some priceless photos of my kids since my last backup of the card...,
"I put in my IdeaTab and what do you know? another 60 GB of space for documents. So far, no issues at all.",
"I have buy the SDXC for Xperia Arc S even many was saying it support till 32GB SDHC, The SDXC 64GB work perfectly on the Xperia Arc S",
"There is no question about Sandisk, and their continued innovation with really keeping storage from any computer for those on the go. With any need for electronic files, or music or games securely stored and protected from computer to phones and MP3 Players and tablets, Micro SD Cards are becoming a increased need for laptops and computer needs. Sandisk has made several products through time, and they have continued to get better with innovation. Their Ultra Micro SDHC memory card handles very well. It works nicely with storing all my media files into one convient package. I like it because I can safely have all my MP3 files, in this card and play them with my Sandisk MP3 Player nicely. This is definitely a good buy for anyone that really wants a bit of extra space. I definitely recommend this Micro SD memory card for all the extra storage space.Price: BConvience: B+Overall: B 1/2+",
Got a Transformer Infinity Tablet (32 GB) which was a decent amount to begin with; However I wanted a microSD to double it to have a decent storage size. I decided to go with SanDisk since I've never gotten any bad portable storage from them before.MicroSD is still working fine in my tablet. Has my videos I wanna watch on the go when I have my tablet. Also useful to store and apps to for installation.,
Another necessity for the Go-Pro's that I feel should at least come with the Go-Pro's. At least a smaller GB to get you recording right out of the box. Too afraid to purchase an off-brand in fear of it not being compatible with the camera.,
"this company is as about as good as amazon. They offer a great product, great customer service at a fair price. They just work well together, Dont sweat it just buy it, its a no brain er.",
"Very fast card, works great in my GS4. I wanted something very fast but reliable and this is the ticket.",
6 months later and no problems. It's a very solid product and I'm very happy with it. Would order again.,
"What can I say . . . ? It's a SanDisk Class 10! They have been making SD, USB, and micro SD cards a long time!",
Before I bought this I had a blue tooth speaker and an iPod touch. Both of which had to be charged and turned on etc. now I just tell Alexa to play music.,
Also fast .. Not much more I can say. I bought two.Would buy again and would recommend to u all,
Great storage for the price (&#60; $1 per GB). The only draw-back is that they are rather slow to write to.,
Works great for the month I have had it in my Galaxy S3.  I purchased this to go in my Samsung Galaxy S 3 and was super excited I didn't need to buck up more money for the 32GB phone.  Well *dumb* me did not know the the SG3 does not allow apps to be moved to an external SD card.  I thouhgt I had researched everything but I missed that.  The card works fin and I can store umpteen thousand pictures not that I have figured out how and I might even be able to figure out how to put a movie onto it but what a waste of a GREAT SD card.Pro: Top of the line cardCon: SSG3 and most new smartphones won't allow apps to sd even with the micro sd card option on the phone,
"With an 8oo dollar phone, I want as most as I can get, and this mem card was the way to go.",
"I got this memory card for my Samsung Galaxy S3. I was running out of room on my Sandisk 32gb Class 4 micro sd card. I also wanted a faster and more durable card. I was hopping to put lots of media on it. In addition to nandroid backups and custom roms. I later found out that since this card is formatted in ex-fat it would not work to make nandroid backups or flash custom roms. Most custom recovery and custom roms dont work with ex-fat. So my only choice was to format the card to fat 32, which meant I couldn't put any files larger than 4gb on it. Besides that this card is great and very reasonable price of $50. If your some one who doesn't root their phone or put custom roms, nandroid backups or put files larger than 4gb than this will not affect you. This memory card is fast and provides the most storage you can put on your mobile device at this time. The card is also water proof, shock proof and comes with lifetime warranty. Ive never had any issues with sandisk memory cards or usb flash drives. They last a really long time.",
We all know these are the best in the industry - very quick transfers and very nice results from these micro's.,
I have plenty of space for my pics and songs that I store on my SD card. The adaptor helps in easy transfer to my laptop.,
Not much else to say - an SD card is an SD card - performance met expectations - have had good luck with Sandisk,
"I put this in my Galaxy S4 phone for extra storage and it works perfectly.  I copied my music collection (about 5000 MP3 songs) and put 20 MP4 movies on it with room to spare.  Very handy for listening and watching while traveling on a plane.  The phone likes it, the computer likes it, so I like it.",
"Works great! very fast too. I bought this for my Galaxy Note 3. Now I can have lots of pictures and movies on my phone. For only $115, it is a pretty good deal. Too bad Iphone and ipads don't have this option.",
got this for a good price. Works great. Use it in my Droid Razr M. I store all my music and some important files on my phone with room to spare. great buy,
Even as a speaker alone this item is worth the price!,
"I have used many memory devices from SanDisk, as well as a couple of Sansa MP3 players. This card lives up to my expectations. It works well in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. I haven't bothered with the adapter, but I have no doubt it does its job. It is nice to have it just in case I need to read the card outside the phone.",
Great micro sd card and for 35$ its extremely cheap. Got 2 of thoses and i`ve never looked back. UHS1 = fast!,
"Bought this by accident for my Samsung Galaxy s3 but the phone reads it and accepts all 64 gb so I am a happy camper. Worked the first time so I bought one more for my Galaxy Tab 2. Again, no problems! Awesome card!",
"Works great, in my phone now I was running out of space but this came to the rescue now I can take more pics!!!",
My wife uses the Tap mostly to listen to music. She loves the fact that she can take it into aNY room of the house. No more having to turn up the sound to hear I'm different parts of the house.,
As Advertised.  Appears to be working okay. No faults have occurred yet with the micro card.Would buy again. A+,
"I purchased this product for my Samsung Galxy Tab Pro 10.1, and so far it's been flawless. Everything works just right.",
"This memory card is about as fast as they come and provides easy file transfer. You are likely to need the included adapter, so it is great that it is included.Recommended",
Works perfectly with the transfer of data from my gopro to my laptop! I suggest anyone buy this one because it is good quality,
"Price was spot on where it should be ($24.99) so less than $1/GB for storage...nice. Solid design, easy to mount, recognized the card immediately in my Samsung Galaxy II Tablet, never had any errors, and the read/write speeds have been amazingly fast.",
"Advertised speedWorks right out of the box, no formatting requiredTrusted nameThis is a no-brainerSamsung has started to make their own line of sd cards and they seem to be cheaper at the moment when compared to the sandisk.",
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
"I have this installed in my Verizon Rezound Android phone and it works perfect. Many phones advertise they support up to 32Gb of memory when in reality, they will work with 64Gb too.",
"I had a cheap 8 GB SDHC card that just would not behave itself in my Android phone and kept throwing errors and becoming corrupt. I looked into getting the 64 GB Sandisk Ultra, but read about all the problems on the XDA forums that people were having and went with the 32. I wish I had a 64 GB capacity to be honest with the rate at which my SGS3's camera can suck up storage, but it's sufficient, and most important, extremely fast and reliable. I've never had an error and never had to format it. Plugged it in and it was ready to go. You get what you pay for.",
"It's the top end besides the stupid expensive Extreme.  It works fine.  I've had 4-5.  I'd get cheaper ones which I suspect are about as good, but slow or fail isn't worth it to me to save a couple bucks.  This just work, and work fast.",
Great card. It has worked very well for me with my GoPro. Great quality and speed. The size is perfect for heavier photographers.,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"On time, so much memory!!!!!!  I used my 32GB on a week vacation and didnt even fill it up.  I'll use this one next, but my 32GB is the same brand, class and speed.",
It was easy to put on and line up.Had a hair in it and had to take it of and re-clean.No problem getting it off and back on again. It did not loose stickiness.NO bubbles is correct.I don't think it helps with the glare.The screen does look a little duller but I still have problems seeing it in daylight.I think it is one of the better screen protectors out there.,
"Note: My original Kindle Oasis review was posted on 4/29/16 on this product page on Amazon: New - Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover. This page is for the same product but for purchasers who wish to use it outside of the U.S. My original review follows.UPDATE 7/24/16: After using my Oasis for almost 3 months, I thought I would add a brief comment to my original review. I have settled on using the Oasis for reading in bed, where it's lighter and easier to hold and I prefer the page turn button style. For my reading elsewhere, for example if I want to read while eating, I use my Voyage w/origami case to hold it upright. I can read the same book using both Kindles since they stay synch'd to one another, and it's given me basically the best of both worlds, at least for my style of reading. The Voyage with cover almost seems clunky - bulkier and heavier - compared to the Oasis, but when it's sitting on a table it hardly matters. I have to say that I'm fortunate in being able to afford both, and the new base model Kindle that I recently picked up is not yet getting much use, even though much of my reading is in lighting conditions where the non-illuminated display works just fine. My original review follows.---------Amazon released the first Kindle in November of 2007. Eight and a half years later, the Oasis model is the 8th generation Kindle and the third evolution of Kindle with built-in illumination. The price of 300+ was a bit of a shock, but I ordered mine as soon as it was announced on April 13th.Read more",
"I used this card to reply a Class 4 on my Fujfiilm X20 and the writing speed is much better now. Before, after shooting a picture in RAW format, highest quality, it took 8 blinks on the LED for the image to be written, with this card the time is 5 blinks. This is a substantial increment in speed.",
Works as expected. Love the great price and use it with my GoPro3. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.,
Good sd card does its good job I purchased mine the 64gb for my note 2 highly recommend it try it,
"This card is fast, fast, fast. it also holds more photos and videos than I have been able to take thus far. However, as the number of such items increases, I can see that I will, relatively soon, be looking for a 128 or 256 gb card. Very satisfied with this purchase.",

"does exactly what I needed it to do for Galaxy S5. Word of Warning...With KitKat it prevents apps from editing, changing, deleting anything on your SD card. Stock Apps that come with the phone can but downloaded ones are not able to. The trick if you have pics movies or whatever is to copy them to the Phones Internal Storage and delete from there. Until they fix it or come up with a non root work around for the Operating System.",
Good bye video camera. Just stick this in your Galaxy Phone and take high def video all day! TONS of storage for an amazing price!,
"I bought the 64GB Ultra card to increase storage on my Acer A500 Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.3 tablet.  It didn't work as Android doesn't support its native exFAT formatting from the factory.  Insert the card into an SD adapter and plug it into a PC or Laptop under real Windows.  Reformat this card to the NTFS format with Windows Format utility and Android can then read and write any size file, even files over 5GB, to and from this card.  You do NOT need to root or modify the Android tablet in any way, except to have ver 4.0.3 operating system on it.  This product is very fast reading and writing and has proven very reliable...a great value in some really serious storage space.",

"I'm writing this review with the benefit of being an experienced Kindle Fire user vs. someone brand new to the Kindle family. In summary, you are getting a great deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding. If you are a first-time large-screen tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration in comparison to more expensive versions, I'd recommend it. If you're comparing last year's HDX model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to last year's Fire HDX but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of previous models of the Fire, setup took a while: despite being a brand new product, the Fire attempted to download and install several operating software updates. You just need to be patient while it downloads and installs.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the best screen display of any previous model of Fire and looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp in a side-by-side comparison to last years HDX version and my iPad Air (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work): I compared the viewing experience watching an episode of The Lost Ship.Read more",
"I am thrilled with the new Fire HD8 - even before it gets Alexa! At that time I will likely be ecstatic! I am far from a tablet novice - I had the original fire the 50 fire the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and the Galaxy Tab S 10.5. My phones have always been Samsung flagship phones, currently the S7 Edge. I say this to show that I 1) have experience with kindle fires, and 2) generally tend to have high standards for my most used devices -- I KNOW what is a good tablet and what is a so-so tablet. Admittedly, my previous fires have been so-so, but I wanted something inexpensive yet adequate to take places with me instead of my Galaxy Tab S 10.5.My HD8 is the 32gb option, with offers. Most users will likely be fine with 16gb and perhaps an added 32gb or 64gb SD card. However, I know how I use my devices, so went with the 32gb option, as well as a 64gb micro SD card. In the 48 hours I have had my new Fire, it has become my device of choice, even over my 500 samsung (more convenient size). I use the large samsung tablet as a computer replacement whereas the new Fire replaces my two 7 inch tablets as the go to device.Before receiving it, I wasn't sure about the low resolution (1280 x 800) on this tab, but honestly, it's not a problem! Sure, it's not bright and beautiful like my Tab S ... but its crisp, clean, and clear. The colors are sufficient, but not vibrant, sadly. (The comparison photo below is the HD8 (2016) and Fire 7 (2015).Sound is quite good, with good volume. The speakers are on the left side when portrait, on top (or bottom) in landscape. I prefer them on top. The sound is good enough that you can enjoy a movie without having to use earphones, unless in a noisy environment, in which case you would likely want to use earphones anyway.Read more",

best best best productreliableown a fewone isnt enoughgood price I guesswill prob buy more at some point,
It's worked great with my Galaxy S4 cell phone. Videos and photos taken with the phone automatically get stored to the memory card after it was installed as do may apps.  No issues.,
"I purchased the SanDisk Ultra 64GB MicoSDXC memory card to put in my Samsung S4. I tried to purchase this memory card locally (AT&T; and BestBuy) but no one had a 64 GB memory card. I am glad that I purchased the memory card as not I can put my backups, music, podcasts, etc... on added storage. I would recommend this memory card for anyone who has a Samsung S4.PCEddie[...]",
"when it did work it worked well, one day it just died 3 months after I bought it. I know these thinks happen with any memory card, it happened to me on another card I had, but that is another story. luckily sandisk has decent customer service, and will send me a new card, they were actually easy to work with, I contacted them through email, hopefully all goes well that ends well",
purchased as a gift but I do have the Echo. If the echo works like the Echo it will be great.,
Who can't use more storage? 32gb is enough to store a whole lot of music! I got it for my wife's phone. I put over a dozen albums on it and didn't even use a third of the space,
"This microSD card works as advertised.  My Samsung Galaxy S3 developed a problem with the SD card that was included with the purchase of the phone.  Once I replaced it, it's as good as new.",
"I never know what to write on these types of items...SanDisk is a name brand, I have never had a problem with any of their products.It works great in my I-Kam Extreme video glasses and the data transfers easily to my desktop pc.",
"I didn't format the card 1st and it cost me my video. Don't do what I did; format the card then use it (Windows PC) I'm not sure if you have to format 1st when using MAC. I used a PNY SDHC 16gb card and it did just as good as the SanDisk and it cost about $15 less, I think that's the better way to go, you're getting the same results just not as long of video time.",
"From what I've read, some Galaxy users have had problems with MicroSD cards, but this one works great so far; lots of apps are willing to store their data on it, and Samsung's built-in camera is able to put its photos there instead of in the system memory, so it helps free up a lot of space for apps and things that have to be in the system memory. I've put all my MP3s on the card as well and they play back perfectly using both the Samsung music app and Google Music.",
Gave my galaxy S4 plenty of memory and at a good price. I had a problem with my first one but Amazon sent me a replacement next day which worked perfectly.  I would recommend this to anybody.,
What you buy this for is in there. 32 gb fast writing speed etc. happy with product. no issues yet,
"I purchased 2 of these and am very happy with both. Good transfer rates. I found my last SD card caused the camera in my phone to delay when taking shots, but this one allows my phone to take pic's very quickly! :)",
Perfect.Get the 32gb.,

"I am using the Fiio X5 and my current 64 GB SD card is full. My library is now bigger than 150 GB and this Sandisk 128 GB card had a price drop to $100 and with free shipping, it was a no-brainer to get it to accommodate all my music files. It worked as advertised and speed can be further improved but then I am limited by the read speed of my player X5. Overall, a good product with the big memory space which filled my needs. Recommended to buy again if there is a discounted price for this card. Else get 2 x 64 GB card, which is still cheaper than a 128 GB SD card.",
"I picked this up to slam into my s3 phone & it works greatif you are thinking about it for that just order it.If you have an s3, 64 gig is the largest card it will support",

Changes the whole look of the Echo ... after i purchased i think i should have gone with the tan leather. But blue is my favorite color and it adds a bit of a pop to a mundane looking black disk! The texture is also really nice feel and look to it!,
"Does not work.  I have a card purchased at Best Buy that looks identical side by side.  BUT!  Transferring music onto the Best Buy purchased card was extremely fast.  100+ meg albums transferred in 2 to 3 seconds.  On these cards, a 61 meg album was at 18 minutes remaining with less than a quarter of the album transferred.  I bought two, so I figured maybe a bad card.  Tried the other, same thing.  Extremely slow.  Wonder if they are even real.",
BEST PRICE DEAL FOR ME GETTING A GOOD NAME BRAND.  HAVE NOT ACTUALLY USED THE STORAGE TO DATE.  GLAD TO HAVE THE STORAGE.,
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
"no matter the product SanDisk is always a prime choice. I've ordered so many of these for all of my devices and recommend these to all my friends. For me personally, I own 5 or so:2 for phone 1 for movies and 1 for everything else1 for go pro cam1 for 24mp camera1 for game cameraall no problems",
"It's a memory card. It holds info. 62Gigs. Can't say more. Lower cost would be good, but it works just as it should.",
I have used these Sandisk Ultra Micro SDHC 16 GB cards exclusively since buying POV cameras that  require them. I have used them in Gopro Hero 3 and Sony Action Cameras.These cards are great.,
Great with the galaxy s3 didnt have to do anything special just transfer any file fast and got it going must have for s3 phones.verizon S3,
"I bought this for a Note 3, but I am still waiting for Verizon to ship. Meanwhile it works great with my Note 2.",
"Loaded up my mp3 collection in no time for use in my phone, came with SD adapter and in very small packaging, almost nothing to throw away! Card has worked great in my phone so far, no lag on video or audio. Good deal @ 30usd",
"I bought one of the 32GB for my Galaxy S4, and another for my Canon T3i. It works no problem in it, detected and formatted out of the box.  SanDisk is one of the most reliable card manufacturers in my opinion. I've gone through and sold a lot of cheap/lesser SD cards throughout the years, and almost all manufacturer has their failures, but to date I haven't had any issues with SanDisk. I've bought this same card for my wife and family members (everyone has the S4), and so far there's been no issues. I use mine heavily everyday, new music and movies, and after 6-9 months haven't had any failures.As far as speed goes, using `dd` on a USB3 card reader I recorded almost 14MB/s write speed and 33MB/s read speed. Making it by far the fastest Class 10 card I've had. They do sell &#34;Extreme&#34; versions of this card which are even faster, but most integrated devices won't see the speed increase benefits.",
"All of them quit working. There's absolutely no way to revive them once that battery loses power If NOT charged immediately, if even just a few weeks go by, NO HOPE of ever using your Kindle again. A major flaw",
"I made sure to get the one in the retail packaging when ordering. It arrived next day from Amazon. I tore open the packaging and inserted the card directly into my Note 10.1. The card was picked up right away, no formatting needed. I will say, I had updated my unit to 4.1.2 first so I am unsure if the update is what made the recognition so easy. Already crammed it half full with movies and music. Plays all of them smooth with no lag or speed issues whatsoever. I think I will get another.",
Upgraded from 32GB to 64GB card for my Galaxy Note phone.  Looks like it works fine and has full capacity.  Good product.,
"After having my first ever failure of a SD card, a 32GB SanDisk Micro SD card that went from apparently fine to totally corrupted in a matter of minutes, and before I could salvage anything on it. With the refund from Amazon of the 32 GB card I purchased this 64GB Ultra card as the replacement for my phone.After having problems getting the full 64 GB seen as an individual 64 GB and not a partitioned into two 32 GB files on the card, and the secret is to NOT format the card in a computer, format the card IN THE PHONE, then via USB or WiFi you can add back all the content,It is seemingly working great, seems fast with no undo lag when taking burst mode photos and I just hope it will continue to do so. I am much more contentious about backing up though, with Android, Amazon and Google pretty much all your content can be saved online and reinstalled but it takes time and is a big hassle so just backing up to a computer works great for the next 'just in case' time.",
"Review updated September 17, 2015As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing this review from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the 2013, 2014 and new 2015 Paperwhite, the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9. This review is for the 2015 All-New Kindle Paperwhite. The attached picture shows the 2014 Kindle on the left and the new 2015 Kindle on the right. Here is the summary of my initial impressions of the 2015 model versus the 2014 model.I am somewhat disappointed in the 2015 version as there is not a huge improvement over last years model. The Paperwhite made many improvements from its original first generation 2012 model to its second generation 2013 model, especially in the display and processor area. The 2013 model came with 2 GB storage, a wonderful display, a great battery and was the e-book workhorse. The second generation 2014 model changed by only increasing storage to 4 GB. The third generation 2015 model increased the display resolution but reduced the battery life slightly.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: A Paperwhite device, a quick-start guide and a short USB cord. Amazon still does not supply a power adapter.SIZE: Its the same identical size as the older Paperwhites. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.3 to 7.2 ounces, a fraction of an ounce, most likely because of a smaller battery.The good news is that all cases that fit the other Paperwhites will fit the 2015 version!!DISPLAY: The resolution has been bumped up to 300 ppi, equivalent to the Voyage.Read more",
"great value for money, works as advertised.  it is a sd card what else is there to say.  but this makes me write words",
This is big and fast for me. I prefer having this side so I wont run out of space and the speed of 32+/- is all I need anyways.  Highly recommend it.,
"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more",

"Pro:  Small, fast, and priced OK.  This is basically a class 10 card; file access is noticeably faster than a class 4 I was using before.Con:  not really noticed anything.",
best bargan on the market. good size for a good price so what more can you want it works and wont break as it seems,
"Fits in my new Samsung Note 3.  Holds lots of music and data.  I like Sandisk as a brand and this is no exception.  Oh, did I mention I bought a second one for my son too.",
Very reasonably priced for a product that works very well. I have never had any problems with SanDisk products so I highly recommend it to everyone.,
This is awesome addition to the stationary Echo. I can take this out in the yard or garage when working outside. Great sound and long battery,

"I got the micro sdcard 64gig, I reformated to fat32 and works very well on my galaxy s2 i9100 with no problems at all, thanks:DEDIT: After 7 months of using this memory card, now i tried to format it but it wouldn't, i tried about 5 different methods and none of them worked, i wouldn't recommend buying this one: SanDisk Ultra 64GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS Memory Card Speed Up To 30MB/s With Adapter, Frustration-Free Packaging - SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-A. Avoid buying it or you will experience problems in half a year.",
"Let me start by saying I purchased this item from my local Best Buy store for the same price here on Amazon (plus tax) but I feel that more people read Amazon reviews so I wanted to leave my review here. Now, I didn't expect this to be an amazing tablet, but people were generally saying it was snappy enough. I wanted a media tablet. Something I could use late at night to watch YouTube videos or an episode of my favorite show while laying in bed. I also like it for online shopping so I don't have to hold a laptop but am not looking at my phone screen.PROS:Tablet exceeded my expectations. It's great for media. I use this more than my phone and my laptop now.It's snappy, I was able to complete my homework for online classes, watch videos from CNN and other tasks without too much struggleIt can be a general purpose tablet. HEED MY WARNING doing the following may void your warranty with Amazon, I'm not sure. But I installed the Google play store on my fire HD 8 and now have access to a huge selection of apps. I decided to do this after finding there was no good YouTube app from Amazon's app store. Because fire OS is basically Android with a heavy skin on it, everything runs perfectly as you can see from the pictures.SOUND IS FANTASTIC!!!! Did I say that loud enough Yes they are still tablet speakers, no they won't fill your whole room with bumping bass but MY GOSH these are some GOOD tablet speakers. Better than my 900 smartphone, 1000 laptop and 500 iPad. What I'm trying to say is, the speakers are way better than the price point would suggest. Bravo Amazon.CONS:Ram is lacking. Doesn't excel in multitasking, drops tasks while you're away even if it was the last thing you were doing. It does this randomly however, and it's not always a problem.Read more",
I like buying things that work as advertised. This does.Although it does not respond as well to my wife's commands. Hmmm...,
"I couldn't find this cheaper anywhere else, for the price you simply can't get anything better. Write VERY fast, and has plenty of storage. Using this in my BlackBerry Q-10.Very recommended!",
Got this memory card for a good deal. I'm using this on my samsung galaxy s4. So far I never filled up the memory card and still have at least half of free space on this card.,
Nice case that my daughter needed for her new kindle she earned. Nice and sturdy. Its actually better than I thought it would be and serves its purpose.,
"Bought 2 of these for the wife's & my Android phone. When her's failed after 2 months, we figured it was just luck of the draw. Now mine failed after just over 4 months, losing a bunch of photos & videos (I made sure to back up every few weeks but even so, we just lost a bunch of photos of our 2 month newborn).Clearly SanDisk had a bad batch with this lot and as the return policy is horrible, I won't be buying any more SanDisk, no matter how cheap (when we bought them on sale around January 2013 they were over half the price of similar SD cards; again, SanDisk clearly knew they had a bad batch, shame on them for dumping them on the customer, no matter how cheap).While I would presumed they would have solved the problem in production, buy at your own risk, SanDisk will sell product with ridiculous failure rate.EDIT: After submitting my review I did some more research on other sites and the low star reviews here. SanDisk is so clearly guilty of selling a defective product from the batch about 6 months ago. Which as I said before, is when they put them on a super discount sale. They knew what they were doing and they are thumbing their nose at customers who just fell outside warrantee (like myself).To knowingly sell your customer something that is going to fail at an unacceptable rate and then ignore them because it failed a little bit outside warrantee is just bad faith. I beg people considering buying this product to not do so, and thumb up the reviews warning of failures. It is only when companies lose sales do they reconsider not screwing their customers like this.Personally I have bought several SanDisk thumb drives, CompactFlash cards, and a Sandisk MP3 player. The thumb drives were ok but I wouldn't buy another mp3 player from them (it was buggy as hell). Up until now I had an overall neutral to favorable opinion of them, not anymore.If you think I am overreacting, please just skim through a few pages submitted in springtime of 2013. There is at least one or more ""6 months and it failed"" reviews per page.",
"Good price, travels well, has a lot of good features, compact, user friendly.",
works great does what it says it will do. price has come down over the years and quality has improved. I use it in my note 3 and it does a great job. when I fill it up I put everything on an external hard drive and the card can be used over and over and over again.,
Got this to replace my old class 4 micro sd card in my new phone. Plenty of space and very fast.,
"Just got mine right now. Looks the same as the previous generation except for the Kindle logo (it's black this time), feels a little heavier, the screen is a little warmer toned than the previous one, BUT the resolution is SO MUCH BETTER! The 300 ppi are definitely obvious and the new font is worth the money.Totally recommend it for a book lover!I'll give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I am used to a cooler screen, but I'm sure I'll get used to this one soon too :)",
"i like it, good product next time i will order the bigger memory. i will recomend this product to my friends",
"Seems to be fast. I use it in a Galaxy note for media storage, and it seems to move files as well as any USB stick.",
Disappointed that the Acer netbook could not read the 32GB microSDHC using  included adaptor but the memory card functions perfectly in Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus Android telephone.  Moved large video files very quickly.,
Very fast memory card. Excellent price here on Amazon as well. It still amazes me that this little fingernail sized memory card can hold 1600x more data then the hard drive of my first computer. Highly recommended.,
"Recieved this fast, copied over all my stuff which took very little time and now I have plenty of space and speed.",
"Fast card, reliable performance.  Got this card for my Galaxy S3, no compatibility issues.  Would buy again for in a heart beat.",
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
"What I like is it its sound, it's portable and I use it at work. The sound fills the whole office.",

"I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S3 to expand the memory. Best money I could have spent. No issues, works as it should. Fast shipping, great packaging. Worth every penny.",
Fast shipping. Good packaging. Fast speed card. Does what its supposed to do. Sandisk is a well known brand and I use many of there products. Currently using in a Lenovo yoga 10.,
"It's good, I liked it, works perfectly with my Minidrive, but it's kind of slow, sometimes it doesn't reach the promised 10MB/s.",
"LOVE OUR NEW ECHO! I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them echolettes LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request.Read more",
"I bought this to use as expanded storage in my Asus Transformer Book T100 but it was unstable and I have had to return it. Although the tablet would see the card when it was first inserted there would be errors trying to copy files onto it and then Windows would indicate that it needed formatting. If I tried a quick format then everything seemed to be OK but the instability would return as soon as I tried to copy data to the card. If I tried a full format it always failed.I gave it two starts because it seemed to work using the supplied SD adapter in a Windows 7 laptop. I was able to do a full format on that but, when I put it back into the tablet, the problems continued. The tablet is compatible with SDXC cards and, when I tried a different micro SD card in the tablet, it worked fine so I assume it was a problem with this card.",
"The Amazon Tap puts out an impressive amount of sound for such a small device. A few things to note if you're not familiar with the Tap or haven't seen it in person:- It's roughly the size of a glass of water- By default, you do have to press the microphone button to talk to Alexa, but as of an update released on Feb 17th, 2017 there is an option in the Alexa app to make the Tap always listen without pushing the button (at the expense of battery life)- The speaker grille is not metal, though it looks like it in pictures. It's a mesh fabric, similar to what you'd feel on the end of some speaker grilles and micrphones. It's firm and comfortable to hold, but if you push hard enough it does flex. - Using a sling or other case will most likely not allow you to use the charging dock, as there is very little room between the tap and the dock for any kind of case.- You can charge the Tap using either the included dock or by plugging any micro USB cable (one is included) into the back of the speaker.",
What can I say? It's a memory card! Bought for my BlackBerry Z10 some months back. OEM quality. The price was right. Arrived in retail packaging. I recommend this seller and this product.,
"Use it as my windows file history drive. It is fairly fast, easy to use and durable. I've also used it as a normal SD card with the included adapter.",
"I got this to use in my Acer Iconia W510-1422. When I went to format it it only shows it as a 27GB. I put it in one of my other computers to double check. YUP oddly 27GB. Fluke? Miss representing? Did I get a bad unit? Not going to return because packaging is gone and not interested in paying for the return. It works, it is fast, no issues, but only 27GB.",
I'm using this card in a phone and so far I have no complaints. Access to the card by the camera and other applications seems fast enough.,
The kids love it. They ask it silly questions which to my amazement it has an answer. I really like for the music aspect. Just tell it a song and it finds it,
"My Samsung Galaxy Note 2 came with 8 gigs of internal memory. I discovered that apps can only be written to the internal 8 gigs of memory so I didn't want to fill up the internal memory with pictures, videos, music, etc.  I purchased the 64 GB San Disk Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 card. I found a video on youtube to learn how to insert the card since I could find nothing on it in the phone's user guide.  It's real easy. Turn the Note phone off. Remove the Note's back plate. You see a plaque saying SD card in the upper left quadrant of the phone. Simply place the microsd card face up with the metallic pins facing down and towards the right into the depressed slot area to the left of the SD card plaque. Then slowly and gently slide the microsd card under the plaque until it clicks. If it isn't in correctly, it will tend to move back out from under the plaque. Do not force. Replace the back plate on the phone. Turn the phone on.  Go to settings, storage.  At the bottom of the page, you will see SD Card.  If the microsd card was inserted correctly, you will see the additional GBs of storage displayed there.  You will also see Reformat SD card and Remove SD card.  Use these settings to erase data from the microsd card, and to remove it from the phone.  Do not try to remove the microsd card from the phone without first activating the Remove SD Card setting.  You can damage the card and the phone.  The card came quickly and San Disk is a reliable brand. It's great to have the Class 10 rating too.",
it works as intended.  don't notice the difference from other memory cards. (only typing this to meet minimum words required),
"Just spent a few hours with my FireTV, and am quite impressed. Setup is incredibly easy, the voice commands work amazingly well, and everything loads quickly. The lack of storage is a major issue if you are planning on using it for gaming. Only 5.6 GB's of space is usable, which can be filled quite quickly by games that push past 1GB a piece.On the plus side wired xbox 360 controllers workAlso, this would be a great device for someone who is not tech savvy. There is a really nice instructional animation that loads the first time you power on the device, and the voice commands make finding content VERY easy.For parents: There are parental controls, and an option to block all in-app purchases. This is a godsend if you have kids.EDIT: There are dozens of reviews from people who don't even have a FireTV. Look for the verified purchase logo on reviews. If it doesn't appear ignore that review as they don't have any experience with the device.",
Looking for a radio for the kitchen this works great the more you use it the smarter it gets,
Needed extra disk space in my surface pro 1. Put in this item and have had no problems since. Very good performance - similar to my SSD hard drive.,
"Well, it's a SanDisk. Never had an issue with one and this one was no exception. Good product. Good price.",
Got this product and it was fine until it just stopped working...The last one I had that came with my DROID X on release day worked for the whole time since I got it without a hitch...I get this one and it's dead in less than 60 days...I don't know if I got a lemon myself or the whole supply is bad or faulty... All I have to say is I am very displeased!,
very nice,
"Well, it is pretty much as advertised. Good speeds. I think it formatted somewhere around 62 gigs.This was a great buy.",
"I had a kindle keyboard. I still have. I'm not sure I'm ready to part with it. I'm rather attached. The kindle is *the* e-reader. It's fantastic. I had my kindle keyboard for a couple years and I couldn't imagine reading on anything else. There were times I left my kindle at work and had to read on my ipad. I hated it. However I found the keyboard interface to be cumbersome and just old. I wanted something new. So onto the paperwhite.Mine was a gift. I have the wifi only version. Why would you need the 3G Just download several books at once and you are good to go. I will say that the paperwhite light is fantastic. Have you watched the videos on the paperwhite. It's not a traditional backlight. It does not shine the light towards your eyes, but rather down at the screen. GENIUS!!!! I sit at a computer all day. I do not want more light shining at my eyes. Which is why I loved my kindle keyboard for so long. I haven't had the paperwhite very long, but I keep it at about a medium brightness so far. I love that I can now read in bed with no other light. The paperwhite is light weight. It's rather small, but about the same width as the kindle keyboard. I put both kindles on the same page of a book and more lines were rendered on the paperwhite than the keyboard. But the font isn't smaller. Somehow more words are fit on the page. I like the touchscreen interface. I really found the keyboard keys to be tedious. I kind of sort of miss the page flip buttons though. I loved those. Since they were on both sides of the kindle, they were easily accessible no matter what I was doing at the time or how I was laying. IMO the jury is still out on whether or not I can live without those buttons. So far I'm doing ok, but I will confess to missing them greatly.Read more",
"Of late, Sandisk appears to have lost their way a little with their flash storage products. It's almost a universal truth that all of their USB flash drives are hopelessly slow; while they're usually reliable, transfer rates of 4MB/sec or less are worthless when filling a 32GB drive. Fortunately, their ""Ultra"" line of SD cards still appears to buck this trend.Formatted as NTFS and used in anelago Mobile Nano II reader, I see write speeds on a 64-bit Linux machine at a consistent 15-16MB/sec when copying large (1GB or larger) files to this card, which more than lives up to its class 10 billing. Reads appear to run at about 19-20MB/sec.I can't comment on reliability as I've only had the card a few days, but everything I've copied so far for testing has made it onto the card (and off again) with no corruption whatsoever; the MD5 checksum of every file I've transferred matches the source. That's more than can be said for the Supertalent Pico USB drive that this SD card and reader are intended to replace, which has never been quite right (it's always occasionally randomly corrupted files of larger than 100MB or so, and the probability of 1GB or greater files surviving was near zero).32GB appears to be the sweet spot at the moment; smaller cards don't cost that much less, and larger cards are beyond the SDHC spec and into SDXC territory, which isn't yet universal in terms of device compatibility (not to mention they cost far more than double for 64GB).For what I paid for this around Thanksgiving (not part of any explicit sale, but definitely a lower price than appears usual as far as camelcamelcamel is concerned) I'm extremely satisfied.Edit: I should also mention that the included mechanical full-size SD adaptor is one of the worst I've ever encountered. There's a lot of friction when the microSD card is inserted, and it's a right bugger to get it out of the adaptor again. Thankfully I have a few other such adaptors lying around should I ever need one; this one's going in the bin.",
Bought this over a month ago and it still works great. been using it in my gopro 3+ snowboarding taking some heavy falls and have had zero issues!,
Great product with enough capacity and it delivers performance. I am happy with this product on my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone.,
"Installed in my Samsung Galaxy S4 (AT&T) for music, photos and video storage.  Works perfectly, never had a glitch in 6 months. (Formated as exFAT)",
"I purchased this Micro SD card to add storage to my Acer tablet. Unfortunately the tablet did not recognize the device. After uninstalling the card several times I decided to use it in my Samsung phone and it works fine there.If you are going to buy this product for a tablet, I recommend you do you research and make sure it's compatible.",
"Great card, great price...can't really beat SanDisk. The brand has never let me down and is well built.  I use this on a Mobius Action Camera and it works wonders.  It also has worked well on my GoPro Hero3+ Silver.",
looking for a good memory card then this is it. Its fast and it works flaw less with my Samsung tab 3,
MicroSCHC works as expected and have not had any issue whatsoever.  Excellent way to upgrade memory on your mobile device.Highly Recommended.,
I bought this for my phone because the apps I was using were filling up the little space on the phone I had.  I had never changed out the card on a phone before but it was surprisingly easy and now I have tons of room for all my photos and apps and stuff.,
Pleased with all the features. Amazon did another fantastic job with bringing great sound inna small package.,
"Item came as described:  YesItem was priced well:  YesI'm using the microSD as an external which is always plugged into my mac.  Helps me store a bunch of files for school, and as a back up.",
The only thing I have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device. Why is that?,
perfect just as described,
"I bought this to because I wanted to upload music to the disk for my off the computer listening, this does not support music files so I have no need for this. I've tried hooking it up with the Flash card it came with, I've tried putting it in my phone and hooking my  phone to the computer, I've tried through my mp3 player...nothing. I can't even get Windows Media to recognize the flashcard. If you're looking for more storage for portable music don't buy this.",
"I've had the new Fire HD 8 with the case for about a week. I use it exclusively for reading and listening to audiobooks. So far my only issue with the tablet is the volume drops when the cover is closed. Why is that There is no reason I can think of why my volume needs should change because I closed the lid. BTW, the marine blue is lovely. The speakers are located along the left side of the device so when you close the table case the sound quality which is already mediocre, is noticeably diminished. This is a design flaw that needs to be fixed. I purchased this tablet to replace an impaired ipad mini. For the price, the Fire tablet is a reasonable replacement.",
This is my first Ultra Micro SD Card.  I like the color which makes them easy to see because I swap them out all the time in my ASUS tablet.  The black ones can be hard to see on the busy desk.  The speed is great but that is not why I bought it.  I was very impressed with the price on Black Friday 2013.,
"I use this on my Galaxy S3 and Sony Action Cam, and it works perfectly, never had any issues with it and i find that for any action cam this is a pretty solid sorage ammount.",
"great price especially for the size and speed, this maxed out my Note 2 smartphone and I am very pleased with the speed of delivery and the cost.",
MicroSDXC is the wave of future storage for any manufacturer that has any sense. These little cars can increase the storage capacity of the most basic of devices for far less than buying more expensive models that don't allow external storage. Easy to use and with an industry standard that expands up to 2TB in capacity.,
"I bought this to be able to load more music into my Verizon LG Android phone. I spent hours adding music to the card. Then, I put it into my Android phone. The phone did not read anything on the memory card. The other memory cards, 8GB and 32GB worked fine, so it must be a flaw in this memory card. Also, this memory card got stuck in my Android phone's slot. I had to use a utility knife with a very, very thin blade to pull out this card.",
I got this for my new Android tablet and it works perfectly. The MicroSD to SD adapter is great. It allows me to plug it into my computer into the regular sized SD card port to transfer files much quicker than if I were to plug the tablet into my computer over USB.,
No complaints about this card. It's much faster than what came with my Android devices and of course the capacity is nice. I have not experienced any issues indicating any defect.,
"It is a great addition to a smart phone with huge capacity to store data. Also it is pretty fast to record video, no lag at all during recording.",
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function.

"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me.

The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",

"A powerful new streaming box that challenges the competitionPros:-- Sleek, thin, good looking and powerful hardware - fastest box available currently-- Good video and sound output (HDMI, Optical Audio out)-- Fast, responsive UI and streaming - good hardware/firmware, ASAP feature works well-- Nice remote with novel Voice Search feature (works very well)-- Gaming controller and internal GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)-- Games are fun on the Fire TV, graphics are surprisingly good-- Decent array of apps at launch, tons of content available-- Quiet, cool operation, super easy set-up and easy to use-- Good support for local networked content via Plex Media Server and apps-- Potentially great gaming with some good titles available now (Asphalt 8, Riptide GP2, Sev Zero)Cons:-- No SD card slot or other local storage expansion-- USB port not functional Some reports say a USB keyboard will work, have not tried it yet.-- Voice Search only for Amazon content currently-- Some apps (HBOGO, RDIO, etc.) not yet available-- No HDMI or Audio cables included-- No easy way to search free Prime Video content only (mixed in with pay to view)-- Could use a head-phone jack and/or std. audio out as well as opticalWith a 1.7 GHz quad-core CPU, 2 GB of RAM, a GPU and 8 GB internal storage, the Fire TV represents a big leap forward in power for a streaming set-top box. Add in dual-band wifi, ethernet, and Bluetooth support as well as a USB 2.0 port (not useful at present), HDMI, and optical audio out and you have a sleek and capable hardware unit, though missing a few nice things like an SD-card slot(Amazon wants you to use the cloud or networked storage). The power and memory at hand here promise a fast, smooth user experience and the Fire does seem to deliver that based on my initial use. With these specs, this is the fastest box out there, currently.This is also a box that is somewhat serious about gaming support as it has an internal/onboard GPU and an available controller. Many game developers seem excited about the prospects (and market) this device represents. (Currently, you get a free game and 1000 Amazon coins for each controller you purchase.) *** Update, I have tried several games and they are great fun. Graphics are surprisingly good, controls smooth, really pretty impressive for this type of system. ***With 1080p streaming and Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Surround Sound the picture and sound is great. It runs Android (basically 4.4.2 KitKat) so lots of apps should be available right out of the gate with lots more to follow.Some people are grousing about the 99 price, but I do not feel it is out of line at all, and indeed, it seems like a bargain compared to the competition's hardware capabilities to me. You get a decent amount of performance hardware for your money, so I think it's fine (and I'm sure there will be specials later for those who can wait). I could not wait myself and ordered one immediately. I like the Roku (I own several), but this was too tempting to a geek like me.Clearly, the Fire TV aims to challenge the other contenders such as Apply TV, Roku, and Chromecast. Each has their strengths and weaknesses, but the Fire TV seems like it will appeal to many. You might not be too tempted if you already have a Roku 3, but if you are a resident of the Amazon ecosystem, you may find the Fire a great asset. Those new to the game will find it worthy of consideration.There are still a few rough edges as with any new product, but none that seem too significant to me. Most will probably be addressed in short order, but the main thing is that there's plenty out of the box that Amazon got right and the Fire delivers a great experience. Set-up is very easy and straight-forward.The Bluetooth remote is a nice touch, for example, and the voice search is promising. While it currently seems limited to Amazon content, hopefully this will expand at some point. Even so, it's fun to use.Streaming seems to be smooth and glitch free in my tests so far(mostly with Amazon Prime Instant and Netflix). I will do more testing and update this review as I learn more. Load times are generally very fast, sometimes almost instantaneous, and the Fire TV is quite responsive. Video quality is very good.The menu is decent enough, similar to Roku and others. It is a bit Amazon-centric as you might expect. Hopefully future updates will allow one to customize it a bit more. But simple and sweet is what most people want and that's what you get here. Your Amazon video library and watch lists are available, of course.A lot of my favorites like Prime Instant, Netflix, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and so on are here. (Rdio is missing and I hope it gets added soon.) I'm sure all the main ones will get on board, it's just too big a market to ignore.I have not had time to set-up Plex yet, but that promises to be a great feature for sharing photos, music, and videos from other devices, including a PC, laptop, or tablet. I have Plex in the past and it generally worked very well. I will be very interested to see how it goes with the Fire TV (and will update here).Amazon seems to have taken particular care to address the buffering issues sometimes experienced with devices of this type and I have not seen any such issues, so far, at all. NiceMore to come as I have more time and experience with this device. Giving it a solid 4 stars for now pending further time with it. I really like the Fire TV and likely will upgrade to 5 stars if no glitches turn up. *** Upgraded to 5 stars *** Everything working well, gaming is a lot of fun, gfx better than expected. Everything loads faster than any other system I have used (Sony, Netgear, Roku, etc.). Everything looks great. I feel like the value is there, especially if you are already in the Amazon ecosystem. (But non-Amazon stuff like the Netflix app also work well.)I hooked my Amazon Fire TV up my Epson projector and gamed big and it was a blast. Prime Instant Vids and Netflix looked great as well. The fast, responsive interface and overall snappy performance make for a great experience.Gaming:I got RipTide GP2 for the Amazon Fire TV. Still waiting for my game controller, so played using only the Fire TV remote, but even so it was a lot of fun (especially big screen using my projector). Reminds me of PlayStation games (a good thing). The graphics are darn good, better than I expected, and the game is a lot of fun and fairly easy to pickup and play. The game controls work well, even using just the remote. This is the first game I've tried on the Fire TV and I was very surprised and pleased with the quality. Definitely worth a try if you like racing games.*** Update - got my controller - works well - Asphalt 8, Riptide GP2, and Sev Zero all look great and play great. Very impressive I think the Fire TV is going to surprise a lot of people in the area of gaming. ***Tip: In Parental Controls, you can set up a PIN (or use your existing one) and enable pin protected purchasing so that a PIN is required for any purchase made via the Fire TV. Although meant primarily to prevent kids from purchasing without a parent's approval, it's can also serve to prevent accidental 'one-click' purchases of your own.-----Note: If you're interested in more details, you can find PDF's of the User Guide, Quick Start, Controller Manuals and so on here: www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.htmlnodeId201348270",

"I bought this to stash all (the ones I would watch on the go) the movies and songs that I previously owned to my new Galaxy S4. I am extremely impressed with how fast the device works outside of the phone and inside when used by the phone. It is dramatically slow when the phone with the sd card in it is wired up to the computer via usb, but that is really unrelated and the process isnt painstaking. Fast and huge in capacity, definitely a must for enthusiasts.NOTE: As of ICS, Android has stopped allowing the movement of apps into the sd card. So if youre planning on installing games onto the card, you will need to have a rooted phone. The card is very useful for other things (music and video, and ROMS if youre interested) even then.",
Like a previous reviewer mentioned it is fabric over hard plastic it is not a snug or tight fit. Good quality though.,
"This review is for the SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A) that was purchased for me from Amazon.FRUSTRATING in a word. This card was reported by two different Android phones as damaged but my Windows computer recognized it with no issues. If the card had nothing on it or had just been reformatted then the phones recognized it but as soon as data, music or pictures were added then the phones reported the card as damaged. I had this card returned to Amazon after 3 days of sheer frustration.I read another review that suggested the Class 10 cards were not ideal for smart phones. I was already using a Sandisk Class 4 16GB card in another phone and had never had issues so I purchased a Class 4 Sandisk 32GB and it was as smooth as butter. Both phones recognized the card right away and added data, music and pictures seamlessly and quickly. The second card purchased was the SanDisk microSDHC 32GB Flash Memory Card, Black, SDSDQM-032G-B35 (Retail Packaging).In summary this card may work just fine for other devices but based on the sheer number of other reviewers (here on Amazon and elsewhere on the internet) that had similar issues with smartphones I cannot recommend this card for a smartphone.",
What can one say about San Disk other than it works and keeps working.  Works well with or without adaptor.,
"This item works exactly as advertised!  Those negative reviews for this product must be from people who mistakenly reviewed the wrong product or don't know what they have.  This SanDisk Ultra 32Gb SDHC micro SD card is truly a class 10, and works fine in my HTC phone!",
This does not lock in perfectly into a Surface 2. It locks in but you have to force it. Other than that it gives you about 59gb once installed.,
Works in all my sd devices. I bought this one for my smart phone. plug and play! works great. Would definitely recommend this card and the seller to my friends.,
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
installed this big baby in my S4 lay night and it is rocking and a rolling did first test think I got 26mb read which I am plenty happy with I was moving things onto the card also I think so not sure how much faster it can go computer I am sure it will be faster,
"I bought this Sandisk 16GB Class 10 to use with my HTC Inspire, after 3 months, I am getting constant error saying SD Card unmounted unexpectedly.Then today, the dang fkang card won't even read in the card reader, I have 10GB worth of videos and pictures, memories that I will never be able to get back. I am very upset.",
"The Nexus One is listed as supporting a maximum of 32GB on an SDCard.Based on  reports here and elsewhere, I took out my 32GB card and put in this 64GB card and powered up the phone.The phone reported that the card was defective in a notification.I pulled down the notifications and tapped the notification that issued that report.  It offered to format the card.I would note that I have Clockwork Recovery and the ROM Manager app installed on my rooted (CM7, Android 2.3) N1.After tapping the notification, the phone formatted the card.  All went well.  Since I had neglected to move my RootExplorer file manager off the SD card prior to putting in the new card, I was not able to check directly on the phonethat the entire 64GB was available.  But, as it turned out, it was.While doing the above, I had been using Winzip to make a copy of the contents of my 32GB card to my PC (using a USB adapter).  When that completed,I powered down the phone and put the new 64GB card in the PC using the Micro SD adapter that came with that card and a USB adapter for that adapter.It showed about 60GB (the usual for a 64GB card, I guess).Interestingly, some files (mainly folders) related to clockworkmod had been placed on the SD card during formatting, which shows where the formatting codeprobably came from.  Take note: if you do *not* have ROM Manager / Clockworkmod on your phone, your mileage may very well vary.  If you have root, I would suggest obtainingROM Manager from Google Play prior to doing the above.  Anyway, I just deleted those files so that they wouldn't conflict with any of the old files I was aboutto copy.I then unzipped the saved contents of my old card onto the new card.Then, I put the new card in the N1 and powered it up.  It worked perfectly, right away.Root Explorer showed about 60GB of capacity (of which about 30 was used by me - I really needed this card!).Tried out Spotify Premium and it played fine from saved files that had been on the old card and were now transferred to the new card.  Other thanRoot Explorer, haven't tried any other apps yet, but am expecting good news based on the experience thus far!I tried a full backup using ROM Manager and it apparently worked without incident.So, based on the above, I would recommend this card for the Nexus One!  What a break to get another 30 GB on an aging phonethat is nonetheless still one of the best phones ever.Caveat: Keep in mind that I just unwrapped this thing and have used it for all of two hours.",
Great Product. Works perfectly with my Canon Camcorder. Very responsive and fast.Enough capacity for 8 hours video and great price. Grabbed in thanksgiving 2012.,
There were no issues with this card and my Galaxy S4. 29.71 GB usable space (as was expected). Price was right too.,
"I got this card only a few months ago, used it on a Note 3, now it has failed. No matter what I try, attempts to format the drive or edit the files on it, whether using my computer or the phone, have all failed. The card's data is now essentially read-only, which is the only saving grace of this since I could at least save my data.Previous to this I had an issue with it corrupting photos randomly, with increasing regularity as it grew closer to complete failure. I am now going to be avoiding SanDisk when possible",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
I love this speaker it works wonderfully. Very recommend,
The card works with a Galaxy Note 2.  Install was simple.There are some minor drawbacks I was unaware of when using card storage on my phone.I do notice an initial lag when first accessing the card.Transferring existing items onto card storage is not that simple.Not all items can be moved to card storage.,
"The case does what it is supposed to do. I think because I bought the tablet, Amazon should have reduced the price of case. Too pricey but I wanted a perfectly fitted case and not something that would or would not be compatible.",
This is my second one and it is great! It can be used as a remote also. It was easy to pair with my Fire TV. I received my first one when I purchased the Gaming Edition of Fire TV and I liked it so much that I bought a second one for my son. He is a gamer and he was very happy with it.I would recommend this product for anyone who is a gamer. There are many more games available for the Fire TV and they play flawlessly on the Fire TV,
"I purchased this card for use in my helmet mounted video camera. All memory cards are NOT the same and as correctly stated by a previous reviewer even cards rated the same Class number don't perform the same. This card performs well in sub-zero temperatures when catching ski-ing action and also high speed flying action in Southern CA in very high temperatures in a black camera. I did not measure the actual data speed, but it captured 1080p HD 30fps video from my camera without any issues.Overall this card is good value, performs well and I would recommend it.",
"I've tried other cards going back to when Compact Flash cards ruled and every single time I wind up coming back to SanDisk.  Why, because they won't certify a card at a certain speed unless it can sustain that speed and every single SanDisk product I've ever owned has lasted, and lasted, and lasted.  I have QUIT using SanDisk products because it just didn't make sense to keep using them (256mb and 512mb thumbdrives and flash cards... they still work... REALLY slowly... but they still work fine... but what the heck do you use them for?) but the only times I have ever had a SanDisk fail I could trace the failure back to something other than a fault in the SanDisk product soooo... I buy SanDisk because I ALWAYS get my money's worth.",
"I really like these SanDisk Ultra microSDHC Class 10 cards.  I have several and when I see huge price drops I pick them up for phones, cameras, GPS' as well as tablets, on which I store video files for traveling.  I've never had a problem with a SanDisk.",
"Just great, I hadn't been problems with my memory and I use it with my S3 all the time, so its great.",
"I bought 4 of these units (yes, at Amazon):  SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-032G-U46A for 3 Samsung Galaxy SIII and one Samsung Note 2, and found that one in the SGIII has stopped working. I tried everything, in a computer, in different adapters - dead is dead. Since the other three are used by non-techno people, I am not sure if they are still working or not.When I contacted SanDisk, they gave me test instructions, which of course all failed the tests. To return, I have to pay for shipping that MUST BE tracked. This will cost around $20 for a $26 item. I ignored this, and shipped with a regular mail. I should not expect anything back, but who knows.For $6 more I have another unit, and I can tell you it will not be a SanDisk Ultra. Oh, well, the average price for the 3 remaining units will then be $34 (33% more than the purchase price).If I get a replacement, I will update this message.Update:I got an e-mail from SanDisk to advise me that they did receive the item and it is being processed. Shipping without tracking cost me $0.65 vs. $20. At least I have to give their customer service (or return department?) credit for being honest. Too bad the memory cards have problems, as SanDisk had an excellent name for providing good quality products. Maybe I should give this another 1/2 star, but there no such thing.",
"gave this to my girlfriend so she can take more pics and save them ono this memo. This thing says it can transfer 30mb/s, the thinig is that it's really fast, it's faster than previous memos i've had.",
"A month and a half after purchase...  My device powered off while the card was in use (batteries ran out).  Since then, doesn't work.  The device doesn't recognize it.  Doesn't respond to recovery, reformatting, partitioning... nothing.  I've used EaseUS, ZAR, HP USB Disk Format, and a couple others.  No dice.  Nothing can read it or fix it.",
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me.

The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
Actually fits and holds data vs others brands which didn't work consistently. probably overkill in terms of size for most uses and requires special USB reader,

"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",

"Bought this for my GoPro Hero 3 and am happy with the storage capacity. When formatted it gives me about 9 hours and 20 minutes of 720p video at 60fps.It's high capacity storage, it transfers quickly enough and was reasonably priced. What more can I say?",
This memory is the right price and it worked right from the start.I think this is a good deal and good memory.Works fine in Note 2,
"Perfect match for my OTG device and Moto G. Solid speed in transfer and play. Holds all my music and video, leaving storage for apps on my phone.",
Perfect and just what I needed for my GoPro camera.  It also comes with an adapter car which can be handy.,
Very satisfied with the speed and the space on this little guy.NOTE: you need to format this on a Cellphone that can be capable of using micro sd xc or on a card reader that is compatible with sd xc because if you do not do that you will only see it as a 32gb. (i got a couple of errors because i had formatted first on a computer with a SD HC reader NOT XC. But now it is working fine.,
This works great for added memory on my new Asus T100 tablet/laptop.  It came with a 64gb hard drive and now with this I have 128gb.,
I have used and tested this memory card on GoPro Hero3 Black Edition and everything works great. No problem at all.,

"Worked as advertized, loads fast.  Only problem was pulling it out of the adapter after Loading it on my computer.",
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes. Normally you pay 150-400+ extra for features that are found in these 100 boxes. I have not found a smart tv that is decent and is also a good value for what you are getting. The advantage is that you can use your TV remote to access the content. (and that is about it)HTPC: These are desktop computers or Mac Minis or Android Sticks that you load software on to stream video to your TV. These can add content that no normal streaming box can access, without giving up quality but they are only recommended for something comfortable with technology that doesn't mind fixing the issues that come up from time to time.Video Game Consoles: Xbox/Playstations can access some of the content that streaming boxes do and have plenty of power to deliver the streams. The downside is the cost (unless you already have one) and the interfaces. These consoles are not designed to stream video exclusively so the interfaces are decent but can be clunky.(You can use other options but frankly they aren't worth the hassle for the amount of hair pulling you would do.)Now this Amazon product has changed everything. It might not be the box for you...but honestly there is a good chance that it SHOULD BE. This is a brand new category for Amazon and they got a lot right, but there are a few shortcomings (at least at launch) as well so read all of this to see what those are.Amazon's Fire TV boxPros:+ Nothing else is this fast. While Roku 3 impressed the world, this raises the bar dramatically. With a quad core processor and 4 times the memory of any other streaming product, it speeds through menus, boots quicker, starts videos quicker and honestly has the muscle to not struggle with higher end resolutions and surround sound like other boxes can do at times. The best way I can explain it, you will have extra hours at the end of the year because this box is THAT much faster.+ Voice search is amazing. It really works. Less using a four directional keypad to enter in titles is a real time saver and makes you wonder why this wasn't done before but it is only for Amazon content and VEVO (music videos) (at least for now). You can not use the voice search with Netflix for example.+ Ready for gaming, well at least once you spend another 40. The 40 gaming controller feels a bit pricy for this type of gaming and really should be 25 or less in my opinion. That being said, this box has real games you would actually want to play instead of a VERY limited selection on Roku 3 but it is not a REAL console at 100 and honestly shouldn't be compared to them.+ Better image quality I know you are thinking I am imagining things or have changed my setup but both myself and my wife have noticed that generally (in different apps) the video is slightly sharper and clearer. We are using the exact same tv, settings, even the same HDMI cable that we used with the Roku 3 until we switched it for the Fire TV box. We have noticed that especially on poor quality feeds that the image quality is noticeably better than under the same feeds with Roku 3. Now I don't know if there is better graphic chips or if the bigger processor can do more tweaking while streaming but it seems to be something. As image quality is a huge deal for most folks (and normally us streamers have to suffer with decent quality) this is certainly worth noting. So far we have noticed this under Netflix, VEVO and Plex.Cons:- It lacks soul. Yes, soul. The Fire TV box and remote are built like a dvd player or appliance--cold, fast, efficient. Unlike Roku 3 where the box seems to have a bit of the personally of TiVo--it feels warmer, more inviting. Everything about this box is business like, including the interface and the lack of options to change it.- The interface is more than merely cold. It is simply less flashy/pretty than the Roku 3 interface. While fast, I am less tempted to wander around like I do on Roku 3. It seems like they are being pretty dependent on the voice search function which is great but it leaves you missing out on the random items you find along the way with the Roku 3 interface. I will update this more upon extended use.- The voice search only works for Amazon's own content (and VEVO) and not most 3rd party channels like Netflix.- The remote is not ready for gaming use, compared to the Roku 3 remote with gaming buttons when you turn the remote sideways and more sensors for detecting movements/motion.- Another feature about the remote I don't care for is the use of Bluetooth instead of WIFI. Roku used to use Bluetooth on their former high end box but instead replaced it with wifi to increase battery life and to add the headphone jack in the remote. It will likely take a few weeks of use to report battery life but this has me concerned.- No headphone jack function like Roku 3. Now to be honest, if you use that on the Roku 3 it can be a battery drain but it is a cool feature.- Missing some popular channels at launch. There is no HBO-Go, no M-Go and no Vudu. In addition, the channel count is much less than Roku's at launch.- Channels operate differently on FireTV than the do on Roku 3. See my notes below for more information.Overall:This Fire TV box took so much from other company's products with only a few missing items. They focused on delivering smooth, fast performance with less frills than Roku 3 for the same price. While there are missing channels and features, the biggest failure for me PERSONALLY is the cost of the gaming controller. Without it, this box isn't ready for gaming but adding 40 more for the ability to try out the functionality seems pretty steep. Had Amazon included it with every Fire TV box, they would have sold a lot more games and had everyone calling the Roku 3 a poor value.If you do not have any streaming box yet, I would HIGHLY recommend this box over every other product on the market right now. I don't make this endorsement lightly. I currently own 3 Roku 3 boxes because I liked them so much, until I used this Fire TV box. This box means Roku will have to really work on improving their product for Roku 4 or they will lose the high end market. (An update, my wife officially asked to replace the Roku 3 boxes with more Fire TV boxes tonight. Yes, these things are that good folks)If you have a Roku 3 box, really look at the missing channels and features--are they something you could give up for faster performance (Also look at my notes on the features of the various common apps.) If the answer is yes, then grab one of these and try it. If no, wait to see if Amazon adds features/channels. At the very least, consider an Fire TV box for your next box.I do not personally recommend Apple TV as they are still too slow and lack too many features and functions. Apple keeps promising something amazing but delivering minor improvements.If you are on a budget and have an Android based tablet, consider Chromecast. It is a good value for the price but you do give up features and content to save on the cost compared to Roku 3 Fire TV.I am giving this box a 4.8 rating, compared to a 4.2 for Roku 3.I will update this review regularly for a while, so check back for more information Also if you have questions or comments, please feel free to ask them in the comments section. Either myself or other helpful people will do our best to respond to them.UPDATE 1:Based on comments, I wanted to add a few points.Regarding comments that I received the item free or are paid by Amazon to write this review, etc.I paid the full list price and local sales tax for this box (grrr). Nothing was provided to me nor was I paid anything to write about this device. I do not work for Amazon, I own my own company. For this item, I am just a customer. In fact, I didn't expect to even purchase a Fire TV prior to it being announced because I figured it would only deal with Amazon's own content which I feel is much weaker than Netflix. In fact, I have talked two different family members into getting Netflix over Amazon's Prime Streaming service in the past month alone.HBO Go:This has been repeated over and over in the comments but HBO Go support for me is not something I am interested in as I do not have cable service anymore nor do I feel that HBO is a better value than Netflix. I would not go without Netflix support at all but I personally think HBO Go is more niche for many people and honestly I bet this device will get that channel before too long. Clearly the HBO Go people seem to be pushing the issue but I know 11 streaming box users and none use HBO Go so while I noted the missing feature above, people still seem to want to beat me up over it.UPDATE 2:CHANNELS:It needs to be said that some channels require cable/satellite subscriptions (to those channels) like HBO Go (not currently on this box), Showtime, ESPN, etc. Even if you have HBO, it does not mean that your provider allows the HBO Go, so look into that before purchasing any box with that in mind. I do like the Bloomberg TV (not available on Roku 3) App which actually features a LIVE TV feature.NETFLIX APP: Is the older style with the tall covers (like VHS boxes) instead of the new Netflix interface that uses short wide covers (like on Roku 3). Netflix has said they are moving everything to the new software but the Fire TV box doesn't have it yet. That makes comparing performance harder from Roku 3 to Fire TV. On my ISP provider Comcast (Netflix recently agreed to pay Comcast so they have faster streams to customers) I do not see a HUGE improvement in performance in buffing like you see on other channels. What it does seem to do is start in better quality and/or speed the improvement in quality. My guess is that the Netflix app needs to be tweaked to maximize the performance of this hardware. One positive with the FireTV app is that it plays the entire TV episode BEFORE switching to a small window with the countdown starting for the next episode. I can't tell you how many times I had to click, click, click and click just to see the end of an episode under Roku 3.Also, the FireTV Netflix app has two features that were removed from the updated Roku app. Before going into a TV show, FireTV tells you how many total episodes that Netflix has. On the Roku it shows you the number of seasons instead. I personally prefer the number of episodes but clearly that is a personal preference. Another point worth mentioning is that the FireTV Netflix App shows you how many items you have in your list and what item number you are on. That information is missing from the Roku 3 Netflix app.AMAZON PRIME CONTENT: Does not loop--a feature they should add (and likely will). This means once you get to the end, it just stops instead of keeping going.VOICE SEARCH:Voice search DOES cover some 3rd party content, despite everyone reporting it works on Amazon's content only. I have repeated confirmed it supports the VEVO app and will find music videos in that app. That may mean that other 3rd party apps are covered as well, or certainly might be able to be in the future. If you search for something that has PRIME content and VEVO content, it will default to the option with the most options. To switch to the other, simply arrow up and either left or right to see the music videos or PRIME search results.OPTICAL OUT:I noticed this box featured an optical out port but normally run everything through my LG TV (via HDMI) and then use an optical out to my receiver (so I never have to change the receiver's settings) so I wasn't excited about this addition to the Fire TV box over my Roku 3 boxes. I stand corrected. I decided to run my audio via the optical cable into the receiver directly from this Fire TV box (something that I can not do with Roku 3) and it fixed all random lip-sync issues I have from time to time on the Roku 3 box (and the same with the HDMI output on this box).Now I know this is not a typical setup for many people but I do know that tons of people have lip-sync issues with HDMI connections so being able to bypass the HDMI minefield is much more important than I expected.VEVO APP:This app works better than the Roku 3 app performance wise...one quick example is that some content simply fails on the Roku 3 app--try watching Britney Spears's Work B**CH (don't make fun of me). Vevo can play this video fine on YouTube and on the Fire TV app but struggles on Roku 3's app. SOME of VEVO's content is also available via VOICE SEARCH too.REMOTE:I do miss the jump back button on the remote that Roku 3 features. It is a tiny thing but it once you are used to jumping back to see that painting in the background or catch that line that you didn't hear because the phone rang, or someone was talking, you feel lost without it. UPDATE They did include this feature but hid it abit. You simply double click the reward button to skip back. I haven't seen anyone else mention this tip so you saw it here first peopleI do like that the enter button is back in the center of the directional keys. This is the way it used to be on Roku boxes before someone at Roku decided to move it below the directional keys, so you have to move your thumb oddly to press it.MULTITASKING:What multitasking you ask Since you haven't seen this advertised or mentioned elsewhere, I can understand your confusion but try this: Load a Pandora stream...then click on the HOME button and browse for movies/tv you want to watch. As long as you are in the Home/Amazon Prime content, you can browse WHILE Pandora continues playing. Now Pandora dies when you enter another APP like Netflix but it shows you that Multitasking is built into the operating system and may be utilized in future features. (Again, this TIP is only found here)Another update: This tip also works when browsing PLEX content before you play something. So even when utilizing a 3rd party app, it can keep going. When it changes to a new song, a small window pops up on the lower right hand side of the screen to tell you know the new song title and artist.PLEX APP:Compared to the Roku app, PLEX for FireTV is totally different. There are some cool features, like the backgrounds, the screensaver using your photos and the MUCH faster menuing (night and day from Roku 3) but I do miss the channels not requiring a couple clicks to switch to ONLINE to see. I do miss that clicking the play button doesn't play a clip, instead you select it (click) and then play it (second click).SCREENSAVER:FireTV has a screensaver that is honestly pretty cool in my opinion. I am not saying you can't do this with other boxes but no other box comes set up to display random photos (and includes a decent amount of beautiful photos as well.) This functionality covers 3rd party apps like Netflix and Plex too so you have a seamless slideshow no matter what you are using when it starts. This is the sort of thing you see on PCs not streaming boxes and it is a nice touch.GAME CHANGING:Many commenters have argued that this device is not gaming changing and many have rating my review not helpful because of that title.I said Nothing else is this fast to which one commenter said, Nobody cares how fast an streaming box is. That's not a game changerActually using it you will see what I mean. This is the first time a company has put so much into creating a very solidly made hardware device. Like a fast computer (which this basically is), it will depend on software that is written for it to fully show off its abilities.When AMD created their first processor that competed directly with Intel's higher end processors, it was a game changer, correct, because it changed the landscape of personal computers forever, lowered pricing, etc.People will look back in 5 years at this moment and say Amazon's FireTV changed how consumer streaming video boxes were made (instead of barely enough processing power to stream, they became able to compete with HTPCs and Mac Minis). This is the beginning of a new generation of streaming boxes.I said Voice search is amazing. and they said Not unique, by any means. My xbox, ps3, tablets, all have this, and all work amazingly.Find one person who owns this that doesn't say this voice search works better than anything from Google, Apple or Microsoft. The fact that little old Amazon could out deliver those tech giants is SHOCKING. The fact this works via a tiny remote makes it very easy to get use to. There is no other product in this price range that does this and no other streaming box even offers it at any cost.I said Ready for gaming, well at least once you spend another 40 to which they said: And stick to basic android games. No thanks. I have a REAL console (or a couple of them) that can play REAL games...This isn't meant to compete with more expensive game consoles. It is meant to bring gaming to streaming boxes, just like tablets/cellphones have brought gaming to millions. They have not replaced gaming consoles (and likely never will) just like this box will not have you ditch your gaming console either but instead it opens you up to tons of games you CAN'T play on that same console. Just imagine all the cheap under 5/free games you can enjoy on your FireTV box. As I said above in my main review, I think Amazon really should have thrown in the controller to really get peopling playing the games but I can understand why they needed to limit their losses.Again, this is a best in class hardware device with real gaming and the best voice search on any tech device (and the only one for a streaming video box). Every future streaming box will be measured against this one. Tell me how that isn't game changingPlease understand that everyone has different priorities and requirements so no one box is going to be perfect for everyone. I am attempting to do my best to address most of the many options and provide a decently balanced opinion of them.Hopefully this review has been helpful to you.

"IMPORTANT UPDATE (3/8/17): As you read my original review, please be aware that Amazon announced in early February (2017) a new firmware update that allows Amazon Tap owners to enable a hands-free option! By going into Settings in the Alexa app, you can now choose the hands-free option and have your Tap respond to voice commands without touching it, just like the Echo and Echo Dot! This is a fabulous development and something Tap owners have been hoping for. Thank you, Amazon!Since the lack of hands-free operation was the one major shortcoming of the Tap, this wonderful little device has now gotten a whole lot better. One thing to keep in mind, though, especially if you use your Tap on battery power: The hands-free mode will drain the battery more quickly, because it requires the microphone to be on at all times. But since you can easily toggle between hands-free or regular tap mode using the Alexa app, you can pick and choose how you want to use your Tap for maximum battery life and convenience.-------------------------I admit that I was a little skeptical when Amazon first introduced its Echo device. But I decided to buy one anyway, thinking that if I didn't like it I could easily sell it. After all, back in the early days of the Echo it was in very high demand. So the financial risk associated with trying it was minimal. Today, as an avid music listener who loves to cook, I'm thrilled that I decided to give the Echo a try.I had wanted a device that I could stream music with in the kitchen, and the Echos hands-free voice control made it very appealing. But how would it sound That question was quickly answered as soon as I set up and started using my Echo.Read more",
"We use these for our Samsung Galaxy 4s phones and they are amazing because I can now take a gazillion pictures! I only wish that I could separate the pictures on the memory card into folders but that is a Samsung issue, not the memory card issue.",
"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Update 7/21/2014:The latest software upgrade as significantly improved the device for Amazon Prime members - addressing most of my original complaints.Now that there is an entire section dedicated to Prime content, it is much easier to find things without having to wade through pay to view content. I wouldn't mind seeing more 'categories' to search through, but don't want to diminish the improvement.It's still not possible to search and return only Prime content. I think it should be possible to tell the device (when you search) that you only want returns from what is available for free to Prime members.The new 'Music' option looks intriguing but seems to have no purpose at this point. Not sure why it was added, but I hope it grows into a useful feature given the new Prime Music package.I would also like to see some sort of DLNA feature added. As one who rips all content that I buy (blu rays, dvds, cds) to a computer on my Network, I would very much like to be able to stream this material to the FireTV. Adding support for a connected USB device is not a solution for me. I have no intention of keeping two copies of all this material. Read more",
Got this 32GB card for my Droid Razr Maxx HD.  It was recognized by the phone and I have had no troubles with it. Shipping was only a couple of days.,
"Once I figured out the S3 wasn't liking the exfat file structure and formatted to fat32 it works quite well. I don't know if it's the phone or card and I'm not about to test it elsewhere, but I didn't see the 30MB/s speeds. It works good enough for the phone and it's the best option I have for the biggest storage for now.1080P videos with no issues. No problems with read/write stability. Overall I'm happy I bought it.",
I used it in my Droid Razr Maxx HD and it kept unmounting itself.  Then it became unresponsive and all my data was lost.  Now it isn't recognized by my phone or my laptop.  Dead in the water.,
Popped them In our Phones and they worked as expected.,
"I bought it for my grand daughters camera, but when my 64gb memory refused to work with my Windows tablet, I swapped them and this one is working splendidly.",
No problem here. I use it in my Samsung Note 10.1. It is a little slow writing to it but such are micro SD cards.,
Overall good memory card. It is fast and it even comes with an adapter. Fits in my camera perfectly and picture taking has been a breeze. would recommmend to others.,
"I can't say enough about the Amazon Tap. I enjoy playing music from it and that it's portable. I can play music from my Amazon prime account, Pandora or from my phone. It is fun to ask Alexa questions. Yes, Alexa cannot answer all my questions or find everything I ask for, but it is still amazing.",
"Got this to use with my GoPro, give 2 hours of recording time, once II figured out how to use the camera.",
"Using it on a Canon 6D. No camplains at all. Really fast access. The adapter itself is not at same level, even though. Bad connection, had to use a previous adapter that I already had.",
"Added space for movies, games, books, pictures, and music. Also great to relive the carrier's stock S4 for space. All major US carriers only supported the 16GB version of the S4",
It works as describe on the box. I didn't research a lot but I did read about it a little.,
I was better off with my 32gig card.  This thing was nothing but problems.  The phone does not see it half the time and it is SLOW.  The phone keeps asking to Re- format it.  I got it to see the card after a reboot.  It is still SLOW.I will be buying the Samsung 64gig card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 1.  I have seen good things from Samsung.,
"As the title says, the card I got is defective and faulty. The issue is, the sd card always unmounts and then remounts and sometimes it will says the the sd card is corrupted and needs to be formatted, so first I tried to format it using my cellphone (xperia play) copied all my files again to the sd card and it gave me the same error tried 2 other phones (inspire 3g and Samsung Galaxy S4) still same error, then I tried to take it out and put it in my computer and manually format AND check for bad sectors and fix errors and it will not finish and says &#34;cannot continue because sd card is corrupted&#34;.  I searched google and find out the Sandisk have shipped a bad Batch of Sd cards, so i contacted the company and demanded for a return because its past due to return it through amazon, got RMA'ed and already shipped it and I do not know how long will it take to for them to send me another sd card. So now I do now have any sd card to put my files because of this situations that could've avoided if Sandisk's QA Department is not slacking off. Very disappointed customer.",
"It's hard for me to evaluate this product in detail, but I can report that it works just in my Samsung Galaxy S5. I turned the phone off (probably much better to insert/remove cards with the phone turned off) and then slid the card into the slot inside the back of the phone. When I turned the phone back on, there was no obvious indication that I had made any changes at all. However, when I started to take photos, the camera reported that it would now be storing pictures on the card instead of the phone's internal flash memory. So everything seems to work well.",
I get the occasional dropped frames when using it to record HD video in HD camera. Solid for the 1 couple of weeks. Time will tell.,
Bought one for each cellphone. Will never have to worry about download space for pictures or apps or anything else.,
"Realistically I probably could have gotten away with a 16GB card, but like anything, it's better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. Popped it into my moblie phone an put all my music on it, plus enough room for photos or videos, etc.No hiccups or errors yet and holds a ton of stuff.",
Good quality memory card. Have used it with the GoPro Hero 3 and works flawlessly. Wished all electronics were this simple,
faster memory i use in note 3 and i dont have problem its faster to transfer information and 64 really gb,
I've read a lot of reviews about this not working with the S3. I have had this for 6 months now and no issues yet.,
"This is a fantastic little speaker with the power of Amazon Alexa. I use it to stream Spotify, Pandora andESPN Radio. Small speaker fills the Garage like a concert hall. Battery last 8 hrs and the charging stand could not be simpler to use.",
The SanDisk Ultra 32 Gb microSDHC memory card is a good value for the money.  It doubles the memory of my new Samsung Galaxy S3 and there is no perceptible delay between access to the card and built-in memory.,
"Plugged it into my Samsung Galaxy II, and the memory appeared - what more can I say other than it has performed exactly as expected.",
Great quality product. Purchased for GoPro Hero 3 and works great with the adapter. Would recommend to anyone buying a camera with micro SD.,
Love it but Way to expensive,
"delivery was on time, Works perfect with my Galaxy Note 2. great customer service. Thanks for the product.Able to store all my music and movies on my phone now.",
Used primarily as a portable hard-drive (content back-up and file transfers).  Working well for this application.I have this attached to a small key-chain USB adapter and really like the compact nature of the microSD card,
"I already had a SanDisk 16GB Class 4 card in my Android phone. Here is how you know this is faster: I'd press the Play button for the music player with the Class 4 and there was always a small delay before the music played. With this 32GB SanDisk Ultra, the music plays immediately. This is a very useful way to tell how fast this is. This memory card gets my Approval and my Thanks to SanDisk!",
My fiance has had this in his tablet for almost a year now without a single issue. I feel that it's one of the best quality memory cards we've ever had. Make SURE you get the retail packaging and not the &#34;frustration-free.&#34; The retail packaging only requires one quick clip of the scissors and it's worth it to get one that is sealed in a package and not at risk to be damaged.,
I used this to take pictures. It works good. I think it works just as good as any other memory card I have ever used.,
"So I got this SD specifically for my GoPro Black 3+, simply hoping it would work since the GoPro manual says &#34;use cards up to 64gb&#34; and the SanDisk says it's good for cell phones and tablets, yet doesn't mention the GoPro.Well, turns out it works perfect! And although I haven't tried it on other devices, I think if it works flawlessly on the GoPro, it will work even better on anything else...So at first I thought maybe since it's only 30mbps there may be frame rate issues with recording (even though I knew that shouldn't be the case). Well after popping it in, the GoPro says 9hr14min (1080p super view video) which is insane. I put it on my helmet and took it for a spin. When I came home after spending the day on the bike, the HD quality was spectacular (granted it's all thanks to the camera itself), but it was smooth, with zero frame rate issues. The only flaw is the semi long time it takes to copy files to your hard drive as it copies at only 30mbps, but honestly that's really no big deal and totally worth it still.Bottom line, this SD plus the GoPro 3+ is the best camera combination for your money.P.S. It's small, simple, durable, and has no lock feature (which I always found to be an annoyance anyway).Any questions please feel free to comment, and I will do my best to answer.",
"This is the second one of these chips that I received.  The first either had a latent physical defect or damage in transit, but it snapped in half on first use.  I was really bummed, but determined to try again.  This was a breeze!  The chip blazes, doubled the capacity of the 32 GB chip it replaced in my ASUS TF700T tablet, and holds ALL of my music and documents with plenty of room left over!  I now have 128 GB available on my tablet, and it all works flawlessly.Anyone that is looking to upgrade needs to do a little due diligence in determining that your device is able to address 64 GB's, but with that reservation, I strongly recommend this little gem!!",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"Was excited to get this product for its sheer portability alone (doesn't need to be plugged into an electrical outlet all the time like we have to do with our Echo Dot), but was pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and volume! We prefer this over our outdoor bluetooth speaker, and its ""Hands-Free"" mode is a great updated feature (though we try not to keep it on that setting too long because it does drain the battery faster)...",
"Use it on my tablet, and in an adapter for a usb flash drive on my pc.  So far, it's stored movies, audio, books, pdf's, etc.  Very happy with it.  Will be looking for a 64 soon.",
"I purchased this to put into my Samsung Galaxy Blaze, mainly to store music.  I previously owned an Adata 32GB card which died after a couple weeks.The most annoying thing about large storage is copying files to it, especially when the card is slow.  A class 4 would take well over 2 hours to fill up, while this one takes just a bit over 45 minutes.Using the Antutu benchmark suite, this card clocked in at 11.1MB/s write and 21.7MB/s read.I didn't have to format it or anything, just popped it out of the packaging and threw it right into the sd slot of my phone.",
"works great, it's the real deal (not a fake, as one often finds on some websites) - great in the galaxy tablet, and with an adapter, slots easily into my computer.",
Just what I needed for my new TAB 4. I have absolutely ZERO issues with it in my Samsung TAB.,
I love using this as a speaker for my MacBook. I keep it in my office and use it daily!,
Already many reviews on the product so i just wanted to say i have a few of them and these cards are just plain solid and priced right as well. Hope to see the 128 gb soon.,
"Update on Dec 23 2013 - Please scroll to the very end of this review for 2 month use update. ...For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model. The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080). This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution. The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.Read more",
Works perfectly well in my Samsung Galaxy S4 without having to format to do any configuration. A WORD OF WARNING ABOUT THE ADAPTER IT COMES WITH. THE MICRO CARD IS A VERY TIGHT FIT AND CAN BE ARDUOUS IN REMOVING THE MICRO CARD FROM THE ADAPTER!,
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
"I am updating my review from two months ago.. My initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. Today I have been using the Tap and sling daily for over the last two months and I felt like I needed to modify my review. I originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, I am changing my recommendation.The truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. I have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. I think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. Also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.I initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as I thought it would be. I just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.My only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. I am increasing my stars by one. Really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. I have come to really like the sling. I have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. That has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.My original is below. Overall, I would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the Tap.Received the Tap and the Sling cover in the last 24 hours.Read more",
"I just called Sandisk and they say they have a new card version that corrects the problem. 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)Sandisk Tech says that the new package will show that the card is made after March, 2013 (don't know if that includes March, but probably does), and it should be corrected. Some older than late 2012 reportedly are ok.  Who knows.They even say that they will provide a free UPS return label.Of course, you are taking a risk as to whether the problem is really fixed, so keep backups.  I don't know what I would do.",
"more like 8mb/s in my Note 10.1 and that's using SanDisk's own app. A bit faster in my Note II, but still a disappointment for devices with quad core processors. Not sure if it's the card or the device, so benefit of the doubt and four stars.",
"I bought a class 10 Samsung and returned it after I found out the speed was actually lower than that class. After buying and using many different brands, I have found that this company makes the fastest, highest quality, memory cards. Other companies advertise their cards as being certain classes but they are not up to par. I think $19.99 is a steal; best buy sells this product for $39.99. (As of 7-11-12)The card I recieved must have been a dud. It is broken and my phones are not able to read it. When I try to use it in the computer it says the card is damaged.

Nothing interesting to write. It works just fine and holds a lot of info for such a little card. Thanks.,
"This is a fun and convenient toy, but I'm surprised about some of the limitations. I keep hearing the same NPR news clip when I ask for news or headline news. I would like more news highlights. When I ask for 80s music, Echo starts with the same 1 of 3 songs each time.",
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
Sandisk finally admits that defective micro sd cards cause battery failure in the galaxy s3. I had  mine about six months before it failed completely. I submitted complaint to sandisk and await their response.,

"I purhased this thinking I was getting an amazing deal.  The price was right, the product was not.  After a few months I am unable to delete or add files, pics or music to this microsd card.  I am only using 28gb of space on it.  I cannot add anything, nor delete anything, it won't even allow me to format it and start fresh.  I am not happy with this product and extremely disappointed.  I use my phone a lot and store music and pictures on my phone for various purposes.  I would recommend buying another 64gb microsd card.  One that is more reliable.",
"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded. I've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that I'd expect any besides possible fading).",
I'm using this 32 GB micro Sandisk Ultra to record 1080P video to a blackbox recorder in my car. I just popped it in and it worked. The adapter that came with it makes it easy to offload video to the macbook. It appears to keep up with 1080p video very well. I've never missed a frame of audio or video. It is constantly overwritten every 3 days with the oldest event and it has not failed yet. Been using it for a couple of months now. Seller mailed it USPS and it arrived in 3 days.,
Not much to say. It works as expected. Recording speed is great with my GoPro Hero3. The SD adapter works gear as well.,

The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
"I have the Amazon dot, which is great. But after purchasing the tap, which was on sale too, I was sold. You can take it any where. And the sound is great!!!",
Excellent,
"never used a micro sd card before, theyre a lot smaller than i thought, smaller than my finger nail. i wrote 150 songs to it from my laptop in about a minute. wrote a 750mb movie in under 3 minutes. glad i bought the class 10 card. the agptek 10"" tablet reads from it instantly with no loading. the mobilemate microsd/usb reader works well with it",
"I will be brief and simple.Errors, errors, errors!What happened to SanDisk?  You need to check your QC unit!Awful product ever from a reputable memory company.Update: I got thisSamsung 32GB 32G Class 10 MicroSD C10 MicroSDHC Flash Memory Card Model MB-MSBGA/KRto replace the sandisk garbage. Replacement works as it should. Same on you SanDisk, you lost one of your long time customer.",
Super cool!,
"I purchased this for my Wandboard Quad.  I loaded the Wandboard provided Android 4.2.2 image and have had zero issues.  As the OS boots and runs from this card, it boots pretty quickly (though not as quickly as if it were booting from eMMC), and runs smoothly once at the Android launcher.",
"I would have gone for the 64gb, but they are still a little pricey. This one works fine for now. I have my entire cd music collection on the one card.",
"If you have a gopro, get a different card, it worked in mine for a while then stopped, turns out the gopro fried it, no fault of gopro but through sandisks error, sandisk will replace it but it can get fried again. I've read up on it and it's a common issue, so if you use this for a gopro, get a samsung or patriot or something else to be on the safe side.",
"UPDATE 6/18/14: Well, I suppose nothing lasts forever. After almost a year, the card has gone bad. I use the card a lot in my smartphone - a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S3 (SGH-T999). All my photos, voice recordings, and downloads go on this card, and the downloads are transferred to my computer almost daily via USB cable. A few days ago, a video file I transferred to my computer refused to play correctly. No video, and the audio was skipping and squealing, which I recognize as the sound of a corrupted file. I thought maybe the transfer didn't complete; tried it again, same result. I tried to play the file right on the phone, and it didn't play on my phone! I knew there was a problem. I tried copying the video to my phone storage and playing it there, still no luck. Then I deleted the video and decided to download it directly to my phone, not the SD card - EUREKA. It played perfectly.I formatted the SDXC card twice - once from the phone and once through Windows - and tried the same test. Downloaded video file to the card, then to the phone. Same result both times - it wouldn't play on the SD card, but it did on the phone. All videos used to play perfectly on the SD card. Finally, I swapped out the card for my older, Sandisk Ultra 32GB Micro SDXC card. Like magic, it worked perfectly no matter what I played on it. So yeah, the 64GB card is dead. I should note that the card performed flawlessly for nearly a year up until a few days ago.Thankfully, Sandisk Ultra products like this carry an incredible Lifetime warranty - or 10 years for regions that don't recognize ""lifetime""; their Extreme line of cards raise that to 30 years! I've contacted their support for an RMA so I'll update this review as events unfold. If they replace it quickly, I'll bump this back up to 5 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. Sandisk Ultra Micro SD cards have never failed me, and this one's no exception. I used to have a 32gb card. They're fast and reliable and never corrupt data, which is more than can be said for some cheaper brands like PNY (those fail quite often). I can't wait to get the new 128GB model!",
it does what it is supposed to do it fits in my Mom's camera holds lots of pictures easily slides in and out of the slot so far no problems,
"WORKS PERFECT WITH MY SAMSUNG TABLET, VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT, GOOD QUALITY AND AWESOME, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, FAST SHIPMENT, A PLUS",
"Large storage, perfect for tablets (using it on Asus T100, after maxing out 64GB very quickly), but maybe too slow comparing to SSD, as it's the first memory of this kind to reach the microSD format, that's an acceptable tradeoff.",
"No complaints.  Worked in every piece of electronics I've tried them in.  I've run across fake chips online before, but these are high quality at a good price.",
"Thank you very much, I'm very satisfied and pleased with the product I purchased, I recommend this vendor for their reliability, diligence and quality of their products, in my grateful and happy client.OSWALDO ARTIAGA",
1080p 30fps or 720p 30fps or 24fps using the nokia camera app or regular app doesn't work. well it does but unless you want to see stuttering every 6-7 seconds. it freezes up constantly. very glitchy because its slow. got a 9mbs write 44.9mbs read on mine.,
"Very good for information or Photo storage in a small device, I have 2 so far for different computers and is great.",
"The card looks good, works fine, I didn't do too much test with it.My only complaint until now is the package, there's a line marked on the back for you to cut, I cut along the line, and nothing happened, no opening at all, all cardboard glued tightly. so I cut near the card, only to found I cut the supposed plastic card case/storage shell, now I took it out, and no storage case to store. Not a functional problem, but annoying.",
"I use this in my Android Phone, pretty much for MP3's to play in my truck. It certainly doesn't perform like a Class 10 card when writing the files to it but not for me, wasn't that important.",
got for my Cell Phone and this card works nice and fast on my cell phone as well as on my pc to load it.,
"Card works great with my go pro hero , no speed issues at all. It also come with an adapter",
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
"I bought the SanDisk Ultra 64 GB for my new Samsung Galaxy S4. Being that it's the faster type of memory I like to think it reads and writes fast. And I feel like it does, but it's in my phone so who knows. Now for your highend DSLR you'll notice a difference and be very pleased.",
"would get another, works great, having fun with all the options",
"This was a great little memory card for using with my Microsoft Surface Pro tablet.  I'm able to have my music with me at all times, plus a large number of photos.One item to note: this type of memory card may not be suitable for high speed applications (such as with a camera or for storing virtual hard drive type information).  These micro cards are a 5 star if used for their intended purpose.",
"PROsIt copies large files to the card at ~10-12 MB/s and it doesn't choke when slammed with a few hundred little files like pictures and mp3s. It writes 8mp images with a quickness and 1080p 20mbit recording is smooth in my LG Optimus G E970. I waited for these to get to ~this price before ordering, and as usual Amazon Prime is awesome.CONsNot as fast as the gold 16GB SanDisk microSD cards but for 64GB in this form factor, it's faster than I was anticipating.",
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me.

"Huge Video Card. Use it to back-up my netbook computer without a CD/DVD unit. Watch out for fakes. Make sure this is an authentic SanDisk card, There are fakes out there. There's a program that lets you verify yours is an auththentic card. The fake ones are really tiny drives made to look like a 64GB card. This one is authentic.",
Great to have the additional capacity for storage. And the card is fast. Working great and the price was great also!,
I installed this item into my Dell Venue 8 Pro and it has worked just fine at housing my programs.  I'm very happy with this device.,
"With the small 16 G onboard memory in this Tablet, the added 32 makes it pleasurable for textbooks, music and pictures.",
"This does not appear to work with the Samsung Galaxy S3.  It worked for a few weeks, then my phone started giving me ""Unexpected Unmounted SD Card"" error messages.  After a bit of searching, people seem to agree that the S3 and Sandisk micro SD cards do not work together.",
Bought it for my LG L9 Android phone and in the phone it stayed.  Speed is average.  The problem is that it broke within 8 months with all my data in there.,
"I got this item for my dash cam which is in my convertible. The dash cam is recording at all times when I am driving my car so I needed a lot of memory. This card does the job for me and this brand name is fantastic, no problems, and works as it ought to!",
Bought this for my Hero3. It came with a 16GB card. You will get about 1.5 hrs of video on this card. Great price!,
Very good product. I got tired of taking pictures and the memory is not over. So good that I bought another,
"Performs as it is supposed to. 16gb is quite a lot of storage plus my Samsung Galaxy has 15 gb of internal memory for a total of 32 gb. That's plenty enough to store hundreds of hours of music,",
I own MULTIPLE of these cards for my phones and devices and haven't ever had a problem.  Would buy again if I ever needed one for another device.,
This has all the benefits of the Echo for a slightly better price. I also love the portability.,
Love the storage space.  My GS4 only has 16 Gigabytes for storage and fills quickly.  I just store all my media on the memory card now instead of on the internal memory. Transfers go quick thanks to the great write speeds.,
It's amazing! I love how loud it plays the music!!,
"For some reason this card HATES my Galaxy S4. I was running around in circles for a week trying to figure out why my phone would get stuck at the Samsung screen on reboots. Finally I decided to pull the card out, and voila, phone boots up fine again. It's now sitting in the ashtray in my car.",
Super sturdy and easy for little hands to hold.,
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
"I was very excited to add this memory card to my G2 and finally not have to worry about used up memory anymore. This was short lived however as maybe a few months had passed when the memory card refused to write anymore data. I tried formatting it (never could wipe it), using it in a thumb drive reader kwpould not delete data), all to no avail. Luckily the data I had on it was still salvageable.",
"I love this memory card!! I upgraded the memory on my phone from a 2gb stock card to this and, not only are the transfer rates from card to phone and back WAY faster, but the capacity is great!! I've now replaced my iPod with this because I can have all of my music on my phone as well as any games and I don't have to use iTunes to interface, just drag and drop. Oh, and it's waterproof. Like my phone. Just saying.",
"SanDisk continues its legacy with this high-speed microHD card. A definite must for your tablet or smartphone, provided it accepts external memory cards. Then again, why would you buy one that doesn't?",
"has 32gb of storage, does what it is suppose to do and works perfectly fine in my verizon galaxy S4",
"Had no issues inserting this into an HP tablet and adding photos, music, etc to the memory.  Reads/writes quickly.  Great value.",
"Great MicroSD card at a great price, with speed. I can fit about 2-3 days worth of moderate shooting (60 fps at 1080p) on a ski trip with my GroPro on one of these cards.",
YES,
Worked with my Samsung Galaxy S3 perfectly. I finally have the space to take all my current digital content with me when I am on a plane.,
my slr has sd cards that take time for the next click thought this would solve the problem as it says its faster and a way better product but i don't see that happening.,
"not much to say other than plug and play, good quality and fits a lot of video ...good good good",
Love Alexa. We currently have three devices that we use on a daily basis. I use one at work basically for streaming music. Great device. No problems connecting to any of them.,
"Bought 2 of them for each of our new S4 phones and they both work great.  No issues.  Saves pictures to card fast, transferred music from PC to card fast and I can play and view pictures and videos with no problems.",
"I wanted a memory card for my phone so I started looking around online, this is by far one of the best you can get and the price is un-beatable",
what can go wrong? right? it works and fits what else is there - great price and i love the adapter,
I plugged this into my Samsung Galaxy 4 and it works great. When I plug the phone into the pc it is recognized and can easily transfer files. This card is recofnized by the phone and works as it should. I would recommend,
"Tried this out today in one of those 'Memory Stick PRO Duo Dual slot adapters', basically you use two microSD cards in one and then use it for your PSP, or camera, or whatever.  Worked great, two 32 GB cards were just a little cheaper than one of these and I wanted my nephew to upgrade to 128 GB if he wanted.  The adapter didn't say it would work with XC and we were worried that the PSP would have a problem with it but it all worked out great.  He is upgrading to 64 GB from 2 GB, it was a little overwhelming.  He has lots more space now and might get another one of these cards to put in the same adapter.  I'll update this if anything goes wrong.",
It worked for a GoPro so what more to say except I wonder how they can fit 64 gigs on such a small chip. Amazing.,
"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more",
"I love SanDisk storage and got this for my tablet's MicroSD slot -- it works flawlessly and doubled my tablet's storage with no fuss. The performance has been snappy enough for my needs and I can copy things into and off of it very easily.

This microsd card has been working fine in my Android phone for several months.  I have had no problem with speed or data corruption thus far.,
"I purchased the Sandisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC for some extra storage room for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. I was considering the 64 GB, but went with this card because I have the 64GB version on my Galaxy Note 2 phone and I have never come close to needing all that space. Granted, I don't store any music on my phone but I do take a lot of photos/videos and store as many apps on the microSDHC card rather than use the phone's internal memory.For the cost savings of going with the smaller 32GB card, it was a no brainer.The card has worked flawlessly since I installed it on my tablet and have had no problems with it whatsoever. Plus Sandisk is a big name in storage so again, it's a no brainer--- buy it!",

Works as expected.  Based on price and performance this may be a best of breed product.  I have found the SanDisk brand to be dependable.,
"Bought this for a recently acquired GoPro 3. Stuck it in and had no problems. I would recommend these cards looking for a micro SD for any electronics that need them. Great balance between price, performance and reliability.",

Works great, no complaints.",
"So far, so good.  It does what it's supposed to do.  Doesn't seem any faster or slower than any other micro SD card I had.  Bought a cheap imitation on Ebay and regretted it as it crashed.

It's all about the reliability, which you get with this product.10/17 Update:  Big problem with this SD card if you are a Windows Phone user - does not properly record HD video.  Video recording to SD card is consistently choppy.  Pop in another SD card - records fine.  Record to my phone - records fine.  I've tried formatting it every which way and it isn't working well.  Go with another brand Windows Phone users.",
"This works well with my Samsung Galaxy Stratosphere II. It has a lot of storage space, good for all your videos, music, and pictures. It comes with an adapter so if you wanted you could use it in a spot for a regular SD card, but it really is meant for use in a voice or data recorder, a camcorder, or phone. It is class 10 so it handles recording and playback of HD quality video which is important as newer phones can record that way. Very good card",
"Is very stable and when i use this product in my samsung galaxy 7, sometimes the tablet don't recongnize the memory but the problem is maybe the tablet not the memory i think",
"UPDATE:I raised my star rating on this from 1 to 4 because of the customer service.  I was able to get a replacement pretty easily.  Hopefully it will last longer!ORIGINAL REVIEW:This item worked well while it lasted.  I bought it in October 2012 for my tablet pc and then for an android smartphone.  I did not make many transfers to the card, it was mostly reading files from it.  Now it is March 2013 and suddenly the card is no longer recognized in my android phone.  It is no longer recognized on my other devices as well.  I lost many photos and videos on the card because of it.  I'm sure Sandisk will exchange it for a new one, but this shouldn't be happening with a card that is less than a year old.",

All good A+,
"Put most of my music and Many movies on it and tons of room for more. Awesome and well priced, at the time of my purchase anyhow.",
the card arrived promptly in good condition. i don't use exfat so i reformatted it to ntfs but fyi some for example cameras only recognize fat32 so keep that in mind. i have used this for a few months now and have had absolutely no issues. a great value imho.,
"Liked the first one I purchased so much, I bought a second one. Very, very fast read and write speeds at a good price, plus SanDisk has the best software and device compatibility.  Forget thumb drives - this is your most flexible, durable option.  Use direct in your tablet or smart phone and/or buy a decent usb card reader you can load this in and, voila, instant super-speedy, upgradeable thumb drive.  Works great in my tablet and in my newer card reader - and still kicks the butt of every thumb drive I know of even when used with my old plastic USB 2.0 card reader held together with scotch tape, lol.  Have purchased several microSD cards since they first came out, from 2GB to 32GB, and all still work fine - I cannot say the same re the thumb drives I purchased during that same time period.One point - beware of counterfeits.  Samsung is the number one brand so, unfortunately, they get counterfeited a LOT.  So check reviews and only buy from a reliable seller.  I suggest buying direct from Amazon (or Memory Mogul) - I have purchased from both with no issues.",
I bought this for my Samsung galaxy s4. I don't know if it is my phone or the card but my phone says it was unexpectedly removed from time to time. My wife's phone doesn't do it as often but still does it. Very fast but unreliable. I have had many sandisk before and this is the only one I have had problems with. I have read that there were some that were poorly made. Thinking I will send it back and give it another chance.,

I bought this for my Surface Pro 128 GB. So now I have an additional 64 GB which I use for movies and music etc so I don't use up my 128 GB SSD for that stuff. Works great!,
"Without an on / off button, I have found that the controller comes on (the light comes on showing it's connected to the FireTV) even when not in use. I am assuming this is why the batteries were draining so quick. Now, I put the remote into a 2nd room when I am not using it and the batteries last a normal lifespan. The light never turns on know when the remote is in the other room.",
"For the price, you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone. I had to use my daughter's Beats Pill for this function, therefore it's not worth all the hype.",
"This review is for the second generation Kindle Paperwhite. Like all kindle e-readers before it, this is a great product. However, I am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year's model. For this review, I focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new Paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year's model. Also, I found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising, so I will try to clear them up.HARDWAREDesign - The Kindle white has a nice look and shape. It fits well and is easy to hold in one hand. It's fairly light, so it doesn't tire the hands too much. I can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands. Its design is very similar to the previous Paperwhite - almost identical. The height and width are the same, the buttons are in the same location, and although this version is slightly lighter, it is not noticeable.Display - Although not a huge improvement from last year's model, the display is one of the best features of the Paperwhite. Like most e-readers, the Paperwhite uses digital ink technology. This model employs a more advanced version. In addition, the lighting has been upgraded, so among other things, it is more evenly lit. Together, they make for incredible viewing. In my opinion, it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. I really enjoy reading on it, text look very sharp and crisp, with little to no eye strain.Processor - The Paperwhite has an upgraded processor, which means smoother page turns and navigation. I am able to open books, flip pages, and navigate menus fairly quickly. There is barely any lag as I flip through many pages at a time. Also, the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all.Read more",
This card works perfectly in my Black Box Original Quality G1W dash camera.,
Great price and reliable. I got 3 for my various devices and haven't had any issues with them at all. My phone and music player now have an awesome amount of space.,
"I am hoping that I received a defective product and that my experience is rare, but this product did not work as intended. I was replacing another 32G micro sd card thinking that, because this is a Class 10 rated product, it would be faster. It never worked correctly. It kept dismounting unexpectedly, losing data, and was just not worth the money AT ALL! I ended up using my slower rated product which has worked reliably since the day I bought it. I only wish this product had done the same.",
"I've had this card for a couple months now and it is amazing, i use it in my phone so i can put stuff in there rather then use the space on the phone, its extremely responsive and extremely  fast as well, i had a SanDisk class 4 MicroSD card and this flies past that easily, usually when i would try playing music it would take a couple seconds to start, but using this it starts instantaneous , it was as if i had stored the music on the phone itself, i dont know what else you might use this card for, but if you are looking for a MicroSD for your phone, look no further",
Was a little difficult to sync the first time. I really have only used the Tap to play music and to ask for the weather. I like that the device takes up little space in my kitchen.,
"A very cheap way of expanding memory on your 'phone. I have bought this because of the 8 mp camera on my 'phone, which means that memory gets used up quickly. This is also a good quality card. I usually find SanDisk products last at least a year before breaking, and even longer if you keep them in the device.",
"I like how it plays music. It is perfect to connect to smart home products. Such as nest, Belkin , and many others. It is easy to use.",
"The product works well. However, you have to hold down the button to use the best part of the device, Alexa. I really wanted to take it back because it can be a little annoying to hold down the button every time you have a question but the sound quality of this product is just so dog on awesome!!",
This speaker has some kick. The sound quality is great that this little speaker is able to put out,
I am extremely pleased with this case. Though lightweight it is well constructed and crafted in a way so that it protects the Kindle from bumps and bruises and it also will protect the screen if the Kindle happens to fall on its face. This is a great buy and I highly recommend if you want to keep your Kindle safe from harm,
"I'm still learning what all i can do with this device, but I am continually amazed at it's capabilities. I love playing with it and learning from it. When doing other things, I have Tap playing music. I love this thing.",
"Small, portable works as a blue tooth speaker when I take it away from home with me.",
I bought this for my father and he definitely enjoys the extra storage space. Who wouldn't. It came in a timely manner and was easy to install.,
"this chip holds way more than i would normally need but we were going on a three week trip and potentially taking about a million fotos.  if you need a large capacity this card was fast for the writes and reads for all the fotos i took.  the largest fotos were in the 10-12 MB range but most were 5-7 MB.and there were at least 15000 shots, some were absolute crap but that is the great thing about DigiFotos, the film is cheap.i bought mine here for $50.47, and that is STILL a good price i think for the ability to capture so many fotos and videos (and data if you wish).",
It was what i expected.Didn't test his real speed but as price and size and with adaptor from microsd to SD card for me was ok.,
"It's a great product and I am using in my samsung galaxy S4 mobile. GS4 uses for camera store, and the pictures taken are fast.",
Perfect for my Galaxy Note 2 and the price is very good. This memory card does not stall or you do not have to wait for it to load like other cards do.,
Bought this one to add to the standard one i had already purchased for the size and speed and price it was worth it,
I've heard horror stories about other models but this one is good and it really makes life easier and allows for plenty of storage.,
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
"Still going strong after a few months on my HTC phone. Did get disconnected a few times though, not sure if its due to the card or the phone. Hopefully it can last :)",
"I like to keep track of the &#34;Daily Deals&#34; and check them almost daily (resulting in me spending more than I should), but this was too good of a deal to pass up.  I will be upgrading my cell phone soon, so I knew I would be needing it soon.  So, at $30 (with an adaptor and in retail packaging) I jumped at it and am glad I did!",
Great price. My Galaxy S3 recognized it no problem. This replaced my old 16 GB micro sd card. Thank you Amazon!,
I had purchased a used HTC phone... that the kid had taken the original 8meg card out (I did not know it came with one till I reviewed the specs online)Well... that was OK... I would have upgraded anyway - this got here in 2 days because of being a prime member... and fits good - works flawlessly.,
Nice product very helpfully . We believe in this products san disk if we need more we do not hesitate to buy another one.,
This chip is fast & solid.There really isn't too much to say about this kind of memory.  My most appealing aspect is the fact that it has a MUCH faster access speed than many other SD cards.,
I bought this card for use with my Asus Transformer Book T-100TA to add external and removable/replaceable storage capacity.  When inserted into the slot provided it was immediately recognized and the driver installed.  The card appears as available and with the promised storage capacity in the &#34;MY PC&#34; folder of the computer.  I have been able to move files on and off the card as intended.  The product is fine and the price was satisfactory.,
"Using this in my galaxy note 2, works great for movies, music and apps, with no issues what so ever.",
"Works as expected, no problems, second time I purchased this item, happy with purchase. Cheapest price I found for Sandisk.",
Already bought this one last may but you can't beat the new price. Original Sandisk products never failed me before. Just be careful where to buy.,
does what it suppose to do....works great works well. good price. would buy another. good storage for any digital file.,
"Speaker is really cool. Sounds great, easy to use. Love the fact that it is portable. Only downside I see from the more expensive model is you have to tap the button (not always listening)",
Unable to read.It says it's blank.It then prompts to format or cancel.I clicked Format but Unable to Format.,
"I've used SanDisk products for a long time without a problem and this is no exception. Good value, reliable, holds tons of data. What else is there to ask for?",
Recommended by GoPro for my camera.No problems even with very high shutter speeds.Next time I will purchase the 64GB version.,
card worked automatically and immediately in Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition tablet.  Transfer fast and faultless thus far.  Previous reports of issues with sandisk memory cards not working on some samsung/android devices concerned me but this doesn't seem to occur with the newer XC versions.,
32GB Card takes my smartphone to a new level.  Recently purchased a RazrM and this huge capacity card allows me to take tons of picture even with a good percentage of my MP3 collection and about 9 movies on MP4.  Fast and so far so good as far as data integrity.  Highly recommend,
"Its going back because it doesn't meet spec.Tested with  H2TestW, write speed is only 9.69 MB/s. Read speed is good at 18.80 MB/s. (although Sandisk claims up to 30MB/s)Meanwhile, a class (10) 32GB Transcend SD card I have writes at 15.30 and reads at 18.20.I also have a few class (6) 4GB Sandisk microSD cards writing at 15.40 and 15.50. Reading speed is 18.40 and 18.30.I also have a class (4) Kingston card that beats this class 10 Sandisk.",
"Great card. 2 years and 3 phones later and its still ticking. Excellent read/write speeds. Does very well in my Note 2 and Note 3. I did a directory swap on my note 2 so that I could use this 64gb as the &#34;phones memory&#34; while the 16gb in the phone was the &#34;external SD&#34;. Honestly, it was stupid the stopped letting apps be put on the sdcard (which they brought back in android 4.3) and I was always short on space due to the massive size of games these days. The card responded just like the phones built in memory as far as speed goes. Never saw a performance drop of any kind. Was able to play demanding games like NOVA3 or GTA3 without lag or any skipping. And the card survived 3 phones. First note 2 took a nasty plunge that totaled the phone. Card was perfectly fine.",
Got this to use in my go pro camera.  It works great.  Get the no hassle packaging so you don't have to have scissors to open it.,
I purchased this to expand the storage space of my Samsung Galaxy S3 and I love it!  It's fast and offers lots of storage space.  I use it to store several full length HD movies on my phone which I view when travelling.  In addition I have tons of music on it too.,
It is a good buy; it works great with my sports camera. It was well priced and I recommend it to all users of sport cameras.,
This was a great fast card and I had no issues with it. My GS3 recognized it quickly and still works a year later.,
Fits my Galaxy SIII and gives me lots of storage :] Should be just the thing that I was looking for,
we're early in the stages of home smartness but this is a good start,
"I added to a ""dot"" purchase for my daughter, and she loved it! The portability and charge feature she really likes. Great gift!",
The connection drop's out on this unit pretty bad. I can hardly get thru a game and it will disconnect.,
Bought this to use in my 8 inch Onda tablet.  No problems or issues installing or using.  Have about three months.  Would recommend to others.,
"The cars seemed great, but occasionally the card is suddenly &#34;not formatted&#34;, even without writing new data to it. Has happened in multiple devices.I lost some video I can't rerecord on it, and am fairly upset.Some forums say that the early runs of these cards did that occasionally and that it has been fixed on new runs, but I find it difficult to trust them now. I have never had this problem with any SanDisk product before, including the 5 of these cards I have in 32GB.Very disappointed.",
Great product! came with an adapter to plug into a camera or a regular sized card reader. The ultra allows for faster uploads and downloads onto the card!  Great for pictures and apps!,
I could not get this brand of memory card to work in my Roku.  It would not format correctly.  I had to return this for another brand which worked ok.,
"Bought it for my tablet.  it works well, and it has been working now for about 6 months.  I have no complaints.",
"never had a problem with it,it does exactly what it is made to do,love Sandisk product,smooth operation,high price but worth it.get it if you like to save,by waiting a day or two.enjoy",
"It's fast and not too expensive, Still works after several months, unlike a lot of cheaper cards.  You don't need this fast of a card in most phones if you just access but it makes a world of difference if you do a lot transferring.",
Never had any issues with sandisk adapter card or devices. They work great and this one is no exception. Very small media for my big fingers but I manage. to do what I need to with it and it works well. Last thing is that Amazon's prices are hard to beat!,
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
"Popped in my Galaxy S5. Works.Disk came with an enclosure to be used when inserting into PCs, laptops, and other devices.Shipping was fast.",
"I purchased this as a recommendation to use with a LS300W dashcam.  Like most dashcams, there is constant high definition writing to the SD card because of needed looping.  This works as expected.  Reliable and fast.",
"I had to replace the first one in my tablet! The first time I bought one of these for my tablet the disk became corrupted. I bought a replacement (this item,) and it seems to work just fine.",
"As the Kids Edition is nothing more than a basic 50 7 Kindle Fire with some extras, this review is primarily concerned with the 50-worth of extras bundled with the Kids Edition. Primarily, the year of included Freetime.As for the guts of the tablet itself, it's fine. Not great, but certainly fine. It's not the fastest tablet. It isn't the most feature-rich tablet. It doesn't have the sharpest display. But it's only 50, so it deserves to be graded on a curve. For a 50 tablet, it's great.Now, grab a coffee, get comfortable, because I have some thoughts on Amazon's Freetime service for kids/parents:Price plus the year of Freetime were the selling points for me (the case and added warranty were nice bonuses). The problem is, Freetime, though fantastic in theory, isn't even half-baked. It's a lump of dough left on the counter to rise. And then whoever was supposed to put it in the oven got distracted and forgot about it. It's getting moldy, and it smells kind of funny.Freetime: great in theory, terrible in practice.Normally, when you buy a new tablet, it might have a little bloatware pre-installed, but you generally don't start with the offerings of the entire app store on your homescreen. You find and add the apps you want.The way you install/remove apps in Freetime is sort of backwards. It's subtractive. Every single title is served up on the home screen (and in the apps, books, videos screens). These aren't technically pre-installed, but to a young kid looking at a sea of icons, it looks like he has all of these wonderful titles at his disposal. Well, he does. But only sort of. He clicks Elmo's face, and the wheel starts spinning over the icon while it downloads.Read more",
I Luke it a lot and good to for it for and good to,
I am giving this item a five star rating because it works well and can be used in a micro or standard format.,
can't say enough about it ... just works perfectly every time ... wish I could say the same about people ... great product,
I use these in my Logitech Alert cameras which are outside in the elements. These perform better and more importantly last longer than other cards do.,
"Got this card in early January for my Samsung Tab2 10.1 tablet.  Within a couple of weeks, it was loading music files incorrectly onto the card.  I did not know what was wrong, but finally thought I would format card again to see if that would correct the problem.  Card would not quick format or format slowly.  As always, Amazon is taking care of the problem and I will have replacement card within 24 hours!  Hope the replacement is more reliable.  I am just writing it off as a fluke, as I have never had a problem with a SanDisk product in the past.2/14/13:  When I called Amazon they replaced it - to my door - within 24 hours!  Replacement works fine.  Now that is GREAT service!",
"Easy to install screen protector, no bubbles. Fits just right on Fire phone. Will not disrupt most cases or change overall phone dimensions. Great item if you are letting your kid/grandkids use or play with your phone. This item will not disrupt the dynamic perspective or front facing cameras. Very good anti-glare properties, can notice a large difference.",
I hate how people complain the transfer speed isn't the &#34;promised&#34;  30/mbs. It even says in the fine print that it depends on the product you are using the card on. I bought this to upgrade my Galaxy Note 2s memory. Bought on sale for about 20$ and Amazon credited me the difference when it went on sale a week later for 17$. Very satisfied great product and great customer service. Thanks Amazon!,
"No way to format it. I even downloaded 2 programs that claimed were able to format it, After wasting about 6 hours, I decided to give up and send it back, The seller should format them before sending them, even if they would charge $5. extra, it would be well worth it instead of the hassle of downloading programs and wasting time trying and sending it back after hours of frustration.",
"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysOctober 1, 2012Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're glad you're enjoying your Kindle Fire HD, and we are particularly excited to see your encouraging comments regarding the display and sound quality, as the team worked really hard to build an excellent experience. We wanted to answer your question about storage. HD content is much larger than SD content, which is why Kindle Fire HD starts at 16GB. On average, a 90 minute HD movie is 2GB and a 45 minute HD TV episode is 0.9GB. With your 16GB Kindle Fire HD, you can have up to 6 HD movies or 13 HD TV episodes. This number will vary depending on the other items you have stored or installed on your device. We hope this information helps.Thanks, The Kindle Team",
"While it seemed to work fine, the Tap does not have the open mic feature. While that can be best for some, I bought it as a gift and they would prefer one that listens. The Tap makes you press the mic button every time you wish to communicate with Alexa, which seems to defeat the purpose.",
"Works Great with my Note 2.  Had no problems installing it and I didn't have to format or anything.  I put it in, turned the phone back on and everything transferred over quickly.Thanks!",

Don't know how I managed without Alexa. Everyone in the family is enjoying her.,
Sandisk are the definitive memory products. PERIOD! I have tried to save few bucks here and there and I have lost all the money and all the data. Fristration free package is the simpliest way to get the card in your hand,
"been using it for about a year now with no issues. come on amazon, how much more can i put on this review? it's a memory card.",
"My first card ordered was bad - my tablet and my computer wouldn't write to it, wouldn't read it. Amazon replaced it immediately and my new card is perfect. Reads and writes very fast, much faster than the HC in my phone. I'm glad I got the HC 1 for my tablet.",
"Picked this up for my Sport Action camera and it's just what I needed. Class 10 and the speeds match up with the rating. Came with a SD card adapter which was a nice bonus. Been using it for almost 2 months now with formatting after each filming. No lag on any of the video, no problems with card, running strong.",
"This card has worked flawlessly so far. I use it in my Garmin Montana 600 and it allows me to load all my USGS 1:24,000 quads (US - SW, W, S Central, N Central and inland lakes) I was at first concerned that the 600 would not take 32 gb micro SD but no problem.",
"I have several devices that use micro cards, so I buy these in anticipation of needs in the future. So I am not going to test this to see if it works when I get this. Most items I buy at a good price. Now if I am loading up cameras and recording gear for a trip or maybe a day at Le Mans. I will check them before I travel, as I check batteries and spares and chargers.So far I have not had a problem with SanDisk, I am gearing up for a trip, my destination is a bit in question at this point.",
Good fast and reliable SDHC for the price can't beat it! Been using this for video and photos no issues at all.,

"While updating maps for my Nuvi 40 I received a message stating I needed more memory to download new versions of maps that I required.This was probably a bit of overkill, but the price was right, so I ordered one.

Great Deal and much faster file movement.Definitely worth the purchase and sandisk has proved why they have good products.,
"This was a excellent gift for the family, A good choice.",
What can I say...it's a memory card.  Aren't they all the same?  No problems or issues with this product.  It works as described!,

"I purchased this card for my Motorola Photon Q 4G LTE.  This is a well spect card and is nice and fast.  Installed with no problem.  If you looking for a higher end SD card for your phone or other applications and 32 gigs is what you need, you can't go wrong here.  Highly recommended.",
"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",

"I owned one of these for a year before it lost its ability to write to itself. This was very disappointing, but not a deal breaker for me because San Disk products are usually built to last. I believe I just received a bad one from the batch that mine came from.",
I needed a memory upgrade for my phone which is a Galaxy S3. The time I got it was on sale and  it has yet to fail me once. It stores a good amount of media for my device and can hold a number of 1080 movies and full resolution  pictures I have taken. Very handy for those long distance trips.,

This product is great my phone doesnt lock up anymore.

The docs for my Smart Phone said that this card would work in it.  After talking to SanDisk support I was told that a 32GB card was the max for my phone.  So I returned this card for a 32GB.  This card is probably a very good product.  Just the documentation for my phone was bad.,
"I bought this for a Sansa Clip+, it worked after formatting the card to FAT32.  Can't say much other than I have tons of lossless songs here that were previously on CDs.  What I don't like in general is that manufacturers LIE about real size of cards arguing some technical issue, it's like saying that 2+2=5, when in reality is not, this card like any other card is not 64gb, it's more like 62gb (can't remember exact size, don't have card available at hand).2+2 is not =5.  This card is advertised as 64gb yet in reality is lower, manufactures using false advertising as usual. This kinds of memory cards are a good example of false advertisement.",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
"What can I say, it's a memory card. Good price for a nice performing card - I'd definitely buy again.",
Amazon sells this card for a great value! No local store even comes close to this price. It has plenty of room on it for lots of storage.,
"I would give it a 4 star review if it didn't keep having reoccurring issues with wired Ethernet connection. For some reason I have to keep taking out the Ethernet cable and plugging it back in the device in order for it to recognize the wired connection. Now, the funny thing is that the wifi connection works fine. The reason that is funny or ironic is that typically that is where most devices have an issue when it comes to internet connection. The reason I choose being wired in is because I want fast data transfer.. Now, the Fire works well with everything else.. very smooth and the interface is well laid out...",
I have many microSD cards like many of you guys might too. It's definitely faster than other microSD cards that i've used before. I'm happy with it.,
"Much more than a Bluetooth speaker. It is great to listen to music from Pandora, Amazon, etc with it streaming directly from wifi. Saves the battery on my phone. As others have said I wish that it had an option of having the voice activation on all times but I guess they didn't put that in to save battery life. Maybe something for the next generation TAp",
So far i haven't had any issues. It's working and is compatible with my phone. Quick shipping. Im satisfied with my purchase,
I upgraded from my 8 GB SD to this one and it was great to have the extra space.No problems with it.I removed the SD card from my phone and copied the files up to my computer using the adapter that came with the new card.  I copied the files to my new 32 GB MicroSDHC and installed it in my Galaxy S4 and it worked great.I liked the color. Makes it easier to see on my black desk.,
"If you have to have the max storage on your phone... this is it. Not only is it the fastest class available, it is the ONLY decent 128 card available right now. Not a bad price, either.",
"Works great, low cost, fast, and the bright red makes it easier to find when it gets dropped or misplaced. SanDisk is usually my go to brand for removable media.",
I can't complain. The memory card does its job. I recieved the memory card very quickly and I have not had any issues with the card as of yet.,
"Here goes, I'm the 9 thousandth reviewer for this product LOL. short preface: I love Amazon, so when comparing all streaming devices in the end I went with the Fire TV because of the outstanding customer service, and it will improve with time. That being said, I share the frustrations that all my fellow buyers have: I hate not being able to sort out the non Prime videos, I truly dislike paying for an episode (I didn't see that one coming, even though I did a ton of research). But overall I love my new cable bill, which only includes internet and basic, and I mean basic, service (15.00) because I'm reserving the right to order HBO and Showtime at some point. Was massively disappointed in Hulu Plus, because they don't offer the entire series in a show anymore (did they run out of server space or what) Netflix was a pleasant surprise. In case you are wondering, Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Prime are your alternatives to paying your cable bill. And streaming is quite alright...after you get over the initial shock of not having live TV, although, ABC does do live TV hope the other stations follow suit soon. Overall, as a non tech person, it was ridiculously easy to hook this up, really anyone can do it. And like I said, if you're comparing other products, in the end Amazon cannot be beat for customer service or support.",
Bought to increase memory in my Samsung Galaxy III.  Use my phone for business and pleasure and needed the memory upgrade. Works great.,
"Alexa do ........something? Welcome to the new interconnected world Circlers! Do you want a speaker to stream your music at a voice command? This may be for you! Do you feel that technology is driving our lives more and more toward the dystopia of David Eggers ""The Circle"" and you want to escape from technology for a while? Then likely not, as even though you have to touch the button on this unit as opposed to the always on Echo and Echo Dots, your life is still connected to Alexa via voice prompts! I liked using it for Amazon music, and the occasional Amazon Video, but i have yet to order a pizza or hail an Uber. Some people may feel they need technology to run their lives, I am not quite there yet and may never be! It is fun for what it does though, and it is a good bluetooth speaker!",
The only problem was in getting it to format to fat32 so that I could use it in myexcellent Sansa Clip+. I actually had to do a low level format and then reformat itto fat32 with  third party programs. It comes natively formatted to ex fat which many devices don't read (windows only formats fat32 to 32GB ). It's easy to format it to NTFS but either buy nothing bigger than 32GB or search the internet for programs and methods to reformat it if you need fat32 and you have the skill and time.Otherwise its good stuff but Scan-disk should provide a reformat program on their website imho?,
"I purchased this card (the 64GB version) to use in a Samsung Galaxy S2 phone. It worked perfectly for almost three months, at which point it just stopped mounting. The phone detects a card, but is incapable of formatting it. It's even worse on my computer, which does not even detect the card anymore (and yes, I'm using an SDXC-compatible USB reader).I contacted SanDisk for an RMA and they will probably replace it, although the replacement process is needlessly slow and painful.I had bought this card based on the glowing reviews, but I'm going to stay away from SanDisk products from now on.",
Bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works perfectly.  Price was better than anything I could find in the stores locally.,
"I'm using this with my Samsung Galaxy S3 to expand the built-in 16 GB memory. My modest music collection uses about 10 GB, so I needed this micro SDHC card for a little more breathing room. I went with 32 GB which should last me for the life of the phone. I've been using it for a month with no problems. If your phone supports micro SDHC memory expansion, this is the one for you to get.",
"What can I say SanDisk has the micro SD figured out.  Works with Asus Memo pad hd 7, movies for long trips.",
"In some situations, depending on what hardware you intend to use this card in you'll need to format it in a special way using a formatting utility that doesn't come native to windows.  Also, the card gets extremely hot under heavy load.",
I love its portability! The speakers are phenomenal!,
Purchase this for my GoPro Hero3. It was absolutely perfect and fair in price. I might just purchase another one(1).,
Received my new kindle in perfect condition and I am very happy it is faster and a clearer it has a. bigger had drive at a good price and a fast delivery that you can count on you can not go wrongThank you,
"randomly erases all my data and asks me to format card on my unmodified unrooted sprint Galaxy SIII ,i dont know how scandisk is selling these,i trusted the brand and it didnt work",
"Used in my phone it's plenty fast and works just like it should. Unexpectedly comes with mini and full SD card size adapters, which is nice. &#34;Fool-proof&#34; packaging or whatever it was, that was laughable. Packaging was decent it just shouldn't have bragged about being impossible to mess up when I messed it up.",
"Yes..this is my 6th Kindle Fire HD 7 and I am sharing my story so you are not discouraged! My previous Kindle Fire performed well and I decided to upgrade to the newer model with 16GB. My 2nd Kindle Fire arrived as a Christmas gift and the first week I used it, the unit crashed. Ouch! My previous generation-now referred to as Old Faithful -never failed me. I followed the onscreen instructions for Kindle2 and rebooted my device. After using my device for about 30 minutes, it crashed again and the on-screen instructions said to reboot the reset the entire device. I reset the device and lost all my settings, then again after using the device it crashed. I was not a happy customer so I called Kindle Support.If you are not bored yet...keep reading....Kindle support told me NOT to reset the device, because this erases the memory on their support side and they are unable to resolve the issue from their end if I reset the device. They advised me to call them when this happens. After a conversation about my new device not working, they agreed to send me another Kindle.Kindle 3, 4 and 5 all arrived...and I returned all of them when I discovered they were refurbished units. Since my device was brand new and I had only used it one week, I expected a brand new device as a replacement. On Kindle 6 I ended up placing a new order (rather than an exchange order) and then returned the refurbished units they continued to send me. Problem resolved.It gets worse...Kindle 6 crashed too! Within the first week...again!This time I did not reset the device and instead I would reboot the device. I did this each time I turned on the Kindle.Read more",
Didn't expect any problems and didn't have any either.  Great SanDisk quality at a decent price.  Speed as rated.  Happy,
"But then again, I expect nothing less. Most of my compact flash and SD cards are SanDisk brand and have been extremely reliable.",
This speaker is great and not only is it a speaker but it's got the Alexa application!,
Not much more to say; it's a good quality SD card that does the job (presently in a Galaxy S5) with no issues whatsoever.  As you'd expect.,
"Stay away from no-name-brand flash memory and get a quality Sandisk. I've owned dozens of their USB flash drives, CompactFlash, SD and microSD cards over the years and they just WORK!as for this particular model, i have the 64gb microSD in my Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 tablet and a 16gb microSD my Galaxy Note 2 smartphone...popped 'em in and the devices recognized them no problem. I can drag/drop copy/paste files from internal storage to the cards without issue, on the fly or plugged into my computers. i always recommend Sandisk to anyone looking to expand their storage capacity.",
"I got this for a Microsoft Surface.  It does exactly what I wanted it to do (wish the Surface was more user friendly with it though... but, that's another story).  One thing to watch out for: this will not work in older SDHC compliant devices.  I tried it in my D80 and it wouldn't work at all.  That's not a problem with the device so much as with the buyer knowing what they are buying.",
"I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  It works perfectly with no strange behavior, great speed, and the SanDisk name to back it up.  Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend.",
Reliable and well-regulated for dual voltage (110-120v and 220-240v) without too much heat generation in Europe/Asia.,
"From latest news flash, to weather info, to hearing a joke while cooking and waiting for Alexa to set a timer, the Amazon Tap is a fun tool to have around the house!",
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
"I replaced the brown suede cover that came with my Kindle because I'd dropped it a couple of times, and it had problems staying connected. It wouldn't charge so it was pretty much useless. I went with the leather cover because the suede cover, while nice to touch, did get worn(I had one on my old Kindle Paper White), so I decided a leather cover would be better. The color is as lovely as a glass of Merlot and stays connected so far. I love using this new Kindle Oasis because it's so much lighter than my old Paper White.",
I bought this for my Go Pro and it works as intended. The video records properly with no choppiness or other defects.,
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
Used it on my GoPro Hero 3 and works great found SanDisk to always make excellent products. Money well spent.,
"I've never had a defective SanDisk SD card and this is no exception. They are well built and quality control is wonderful. I am especially sold on the 10 speed class and would highly recommend this for any type of media; books, movies, music, etc.",
"Updated 6/617 - so useful we now have 3 of these along with the full sized echo Amazon Echo - BlackAfter using the full sized Echo for a couple of months thought it would be nice to expand on that one piece of hardware. I had no experience with the 'Dot' so i went ahead and shopped for the refurbished (a first as well.) The Dot arrived in a small plain box. Upon removal found the Dot to look just like new. No blemishes, scuffs, dings, nothing whatsoever to indicate based on appearance it was anything other than new. it comes with plug, usb charging cable.that said what matters most is how it functions. i was concerned being refurbished but no worries it worked just as good as new. the device works exactly the same as the full sized Echo. For myself the biggest difference was the addition of a 3.5mm aux out jack. While you can pair both this and its larger 'big brother' to any Bluetooth speaker i have a set of wired Bose headphones and needed that extra bit so i could use them too.how do the Dot full sized Echo compare differences are surprisingly few. as said the Dot has a 3.5mm jack so you can use it with any wired speaker, headphones or earbuds while the Echo does not. the Dot when listening to speech or low volumes other sounds very good and at the same volume level i could not tell a difference between either of the two. however at higher volumes the Dot struggles with the larger Echo easily winning out. otherwise but for appearance they both function the same.as for what the Echo or smaller version Dot can doRead more",
"I use it in my Note2. It does what it's supposed to do, and extends the storage capacity for this great phone!",

"If you're reading reviews of the new 3rd generation Paperwhite, you're likely considering buying one. If so, you're probably in one of these categories:* Never owned a Kindle e-ink reader* Own an older Kindle e-ink reader, but not a Paperwhite* Own a first or second generation PaperwhiteI'll save my opinion on whether the new Paperwhite 3 is worth buying until the end of my review. (But I will say this: They've taken a great product and made it even better.) First, here's a comparison of the new Paperwhite with the second generation Paperwhite (comparisons are for the wi-fi models):Second Generation Paperwhite (2013)-------------------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.3 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 212 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: TouchscreenNumber of fonts: 6Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lightingAll-New Paperwhite (2015)------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.2 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: TouchscreenNumber of fonts: 7Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lightingNote that the physical size is identical to the older Paperwhite, so covers and sleeves that worked with the older Paperwhites are still usable (thank you, Amazon). The most obvious difference is the screen resolution: 300 pixels per inch is a major jump from the 212 pixels per inch in the older Paperwhites.Read more",
"I was afraid to buy it for so many comments saying it doesn&#8217;t work with hero3 at high resolutions video, but it was not my case.",
Amazing how 64GB now fits on a micro card.  I added this to the ASUS Vivo Tablet to extend the memory and am very glad that I purchased it.  Working great and have always trusted ScanDisk!Great item......Great purchase!,
Well worth the money high storage/ cheap and fast enough for a phone sure you can  get faster cards but you really don't need it,
"I had an HTC EVO DESIGN 4G and I added this card to it. It was like 4x faster to transfer files to it from a computer and games like N.O.V.A. 2 which put a massive amount of files on your microSD loads so much faster. I put ALL my apps on my SD and noticed no difference in performance of the games or apps.I had one problem though, and it was that my phone would repeatedly say that the card was unmounted or it couldn't find the card. Popping of the battery cover and pulling out the card and reinserting would fix this, or just a reboot. I thought this was the fault of the card, but since I have upgraded to an HTC EVO 4G LTE, I have had no Issues with the card.So, If you have issues with your phone not reading the card, IT MIGHT BE YOUR PHONE.",
Now I have a lot more room on my phone. It can be overkill for some but extra space is only wasted if you never use it.,
"I have a low-end Android phone and this made using it that much easier because of increased responsiveness and of course, storage capacity.",
"If you carry two of these, one in your camera and one in the camera case pocket (don't lose it), you will never run out of memory. Enough capacity at ~4MB/image to shoot and shoot and shoot.  Download at the end of the day if you want, but you have thousands of pictures on one of these. Couple with batteries (see WASABI review) and you can just never stop shooting.",
My 8 yr old daughter loves her Tap. She uses it for HW and play. Never a dual moment when she is learning something new from her Tap.,
"This tiny little card fit right into the slot on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.The tablet recognized it right away and after some tweaking we are using the card as a storage backup for music, photos and video.",
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
I ordered this to replace an aging Class 4 card being used with N2A (Nook 2 Android) KitKat 4.4.  This card turned that into a usable Android tablet!  N2A with the Class 4 card was brutally slow but now the tablet is very useful.  Definitely worth the upgrade.,
"I can use it to store my data~ It is good for my computer~Also , it is fast~It is a great way to store data~never lost~",
"Storage prices will always go down (though I won't say at what rate over what interval of time, a la Moore's Law - I'm not that smart.) At the time I purchased it, it was a very good price for this amount of memory.  In a year's time, it will probably be a laughably expensive sum for a pittance of storage.  Oh, well.With it in my phone, I don't have to worry about the number of photos or the duration of video I take.",
"The thing I hate about writing reviews for products like this is that they either work or they don't. There's not a lot of &#34;user experience&#34; to be had. If the card is fast enough and doesn't give you read/write errors then it should get five stars, right?Five stars!",
I bought this memory card to be used in my GoPro Hero3 Black.  I couldn't believe how small the card is!  SanDisk isn't kidding when they say &#34;Micro&#34;.  I've taken photos and videos all over California and its worked without issue.  Definitely worth the investment!,
I have found this chip works well even in conditions that aren't ideal. I bought a 16gb galaxy s 3 and tried this chip but the phone has a flaw with the 32gb Microsoft chips so it worked for a month then would randomly eject the card when I didn't do anything.,
This memory card works well will my GoPro. It records the video without any stuttering and sputtering. I recommend this and will buy more.,
I bought this for my Sony action cam.  At 720p@30fps I get 11 hrs of recording which is awesome.  This card is more than fast enough for that cam.  The price was great too.  It comes with the regular SD card adapter so don't worry about buying one in addition.  The packaging can be difficult to get into though.,
very useful for surface pro to increase capacity from 128GB. Can also be used as backup in case something goes wrong,
Bought this for my Samsung Exhibit which has a small internal memory so I could move Google translate onto it. That did not work out since almost all apps wont transfer over to the memory card. But now I can take a ton of photos/videos and store music. No problem with it so far.,
I always buy SanDisk when thinking of micro memory.  This memory is fast and holds a lot!  I use it as extra storage within my hotspot.,
"items like this, they either work or they don't so in that regards, whether it worked or not is about all you can comment on in a review.  For me, it worked just fine and the camera never hit buffering moments that slowed down shooting performance.",
"Only been a month or so but best price, quick shipping and MASSIVE storage.  I didn't run speed tests or anything but no issues.  I will edit this review if I have a problem down the road.",
"It works just fine in my Galaxy 3s phone.  Now, I more room than I know what to do with.",
Like a previous reviewer mentioned it is fabric over hard plastic it is not a snug or tight fit. Good quality though.,
Larger than move and was a high class.I use this on my S4 and works wonderfully.I store all images on SD take quck second to load but much faster and better than the last SD card i had which was a class 6,
"Got this yesterday, the 64GB item. Installed it in my new Samsung Tab3 and turned it on. the Tab3 saw it right away, and I decided to format it,,, only took a couple of seconds and I was good to go. It shows that I have 59,000 memory units available, they must use the rest for overhead I guess. I haven't used it yet, but I am sure it will work fine. If I have any problems I will note here,,, also if I have great praise for it I will note that also. At $34.99 I guess it was a good price as I see it is now $46.00, maybe I shoulda ordered two of them. This is my first time for a lap top, and I will be on a big learning curve. I got the lap top at Costco last week,,,,,,,, I sure hope a old dog can learn new tricks.....",
"This micro SD card holds quite a bit of stuff. Not all my stuff, but most of my stuff. I like that.",
"Works well, and fast, does everything it claims to do.  These sshd items are the best.  You cannot hurt them, and they last forever.",
I was able to use this microSD card with my Samsung Galaxy S3.  I just had to format it when it was in the phone.  The only reason not a 5 star is that it's not as fast as the more expensive versions.,
"Every SanDisk card I've ever bought has never disappointed me and this one wasn't the exception. I use one with my Galaxy Tab 3 and so far it has performed superbly and I have zero complaints.I realize there are quite a few bad reviews for this card but I have never ran into a bad SanDisk card and I hope I won't in the future. I feel bad for the ppl who get the ONE bad card in a batch of thousands, but yeah, it happens.",
I feel that San Disk seems to make the best memory cards. -I can't validate technically but this seems to be fast acess and seems to be problem free. I have confidence that &#34;must have picture&#34; will be captured properly.,
Came with adapter as described and works perfectly. I use this SDHC card with my GoPro Hero 3+ black and haven't been able to fill it up yet.,
"This was immediately recognized by my Windows 8.1 laptop. I had to re-format this from ExFAT to FAT32 in order to have it be recognized by my Samsung Note 2 and my 7&#34; Android tablet.It took a long time to transfer 25 gb of video files from laptop SSD hard drive over to the SdXC card--I imagined that it would happen more quickly. .. but it did work smoothly.Overall, this is what I wanted and it was a great deal for the price!",
"Bought this 64gb micro SD for my galaxy S3 32gb smart phone.  Not only did it increase the size of my memory greatly,  the speed is noticeably better then the 16gb unit that came with my old DROID X smartphone.  I've put a thousand songs,  many pictures,  moved many apps to this storage unit and still have many gigs left both on my main phones memory and  memory card.  I will not purchase any smartphone that doesn't offer SD expansion,  and look forward to the next step to 128gb or higher.",
This is a horrible an overpriced case. I've had this case for less than two weeks and it's already coming apart. The little rubber stitching around the case is falling off,
"As with other recent Fire covers by Amazon, the cover has a snap-in plastic shell that holds the Fire securely and will not let it fall out. (I've used plastic shells similar to this for years with my Kindles and Kindle Fires, and none of them has ever slipped out.)Another feature that I look for is Auto Wake/Sleep, which automatically wakes the tablet when you open the cover and puts it to sleep when the cover is closed. It's a very useful feature that helps to extend battery life, since you don't have to remember to hit the power switch when you close the cover. It's also a huge convenience feature.Other comments:* All of the Fire's ports and controls are on top of the Fire, which is open on the case. The speakers are covered, but when the case is opened, they're uncovered. Note that the cover does block the micro SD card port on the side.* The microfiber inside of the top cover helps prevent scratches to the display screen.* The front cover can be folded to act as a viewing stand. It's a nice feature, especially for watching videos.* With the cover folded back on itself, the rear camera is blocked. To use the camera, you'll have to keep the cover open. But honestly, how often are you going to use the Fire's rear camera, which at 2 MP is pretty lame.",
"Works as advertised, no issues to date.  There are faster cards out there but you will pay more for them.",
"The ScanDisk 63 GB  SDXC card is a geat value and I get HOURS of recording HD video with wonderful results. I prefer ScanDisk because they are reliable.

JUST ISN'T SMART.  I must have reliability and ScanDisk delivers!",
"I purchased this as a gift for my daughter because she takes a lot of photos stored on her cell and bogs it down. It will be a while now before she needs to clean house again, LOL! Would also be good for those that need to store everything, you know who you are, now get one...R/KMW",
I finally have a micro SD card that I can use to transfer pictures from my computer to my photo printer.  Works flawlessly.,
"This review is for the second generation Kindle Paperwhite. Like all kindle e-readers before it, this is a great product. However, I am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year's model. For this review, I focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new Paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year's model. Also, I found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising, so I will try to clear them up.HARDWAREDesign - The Kindle white has a nice look and shape. It fits well and is easy to hold in one hand. It's fairly light, so it doesn't tire the hands too much. I can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands. Its design is very similar to the previous Paperwhite - almost identical. The height and width are the same, the buttons are in the same location, and although this version is slightly lighter, it is not noticeable.Display - Although not a huge improvement from last year's model, the display is one of the best features of the Paperwhite. Like most e-readers, the Paperwhite uses digital ink technology. This model employs a more advanced version. In addition, the lighting has been upgraded, so among other things, it is more evenly lit. Together, they make for incredible viewing. In my opinion, it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. I really enjoy reading on it, text look very sharp and crisp, with little to no eye strain.Processor - The Paperwhite has an upgraded processor, which means smoother page turns and navigation. I am able to open books, flip pages, and navigate menus fairly quickly. There is barely any lag as I flip through many pages at a time. Also, the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all.Read more",
"reasonable price, good quality. not much more needs to be said.",
"good quality microsd card. cannot gain 30MB/s read speed but it may be because of 2.0 usb card reader because hdd connected to the same usb port give no more than 20MB/s speed, same as this card. i have bought both 32GB and 64GB. 64GB works perfect in my HTC EVO 3d.",
"Echo Dot in my GMC Sierra Denali. At first she was just there with no support. She sat in that hole with no protection. Shifting, jiggling not knowing what can happen. There has to be something I can do. I looked and search and what I found is the Fabric Case for Alexa. This is it! A support she will be happy to wear. No more accidental popping out, no more shifting and readjusting, she is finally safe.",
It worked well that one time I put some files on it. It was easily read by my computer and phone. Then I lost it because it was so tiny. Oh well!,
seems to be working just fine...bought as a gift for a family member and they're using it for video recording.,
When you add the MLB and PBS aps I will switch from Roku......Roku customer service is terrible and they dont seem to care if you're happy with their product or not.,
"Just setup my new FireTV ordered via my Amazon account and so far so good so fast. Setup time: 10 minutes.The good:1. NO setup to access Amazon content.I am already a Prime member so once I had my wifi setup the FireTV did a quick scan of the internet for updates before running the tutorial video. To my surprise once the tutorial was completed I was welcomed by web my Amazon username (Hello insert name)complete with my Watch List and Video Library. No additional steps needed to access my content. Cool and creepy at the same time. But, who am I kidding my electronic footprint is large.2. Super fast. The FireTV interface (content menu system) is quick and straightforward. It's a better faster interface than any of my other devices I own that streams Amazon content (PS3, XBOX deprecated, iPad, Vizio SmartTV, and wifi enabled BD player). I do not have a Netflix membership so I haven't tried it yet (Maybe there's a free trial attached, but will Amazon allow that). I played a movie out of my Amazon Video Library and it started instantly. Missing is the your content is still loading delay. I am telling you the movie started immediately.3. PRIME content. I read some comments that stated posters had trouble being able to easily identify PRIME content. I am not having the same problem. All PRIME content displays the blue PRIME banner in the upper left hand corner as it does on all the other devices mentioned above. So maybe there has been a software update since. Which means Amazon heard you.4. Power. I was concerned over the lack of a power button on the remote or FireTV unit itself which I thought meant the device would have to be manually disconnected from the power source. NOT SO The device goes to sleep (no power LED activity) after a set period of time and is easily awaken by the press of a button on the remote. Perfect.The bad:1. Haven't found it yet.",
I bought this for my Lenovo A2109 tablet which alot of sites say wont work.  Once I formatted it to FAT32 it worked flawlessly.  Its fast and provides tons of storage to my 16gb tablet.,
Bought this for my new smartphone.  Installed easily and works as required.  In many years I have had no problems with any San Disk product that I have used.,
got this because i had a 2 GB one that filled up. i kept getting the insufficient disk space on my phone. my kids take my phone and do selfies. mostly my daughter. I had to get a bigger card. the 2GB one was a carry over from an old phone.needless to say this was sweet. plenty of space. and i dont have to delete pictures anymore. well for now at least.my daughter loves selfies.,
"With most of the world's electronic devices finally standardizing to SD (thank you Sony for finally adopting this standard), it seems most things we own work on either the microSD or regular SD card.  That's why this little package is so handy.  You get both in one neat little package and at 64GB, you'll have plenty of space to store most of your programs, files, etc on your device.The Class 10 rating (ability to move data on/off card at the current maximum speed) is a must for anyone that doesn't want to sit for vital seconds waiting for data to write to the card.  And SanDisk has proven themselves over the years as making a quality product.  Sure, you may occasionally find a dud in their inventory, but they are quick to fix/replace it and that is what matters most.  Buying cheaper cards will land you with a read/write error when you can least afford it.  Don't be the person that loses those important family photos or that document that is due today because of a cheap and defective card.I purchased this particular card for my Asus Transformer, as it fits nicely into the pad itself - and with the optional keyboard attachment (which is capable of holding standard SD cards) it fits there as well.  Making this the perfect solution for my extra memory needs and at a much better bargain than most competitors.  You can certainly purchase more internal memory on your iProduct or Android device (most seem to have 16GB or 32GB variants), but why spend the extra cash for 16GB extra, when you can buy far more in an external card?",
"A standard when it comes to high capacity mobile memory.  Grated, if you have an older android phone, or older tablet, you probably won't see much difference.  But if you have a modern device like a galaxy s4, or note 3, or equivalent mobile device, you'll definitely notice the difference in data transfer and access in your device.  For modern phones, a UHS-1 memory card is a must.  The only reason I didn't give this product five stars is because it's not a sandisk extreme, or a sandisk extreme pro.  But then again, you must have EXTREMELY specific needs to want to get 85MB/s transfer speeds on a mobile device.  For movies, music and apps, this one is more that adequate.",
It is a quality product and has clear crisp sound. Best part it can be carried in any satchel. Sound is loud enough for a back yard gathering.,
"Comes with an SD card adapter.  Not much I can say about an SD card, but I would recommend it for the price!",
Just what the doctor ordered for my Galaxy Tab 3 Tablet... Now there's plently of room left over for everything...,
"I recently purchased a new SanDisk 64GB micro SD card and I'm very happy with the read/write speeds. I do a lot of videoing of my grandkids and this card does exactly as advertised.  Never any lag time or missed frames with this card, and with an adapter I can use it all my devices.",
"When my new Fire TV arrived today, I was cautiously optimistic. We have two Kindle Fires in the house, a 1st Gen and the previous Gen, and we love them. So here is my initial thoughts, I will update this review as time goes by.First impressions, as always Amazon does a great job on the packaging, and this box is actually a little more elegant than when we ordered our fist e-reader way back when. But it carries the glossy black look they used in the past now for the Fire tablets. The box was easy open and the device neatly tucked inside.Hook up was as easy as it gets, and connecting to my Wifi wasn't a problem. It did need a software update out of the box, which these days isnt uncommon. The problem here was I was already seeing an issue. It kept telling me my connection seemed slower than usually I needed to check it. Having the robust network we must have for a house full of online gamers I knew there could only be a couple of problems. My other devices were working fine on the network, but to alleviate any strain on it i disconnected them all and reset my connection at the modem and router. The download resumed, but still with the same message at the bottom. After about 30 or 45 minutes I finally got the introduction video.So, off and running, I go the app store to spend the coins I got for purchasing the additional controller, see this reveiw, http://www.amazon.com/review/RGDZLYOUBIDI6/refcmcrrdpperm . While trying to download a handful of games, which it ques nicely to keep from over working its self, I ran into these problems. - the interface was slow load images for the apps I was looking at, and somtimes refused to populate the list I was trying to view - it also would randomly disconnect from the network. This points to a connection issue that i stated earlier. But now I am convinced it is the Wifi radio in the device. I have had gaming systems and streaming devices in this room before and never experienced this issue. This could also be what was causing the previously stated issue with the menus. - there is no way to force sleep the unit or turn it off.So, I proceed to call tech support. The guy on the phone was really nice and tried to be helpful, but he had no training on the device other than what little he had played around with his. He says, the device will eventually go to sleep, but isnt sure of how long it will take. As far as the wifi goes he suggested doing everything I had already done, except for unpluggin the device for about 3 seconds or so. So I try this, he has me stream something from Prime, which works great, but as soon as i start to download something again, the connection is lost. The phone call ends up being a waste of time. At this point I am disappointed. I know this is a new device and will have issues, but the Wifi this is proven tech it should work.Pros:Beautiful minimalist designease of setupsmall foot printgames look great, once you get them to workCons:Customer service wasn't trained on trouble shootingWifi connectivity sporadicNo way to force sleep or power down deviceIn the end, it could be a great product. I am going to give it some time and see if another software update might be on the way, or if maybe something was wrong with my network yesterday. I will update soon.**********Update 04/07/14:After a full weekend of putting the Fire TV through the paces I have updated my initial 2 star rating to a four. Here are the reasons why.The network issue appears to be just that, a network issue. Whether it was on my end or because of it being the first full day of release I do not know. But I did not have the connection issue again all weekend. Seeing as this was the biggest reason for my 2 star rating, I have changed that.As far as the auto sleep mode, for those that like to be able to control when something is on, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. The Fire is very fickle about this. But as someone pointed out in the comments and I do agree with them, it is a very minimal power draw and as along as you don't leave your TV on it shouldn't affect anything.The few games I played were good as far as casual gaming goes. No buggy or jerky movements. But you must remember, this is for casual gaming. You are not going to console quality out of this.Hope this all helps.",
Awesome storage. So much space. You just have to format it to the correct format for a phone. and walla you have a ton of space.,
"SanDisk  is consistently the best media out there.  It works ever time and is always compatible with all my devices.  I have never had an issue with SanDisk.  Quote simply, they just work.",
Brought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loves it! Great product for the price.,
I am AMAZED that I can buy 32 GB of nonvolatile memory for so little! Used it in my new Sony HDR-AS15 action camcorder with no problems.,
"Would recommend. I have 2 of those, one in phone one in tablet. Probably i will get one more for GF.",
It is a 64MB microSD card with a sd card adapter. I used it in my Samsung 3GS cell phone without issue.,
True to its name! Sandisk is the best! I am only using this for my smartphone so I guess it's overkill! Many said this type of micro SD card is meant for DSLR's. I'm going for quality and something that would last a long time. That's why I went for this. Highly recommended!,
"I bought this to add more storage to a Sharper Image action (Go Pro knock-off) camera, and it fits the bill perfectly. The camera came with a generic 4gb card, but this 32gb Class 10 card provides much smoother playback. A nice deal for just under $17.",
"The first few weeks after I bought this, I had some problems (like my phone can't detect the micro SD card). I tried formatting or repairing the card, but no success. So I returned this to SanDisk and they willingly replaced this in a week. No more questions asked. And since then, I'm still using the 2nd card that I received. No problems until now.",
"LOVE OUR NEW ECHO! I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them echolettes LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request.Read more",
Works well working as designed... Fast and Furious. I'm using in my Samsung Galaxy 4S and loving it. Have music and photos on it and the access time in the photo gallery very quick.,
"Bought it while it was one sale for $35.... I love itIt has given my Surface some wiggle room.Don't expect the read and write speed to be super fast. Most likely you computer doesn't support the current protocol to transfer at the Max speed.Overall Quality you expect from SanDisk though I think the price of this can come down bit more, now that the market is slowly moving away from microSD expansion aside from Samsung",
Amazing how much stuff you can save on this little card.  SanDisk has always been reliable and I would recommend it.  Amazon seems to have the best prices.,
"I purchased this product knowing there might be an issue with the galaxy s4. This card worked for a week or two then began to spontaneously unmount and would mount itself back in. The unmount periods began to become longer than a few hours, days! I tried this card in a galaxy note 2 still with the same result. I attempted to contact Sandisk customer service and utilize the warranty. They know of the problem and began the exchange process then instructed me to wait for a mailing label that never came. I called back and was told that they would re-email it to me. To this day I am still waiting for that email. I have never had this issue with this company but with  ever changing technology, it is what it is, right? I know this card will be good for some device I have. If you own a galaxy phone beware!! I have not attempted to use this in a samsung tablet so on that I cannot review.",

"It's a Micro SD card, it's 128 GB (which is amazing), and that's just about all I can say...  I do wish it was faster, because I've put 20-40GB virtual machine files on it and it took quite a while for them to copy.  I guess I'm used to SSD speeds.

It Failed. It only worked 3 months.I used it in a Galaxy S3 phone. It seems that this brand has an issue with this model.I lost the information.,
"Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version.

I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine.

This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more",

"I love my amazon prime membership. I use it to stream TV and movies, and I love that I can download content to my Fire as well. I bought a Roku a couple of years ago and it has truly changed the way I use my prime membership. Because I use it for TV and movies, it reaffirms that the new price is worth it.I had been considering buying a second Roku for a secondary TV, but when I saw this new device, I bought it right away Here are my thoughts:SET UPSo simple to set up. Including opening the package, it took me 5 minutes (I timed it). All I had to do was connect the device to the HDMI and plug it in. Then I put in my WIFI password. Because the device is so slim and small, I have it sitting under my HDTV on the console. I feel like the cords are neater there.It took an additional 38 minutes to update the software, so it did take a while to actually be able to use it. I loved that as soon as it finished loading, a short, fun and helpful startup instructional video ran.Since I bought it for myself on amazon, it was automatically uploaded with my account info.NAVIGATING AMAZON VIDEO CONTENTIt gave me the option to add parental controls in the form of a pin to my account, which I did, because I didn't want my kids to accidentally (or on purpose) buy an episode. At first I was frustrated by this, because Amazon Prime content wasn't showing up. If I tried to access something on my watchlist, I had to select other viewing options to watch via Prime. I'm still not sure why this is. Then I still had to put my pin in, which made me wonder if I was buying it. I went to settings and was able to leave the pin on for purchased content and turn it off for Prime content, which is what I want. Then it made it easier to access the prime content.VOICE SEARCHThis does work It's great. You push the button on the remote and speak the title or actor. Amazingly intuitive.APPSI added the YouTube app and it was easy to sign in to my account and access my videos. I'm sure my kids will love this.AS COMPARED TO ROKUI'm still out on this. The Roku 2 (which is the one I have) is at least twenty dollars cheaper and is what I was planning to buy for my 2nd TV. I really like the voice search feature over the Roku search. And it does seem to be faster.However, the navigation of the actual prime content isn't as easy to access as on the amazon app on the Roku. Part of it might be unfamiliarity, but it seems like it's easier to find prime content via the app on the Roku than the TV/Movie section on the Fire TV (It doesn't seem to have Prime set apart separately like on the app I use on the Roku).I do like the games availability and think my 10 year old son will enjoy it. It was one thing that caused me to buy it. He enjoys playing Angry Birds on the Roku, but that's where it ends there. It also comes with 500 coin credit to use.",
Great price for a great product works great in my new Samsung Galaxy 4 why anyone [pays full price at the cell provider is beyond me! Keep up the good work Amazon love you guys!!,
after 4 months it stopped working i got a new one form SanDisk but I'm very apprehensive to put it on my phone.,
plugged it into my Surface 2 and doubled my storage capacity.  i have had no problems with it. It is fast enough to use for videos.,
"use it on my phone and have some apps installed don it and the speed is great, havent had any issues with the brand before and noe still today!!!",
This Alexa is a super form of info with little wait time.,
I had it for a day before it died and lost all my data. Not what I expected from SanDisk or any microSD card in this case.,
"Look at this product as a portable speaker first and an Echo replacement second. The big reason to buy this over standard Bluetooth speakers is this has WiFi streaming enabled. When you are at home you can stream music with ease to it. Voice recognition is top notch and it really shines when using it with other smart home accessories. The only problem is having to tap the microphone button for it to listen to your voice. If you want bigger sound and always listening features, spend the extra money on the Amazon Echo.",
"Bought this for my Samsung Tab3.  Works great, fast and have not had a problem.  This will also work with the Samsung Galaxy S4.",
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
I have nothing to use this device with. I ordered by mistake. I'm sure it's a great product but not for me.,
"Installed in Samsung Galaxy S3.Latest Verizon stock rom supports exFAT, and you can format this your Windows PC.You can also format this NTFS and use several 3rd party apps to mount automatically. (suggest Paragon).",
"The price was great.  Since this is an SDXC Class 10 card,I expected pretty decent write speeds.  I copied about 30GB of data from my computer HD to this card and it took over 8 hours.Of course, since that was a one-time thing, I didn't really mind.  It works great in my Microsoft Surface Pro.  I just cannot believe that I could find a 64GB micro SDXC card for under $50.  The sale is over, of course, and I've not been able to find them this cheap since.I would buy another one if it were comparably priced.",
This works great with my GoPro Hero 3+. It is able to shoot at the 60 and 120p without any problems or delay.,
These things average about 50% more mbps than your standard microsd. Worth the premium? IDK. What's your time worth?However I threw a fit and ended up smashing the little guy in half. not too resilient but that's not saying anything about this little guy. The insides look like something out of a Halo video game. high technology. Just go with (2) 16gb's if you have a temper problem and not a huge need for consolidated data.,

"This card is the fastest they make right now, the 32GB size is the upper limit that many phones and devices can handle like my Droid X phone.  I actually use it in my new Rikomagic mk802 III tv adapter and it works great.",
You can't beat the value of this 32  Micro  m a cardbeliever that there is no such thing as a deal of a lifetime when it comes to electronics but for now this card really is a great value.,
"I purchased this for my go pro hero 3... Its a solid card, but unless your planning to buy several I would recommended going with the 64 gig. At the higher capture setting you can only get a little over an hour or so of video time.",
I bought this for my Samsung S4 Acitve. It fit perfectly and I have had no problems with it. The price was really reasonable for the size of GB you get.,
"Having bought 2 of the Roku 3 and I am a little spoiled. The Fire has very few or limited, outdated apps. (Mostly Amazon Apps) No HBO Go, No PBS, No TargetTicket, Showtime Anytime is out of date, (Does not list DirecTV as provider) No VUDU It does have Flixster but it loads very slow. The USB port is useless Why is even there What a let down Sending mine back Not worth 99",
Amazon Fire is misleading. I recommend staying with an Apple TV. The device is very fast and the instant play is one of a kind. The voice search is unmatched by anything on the market. The only problem with the voice search and instant play is it only works for Amazon Prime videos. That is a disclaimer that should be noted somewhere. At least in small print.,
I bought this for my Microsoft Surface rt and it works great with it. I would recommend it to anyone.,
This card will hold about 3.5 hrs of hd video on the GoPro Hero3. The adapter that comes with it works great too.,
Great deal for a great product. Recommended for anyone needing to expand the memory of their portable devices. Comes with SD adapter for use in card readers.,
"great memory card, i bought this for my phone and it works like a gem! now im just waiting to get the new galaxy S5 and then i can pop this baby into that phone!",
Using a pair of these in a Nikon P700 and D5000 cameras. The run fast and store pics just fine.,
"I bought this for my wife's new SmartPhone, so that she should never run out of space for photographs, or at least it will take her a very long time ;-)  We'll see how long filling it takes once she gets going ;-)",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
Got one for my wife's S3 and it works perfect.  The frustration free packaging is nice so I can just open the package and get right to the product.  Didn't have to do anything special...just put it in the S3 and worked immediately with no issues.,
"did not work when first inserted into my samsung galaxy tab 2 10.1 with ICS. put it in my samsung galaxy sII phone which recognized it and formatted it. then placed it back in my tablet and 57GB are available. should note that my phone was not running ICS at the time, that was yesterday and now it has ICS on it. So not sure if that matters but it does work and i now have a 64GB micro SD card that works in my tablet and pc and phone. so much for the 32GB limit.Enjoy!",
I purchased this product specifically to utilize it for my Sony Action Cam's.  The SanDisk product works well with it.  I have and not problems whatsoever.  I would recommend  this product for use with the Sony Action Cam or any camera requiring a Micro SDHC card.,
"Works, had to give a review of this since it does exactly what is it advertised to! Good buy for anyone!",
"Worked exactly as advertised, good price, happy with our purchase. Will probably wait for the 64gb version to drop a bit in price before I get one for my phone. This one was for the wife.",
"I bought this an formatted it to FAT32 so I can use it in a devices that say they only allow 32GB card.  To do this you must find a program that will format card above 32GB into FAT32.  Windows will not format anything 32GB and higher in FAT32, so try this site for a program to do it in:  [...]",
"As I just mentioned, it is both fast and efficient.  After several months of use in both my laptop and 7 inch Galaxy Tab 2, it has displayed exceptional speed and no loss of data.  I highly recommend this card for use in computing devices and/or tablets.",
"Bought these for my FineVu CR-500HD dash cam, my cam cannot take cards greater than 32GB and found this to be the most consistently performing card for my use.I now get almost double the recording content vs. the 16GB card that came with the dash cam. If you need a card with no maintenance and performs with no issues, this is the card to get.",
"Very expensive charger. I think the kindle should come with it as does all other tablets, including the fire, which is way cheaper and includes the charger for just 50. It is a pretty large charger though and doesn't fit in the kindle box with the kindle, at all.",
"I am thoroughly impressed with my Echo Dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs. a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop. The construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the Echo. This case/cover will give your Echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in, but still offer the great functionality of Alexa.",
Works great - I purchased two; one for my new cell phone and one for my new tablet.,
Great micro card for my wife's Moto Defy XT.  Lot of breathing room to install apps and take pics and vids.,
Excellent price for top rated MicroSDHC Class 10 card with adapter included. SanDisk produces very reliable memory cards have never had one malfunction.,
I have this sd card for awhile now and I would have to say its awesome. The service was great. The product got to me at a reasonable time. My overall experience is 10/10. Thanks.,
Works very well with my new Tab Pro 8.4&#34;.  Have been able to download lots of content from YouTube to watch on long flights. Will use it on any device that takes sd cards.  Very happy with it.,
"i got one for my mom she's 90 years young and she sits and listens to it all day, she;s got the amazon tap i got my draugther the dot and i got my self another tap. i just found out you can put the tap on hands free and you dont have to tap the button this made it even better. my grand kids love playing ganes with alexa. like i said every household need one",
"I bought the memory to my lumia 620 and it works. It's really faster than my previous microsd (Class 4). No complaints, i'm very happy with my purchase.",
Fits my camera perfectly and gets me about 2 hours of video at highest resolution! I love how easy it is to use and the capacity is perfect for my needs.,
I am always perfectly satisfied with SanDisk products; they are extremely reliable and suit my purposes perfectly.  This particular memory card is no exception.,
A necessity for the GoPro I bought. This little guy holds all the info I need and makes for easy use. I'd recommend this little guy for anyone getting a GoPro.,
"it is very good, thanks SanDisk,you must have it with gopro cam to get the benefit of cam, yap.",
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
"I bought this SanDisk Ultra 32gb micro SD class 10 card for my GoPro Hero 3 camera. It is able to store all my 1080p HD video, as well as .5 second time lapse still photos. I've never had a SanDisk memory card fail on me. This is a quality product!",
"Has worked flawlessly with my GoPro Hero 3 Black since I placed it in the camera. Purchased 2 top have on hand. Others have their Hero 3 cameras  &#34;Freeze&#34;, &#34;Shut Down&#34;, or write files that are not usable. I recommend this card to anyone needing a class 10 card that can handle the workload.half second timelapse, 2.7k HD video, 720p-120p video, not a problem for this card.",
Got for my phone and is awesome.  The card did short out but once contacting SanDisk they had one out to me in a week.  Super awesome customer service.  Will buy more SanDisk items when needed.,
"UPDATED - After spending quite a bit more time with the device, I would give it a 4.5 due to a few specific gaps that are a bit annoying. However, you are still getting an amazing 7 tablet, with front and rear facing cameras, a gorgeous interface, fairly snappy performance and durability, all for under 50 bucks! I cant imagine not buying these for myself and my whole family, but not a primary tablet for a techie adult by any means. For background, I have every Kindle, a couple Fires, and multiple tablets from Apple, Microsoft and Samsung. Note that my review with 5 stars considers the value equation, not just performance and how that may or may not compare to other tablets - if you are expecting this to compare to a tablet costing several times more, don't bother. But if you are looking for a great entry level tablet that does most of the things people want, this little tablet definitely delivers the value!PRICING/CONFIG: I prefer this tablet with ads and no accessories to keep the costs down. You have the option to spend more money, but I recommend against it. You can easily see the specs online, so I wont do you the discourtesy of simply cutting and pasting those here. Here is the price breakdown: 49.99 base price what an incredible price point! Or buy 5 and get a sixth one free! This puts it into reach of schools and non-profits. No sponsored screensaver (15) big deal that each time you turn it on it shows you something interesting you might want. MicroSD card (19.99 for 32GB) you probably already have one laying around somewhere. Beyond that, there is memory in the device, and you are using the cloud for storage mostly anyway. If you end up needing this, just buy one off Amazon, it certainly wont be more expensive.Read more",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
Great micro SD high speed card for digital photography (I use in Sony HDR-CX160). The 16G storage can be sufficient for a short program.,
"Allows me to store quite a few movies in my razr.  Sandisk is THE brand for memory, all of my USB memory thumb drives are Sandisk..",
"I've used many others, and this is average. Its in my son's android, and I don't really think the application its in right now is a the best way to determine its speed / performance.  Otherwise it does what i want it to.The adapter will come in handy later.",
Works perfect in Samsung Tab 2. It quadrupled my storage capability and seems to be very fast.  I would recommend to anyone,

"Ordered on April 16th, installed on my phone on April 21 and last Saturday (June 6th) on a warm Tucson day it just fell off. Landed on the car mat an all of the glue section was instantly covered in dirt. Washed it off with cool water only, let air dry and it won't stick back on. It's supposed to be washable and re-usable. Don't waste your money on this piece of trash. I expected it to last a lot longer than two months.",
"The tap has pretty good sound for a speaker this size. I also have an Amazon Dot, but would recommend you pay the extra cost and get the Tap to enjoy the better sound. It's worth it.",
"Bought this for my new Samsung digital camera. No complaints. It does what it's supposed to do, and I haven't noticed any problems with quality.",
"I am very happy with this Micro SD.  I could tell the difference in the response time in my BB curve as well as my Asus tablet.  If you want something that can transfer files Photos, Videos, and Music faster this is the Micro SD card for you. Now I will say this there are faster cards out there but not at this price.  This does the trick for my devices.  Now it you are a Professional Photographer you might want to go with the Ultra 3 Micro SD but if you are an everyday user this will work wonders for you device.",
"Started acting erratically after about a month, it's now been a little over a month and all my files are gone. Not all of them were able to be backed up. I hope I can get at least the pictures back. Glad the S4 backs up photos automatically...",
This is a device that works as advertised. It is simple and quick to set up but requires a call to the internet provider in order to obtain the necessary password. Since I never watch any netword TV except 'Fox' having movies available at all times is very satisfying.,
"Picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage. Love that it's battery powered. Never had an issue of it running out of juice. The only issue I have is with the mics, it doesn't respond to your voice as well as the Echo or Dot. Then again it wasn't really designed to listen for the Alexa command since it originally required you to ""tap"" the speaker to get it to listen.",
Works very good. I love this.,
This is a great device and so much fun to use. It is so versatile in what it can and control.,
its geniune and performs as expected in my ASUS TF300T  tablet.  Includes sd adapter and has a nice sandisk app in the play store.,
I WAS LOOKING FOR A WHILE FOR ONE HAPPY I FOUND THIS THE PRICE WAS GREAT BESTBUY WANTED DOUBLE THE PRICE FOR IT ILL NEVER BUY ON BESTBUY AGAIN ONLY AMAZON,
I bought this for my son's Samsung Galaxy S4.  He had an 8gb card but it was filled.  This has more than enough space and the speed is excellent. He told me it is very fast compared to his last card. I would recommend this for sure.,
I'm very glad that I made this purchase. I don't often bring my computer with me when I travel. I enjoy having the option of using a standard outlet to charge the Paperwhite.,
14000 reviews and counting !! Do you need any other justification to buy this one if you are looking for a microSD card?? Add to it the reliable name of SanDisk and you are left with no doubts to buy this or not!!! Also its available at almost half the actual price with Amazon (I did check the price at local sellers and no one is selling it that cheaper).Comes with a decent writing speed (good for most shooting/recording devices) and has a very very long warranty (10 years !!!). The technology may take a leap before this one stops functioning on you.Want to use it as a SD card in your camera? No problem. It comes with an adapter with which it can be used in any device that uses a SD card. That makes in two-in-one card!!!!!,
This is perfect. A lot of people were commenting that the case falls off and it's not portable. That's not the intended use of the case. It is strictly for decorative use. It look great and comes in several color options. Would definitely purchase again.,
"Hasn't even blinked in my MP3 player, and gave me loads of room for expanding my library.  I trust the SanDisk name with all my electronic gear.",
"the unit shows 0 bytes, in a PC or the phone. it keeps dismounting also. I got a replacement and it did the same thing. Not sure what is going on but it looks like a Chinese counterfeit case. I have seen this happen more and more lately. Amazon seems to be a major portal for these hings, it makes sense with a such a large retailer, they cant check everything.",
"Before using I strongly suggest to format the card, it only takes seconds. With the SanDisk I am able to transfer my images from the phone to the other phone or the tablet with no issues.My old MicroSD was from PNY when I purchased the phone they were giving the MicroSD card for free; however, it was only 2GB card. I figured that it was time to upgrade since I only had about 20MB left of space on the card, and the phone space was full due to pictures. I spend several hours doing research for a good MicroSD card.  After reading couple articles online I found that all of my devices work great with MicroSDHC.There are a lot of choices to pick from on Amazon. However, I was debating between SanDisk, Transcend, and Samsung. I started to read Samsung MicroSD card reviews, and the first reviews were from 2012 which were 1 star, at least most of them due to the card not being a class 10.  Then I looked at the Transcend card and the reviews were good., but I was not so sure about the performance test.So the third one I looked at was SanDisk, and it appears to be the best choice for my devices just because it had so many reviews. I read a lot of reviews about this SD card and I was convinced to buy it.I have downloaded SanDisk Memory Zone for all of my devices. The app provides more management functionality for complete control. It allows to manage local and cloud memory, meaning you can move files from your phone to Box, Dropbox, Google Docs, Picasa, SugarSync, SkyDrive or from the cloud storage to the phone. The application allows to secure files with a password.",
"Works great in my Galaxy SIII, allows me to both take considerable more music and video with me, while also recording more pictures and video.I haven't done speed benchmarks on the card, but when copying mp3's to it at no point did I think &#34;this is a slow piece of crap.&#34;, as I have with other SD cards previously.  The included adapter made it work directly in my laptop as well.I do recommend anyone with a memory card this large does regular backups to their PC or other media - as nice as it is to be able to take 64gb of pictures, it would make it even worse if you lost your phone and they were the only copy.",
I brought this for my wife's Samsung Galaxy S3 phone and it's work perfectly with it. It has a fast read and write speed.,
Worked fine in my Samsung S4 for one year.  Then it stopped allowing writing to the card.  Would not format even on a PC or with another device.  The data is still there but cannot be erased.,
"awesome little sd card, my phone is 32GB but I still wanted more for music and videos and this totally works great, as soon as I put it on my phone read it and also it is fast.. I am happy with my purchase..",
"When I needed more VIDEO capacity for my Canon camera, the Sandisk 32 GB Micro Card (with included Adapter) was EXACTLY the right tool for the job !!I've had several SanDisk Memory Cards in the past, with never a glitch of any kind.Highly recommended !",
I'm using this on my gopro.  I find that my new issue is not filling up the memory but running out of battery!  Thanks again!,

"Update on Dec 23 2013 - Please scroll to the very end of this review for 2 month use update. ...For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model. The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080). This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution. The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.Read more",
I bought this along with a fire tablet I purchased for my 9 year old. Fits great and does the job well as she has already dropped the tablet a few times. I would recommend this for anyone buying a fire tablet for their kids.,
"I bought this for my GoPro HD Hero 3 camera, as it was the one recommended by most buyers. I've had zero problems with the card, and the included adaptor makes it easy to transfer my videos to my PC. These things are tiny though, and thin so be careful not to bend or lose them! The $24 price is reasonable as well.",
bought for our recent GoPro purchase to hold many videos/shots. No problem with installing or viewing from chip. SanDisk is our go to product for memory cards.,
"Lots of room, enough speed and everything that I need portable is going along for the ride. No loss of data for me.",
"I have an s3 which are notorious apparently for killing sd cards. Last black friday I bought two normal (the black ones) 32 gb cards and my phone killed both. Sprint swore it was the cards but I defended Sandisk saying how would they sell me two defective cards in a row (~$16 each). I made a deal with Sprint saying if I bought a new card and the phone killed that one they would have to replace my phone and cards at no cost to me, so I bought this one and so far no problems so shame on you Sandisk. 5 stars for product, 0 stars for their greed.",
i bought this for my go pro and it works great. i can record 9 hours of video now. thats pretty sweat compared to 2 gb 19 minute videos.,
"This product works as described.  It's just not super quick.  I would recommend this product, especially, if you get it on sale.",
"Only had it a few days, but so far it seems to work fine. One thing to be aware of - the adapter came with the little slider switch in Write Protect mode. I could not write on the memory card from my laptop because of that, and almost embarrassed myself by asking Sandisk for support - the I realized what the problem was. I give 10% of the blame to Sandisk since the slider has no visual indication at all. A little dab of white ink would gave helped. But mostly, it was me :-) Anyway, just be aware of this if you use the adapter.",
"I've only had this Memory card for 3.5 weeks and it not only has recently started resetting, it intermittently loses contact with my Cell phone and the memory is lost, erasing everything on it!!!!!! Now I find out my return date has past and I'm stuck with a peice of s*** memory card that I can't do a damn thing about! Thanks a lot for nothing! I will never buy direct from here again!Also, I didn't realize I was supposed to have an adapter too? wow where the heck is that at???",
I added this to my echo collection great for on the go and around the house. I don't like that you have to tap it to activate,

"This card does not work on droid razr phones. Whenever I try to transfer files on the card, it makes the phone freeze completely.

Unbelievable room in a tiny package.  So far have been able to store and retrieve hi-def video with no problems.,
"I waited two days to set up Show to give myself a reward for working. I read the majority of the reviews already posted. I have no idea why there is even a one-star review.Setup was a breeze. My Ring Pro screen pops up brilliantly. Nest cameras, too. Played Adele at the maximum volume and sang along with the lyrics Show trickled on the screen.As far as those who boo hoo over the headlines Show displays, you can give her the voice command of DND. Problem solved. Then, just tell her to wake up.I followed the simple instructions on how to change the generic photo on Show's home screen. Easy peasy.Granted, I haven't made a video call yet.

"It's not the echo but for what I paid, it's well worth every penny",
Came withing in 2 days and the price was good. Unfortunately it was such a good deal my granddaughter decided she should have it in her phone... so I am ordering another one.,
"Does anyone really need this much space? Hard to say, after about 20GBs of pictures and 40GBs of music, I started to wonder myself, if it was really necessary. But then I realized I had forgotten about adding movies! 50GBs of movies later I can definitely say I don't need this card and really just wanted it for the fun of it, but it /is/ nice to have your /entire/ collection of music in your phone, for someone with a bigger collection then me I'm sure this card would be a God-send.",
"Any SanDisk product I've ever purchased worked very well and this one is no different.  I use this in my Sony Experia Z1S from Tmobile and I've had no problems.  SanDisk is a trusted brand, this paired with the great price and Amazon Prime eligibility, it is a no-brainer purchase if you're looking for more data for your device.",
It's a memory card and performs like it should: it stores data. I would recommend it for cameras and any other device that calls for storage with a SD card and adapter.,

Works as expected. Very fast writer. Too bad the reader I bought with the disk doesn't work as well as the disk.,

"The last few days I have been diligently shopping for a MicroSDXC card to utilize in my new smart phone. I have a long term positive experience using SanDisk cards. I quickly became confused about the differences between the so called ""Mobile"" Ultra cards and the Ultra cards. The performance specs to my ""intermediate tech experience"" eyes were virtually the same. The prices were also similar, with the ""Mobile""version slightly higher. To finally resolve my confusion I contacted SanDisk technical support. To my surprise, the ""Mobile"" version is the older, no longer manufactured version. The Ultra is the current model. So I immediately bought the current Ultra version, which very fortunately AMAZON had on sale!",

"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones.

its a sandisk ultra card. all i can say is that it records data for my go pro without problems.,
I've owned several different tablets. This one is by far the slowest. And I don't mean it's a little slower. I mean you have to wait up to 2 minutes sometimes for the apps to load onto the screen. Opening apps can be quick or take up to 3 minutes. I've had far more issues with this Fire than any of the others we've owned. If I had realized the difference in speed I would have kept my old one. It's definitely not work the larger screen. It's a crap shoot on a daily basis on how fast it will be. But even on it's fastest day it's significantly slower than the others.,
"Well, it does work and glad that it is not fake as you would get if you bought from other online stores at $50 a piece. But their max transfer speed is only at 18mb/s not 30 as advertised and I have a very decent desktop with usb3 connector.",
"Thank you for another awesome device, Amazon.My husband and I were impressed with the lack of lag and drop outs while watching movies. We have 2 of these devices and loving them both.",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"Review updated September 17, 2015As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing this review from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the 2013, 2014 and new 2015 Paperwhite, the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9. This review is for the 2015 All-New Kindle Paperwhite. The attached picture shows the 2014 Kindle on the left and the new 2015 Kindle on the right. Here is the summary of my initial impressions of the 2015 model versus the 2014 model.I am somewhat disappointed in the 2015 version as there is not a huge improvement over last years model. The Paperwhite made many improvements from its original first generation 2012 model to its second generation 2013 model, especially in the display and processor area. The 2013 model came with 2 GB storage, a wonderful display, a great battery and was the e-book workhorse. The second generation 2014 model changed by only increasing storage to 4 GB. The third generation 2015 model increased the display resolution but reduced the battery life slightly.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: A Paperwhite device, a quick-start guide and a short USB cord. Amazon still does not supply a power adapter.SIZE: Its the same identical size as the older Paperwhites. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.3 to 7.2 ounces, a fraction of an ounce, most likely because of a smaller battery.The good news is that all cases that fit the other Paperwhites will fit the 2015 version!!DISPLAY: The resolution has been bumped up to 300 ppi, equivalent to the Voyage.Read more",
"I have a lot of music (59 GB) and many videos and movies I like to take with me (I'm a video producer) so I was thrilled when I learned that the S5 would take a 128 GB chip. I've always liked SanDisk products, and this is no exception. It's now at home in my S5 with about 50 GB of free space. That means I can shoot &#34;quick and dirty&#34; videos for location scouting and other purposes with the Galaxy's excellent camera without worrying about running out of space. When I get back to the office, I can simply transfer the files to my computer and delete them from the card.",
"Bought this to store music on my phone. Works flawlessly after three months so far, no problems.In my card reader, I average 6-8 megabytes read and write to it.",
"i love this little guy its super fast and it has a lot of space for storage, just plug it in and enjoy",
"The micro SD card was extremely fast.  Writing and read files were very fast even on a slow USB 2.0 interface.  Mechanically, the card is tight in the adapter.  Needs a screw driver to get it back out of the adapter.  Tried on another two adapters with the same results, tight fit.  If user plan to use this as a normal size SD card, it is an excellent card.  If one plan to switch between &#34;phone&#34; (micro SD card) and camera (normal size SD card), then the tight fit might be a problem.  Vender service was excellent.  shipment was faster than expected.  Would buy it again even with the tight fit.  It was an excellent value for a very fast card (camera can shoot burst mode without slowing down to write to card).",
"I Finally took the plunge and got this guy. I was worried it wouldn't work with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1.  After reading some of the reviews how people 'got it working', I finally decided to give it a try.First of all, I want to say there was no 'getting it to work'.  I put it in and it recognized it immediately.  I didn't have to pre-format it or do anything hokey with it.  I used the tablet to format it anyways (there might be some optimization things that can happen), but it work!  Now, I can load all my songs and movies onto one card as opposed to keeping them on two and swapping between them.Hey Samsung, why don't you make a tablet that holds more than one microSD card?  I'd buy it.*********** Update **************I bought another one to go in my Galaxy S5 for $40.  Even though the 128GB will work in the phone, I couldn't see paying literally 3x more for only twice the memory.  So these work great!",

This is my first foray into the microSD card world. I bought this for my GoPro Hero3 white.Pros:- comes with an adapter for easy downloading.- simple to format right out of the box.- reads/writes just fine with no errors.Cons:- the adapter has no spring return like the devices you instert the card into - removing the card from the adapter can be a pain.Overall it's great and does what I need it to do.Hope that helps...,
"I bought two of these - one to go in a Galaxy Tab 8.4 and another to go in a Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. I've been using both, and haven't had a problem with either of them so far.",
"Bought both this and a similar Transcend Premium 300X 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS for a couple of G1WH dash cams.  Both work well with the cameras.  The key is you need cards compliant with UHS 1 or better.  Look for the U with a 1 or a 3 inside it on the card for these cameras.  The Transcend is rated slightly faster but the cameras seem to like either equally well.  When I purchased this Transcend and the SanDisk were within pennies of each other, so aside from slight price and speed differences, there's not much to recommend one over the other.  And so long as you get at least a UHS 1 card, the same can be said for other manufacturers such as G.Skill, Kingston, or others.",

"Great price, shipped fast, and well packaged. I have an incredible amount of space in my Raspberry Pi now! Class 10 is the way to go...",
"I use these with my GoPro Hero3 and to date I haven't had any issues with them. I have two of these and they record about 8 hours of video each, so theres more than a day worth of filming you can do these.",
Found this card at a reasonable price on Amazon and purchased to replace a several-year-old 16G no-name card that passed away. Have no issues so far and being a SanDisc expect many years of use in my smartphone. 32G size allows for plenty of media space without clogging up phone's internal memory.,
Just popped it in and moved some apps to the card and works great.  Video is handled quickly and all apps start fast.,
"It is a 32 gb micro flash card.  It was bought for an Optimus Ultimate cell phone.  It works just the way it is supposed too.  It gives me added space for pictures, and comes with the full size adapter.",
"One of the benefits of having an Android phone is being able to have external storage. I popped this in my phone, moved my apps over, and added some FLAC, movies, and more.I added a selection of movies, and then never watched them. Then I was on a flight across the Atlantic and everyone fell asleep around me, and I remembered that I had added all these HD movies! That alone justified the purchase.Do yourself a favor and add some extra storage to your phone/whatever.",
they took almost 3 gigs for themselves(formatting purposes) but am satisfied till i need to take my s4 up to 64gigsno issues to report,
"Okay not limitless but close enough. I have this in a 32GB phone and combined, that's quite a bit of available storage. I have tons of photos, music, and entire seasons of TV shows.It's great to never get a warning about having low storage. I can take the max resolution photo option with my phone and shoot 4k videos without having to worry about running out of space.It's also speedy at transferring files to and from my laptop.",
"I bought it to run XBMC, and it works great. I had no experience loading custom apps on Android boxes, but had XBMC running in about 5 minutes. It runs all my videos well. All the other Amazon functionality is a nice bonus. All in all very happy.",
"Very fast, this is the best one you can get. I use it on my asusprime and I could see the difference with the previous one.",
"I wanted a place to store my music on my phone. This card works great. I haven't tried the adapter yet, though.Also, so much storage!",
Not much to say about the memory card. It's doing its job as expected. Bought mainly because it can store a lot information.,
great memory card.  i have trusted sandisk since it came out with memory products.  they work harder to keep innovating.,
If you're getting this card it means you're 1337 like me.  Or at least you aspire...Carry on young diamond...carry on.,
"If there is anyone out there curious if this works on Garmin's GPSMAP line of handhelds, then yes! All 32GBs are recognized, and I am maxing this baby out with every map I can get my hands on! No issues at all.Some forums may have you believe there is a 4GB limitation, but there simply isn't (FAT32 - which is the format of the card, has a 4GB limit on FILE SIZE, but that's fine as all individual Garmin maps are under 4GB)",
Best card for an 808 #26. Gives you 2.5 charge cycles worth of recording without having to dump memory. But ya 32gig is better!,
"I've got a number of SanDisk brand products.  None has ever failed me over the 10+ years I've used them.  That's saying something these days in electronics.This card is performing well, and keeping up with the data storage devices I am using it for (one video recorder, one scanner).  Somehow, I would expect nothing less, but then again it is good to know that quality is consistent.",
Good price. Works as expected. Nothing much more to say abt a MicroSD card honestly. The frustration free packaging is really good. Definitely better than the retail packaging.,
"Worked perfectly right out of the box, and seems to be a lot faster than the old class 10 that were manufactured by SanDisk, or others for that matter.",

"This card has met my requirements. I wanted a 32 GB card with an adapter and I wanted the faster card and it is a C10. It worked out of the box with no problem. I bought 2 of them at the same time, one for mine and one for my wife's Smartphone--Samsung Galaxy Centura. I am satisfied with both of them.",
Utilizing for my GOPRO Hero3 Black....no issues at all filming and transferring to my computer.  Good transfer rate and glad I got the 64GB for all the filming / photos done.,
"Make sure to format to FAT32 to be compatible with both AOSP and Touchwiz roms. If you're not running any AOSP roms, just pop the card in. It will be formatted to exFAT automatically. I formatted to FAT32 with guiformat in PC and haven't had any issues. *Optional* Search the xda-developer forum for instructions on swapping internal SD card with external SD card and give your phone 64GB of ""internal"" space for those apps that won't move to SD.",
Using this is my Surface Pro. Works great. &#128522; You have to Love Amazon,

"I have exclusively used Sandisk Extreme cards in my pro photography gear for years and they have NEVER let me down. This one is a dud, though. I plugged it in, let my phone format it, and then start copying to it. Everything copied just fine, but after I got done, that's when it started acting up.If I had my phone plugged into the computer and was using it as a storage device, I got tons of CRC errors and/or messages saying that I needed to format the card before using it. The phone would come up from time to time saying that I had inserted a blank card. If I reboot the phone, it works fine for a little bit, and the errors would start again. I thought maybe it was the way the phone formatted, so I tried to format it on the computer, but that didn't help anything.Very frustrating! Thankfully I've had it for 2 days before the trouble started, so it's going back to Amazon for a refund and I'll have to find a more reliable card for my phone.",
"I purchased the card in the Sandisk packaging, so I am pretty sure it is genuine. I tested it with various programs on the web that apparently can detect whether they are fakes or not. This one turned out to be a real Sandisk card. The card came formatted with FAT32.I read on the web about these micro SDs, and apparently they are not as fast as the full SD card version. I borrowed my brothers Sandisk 32gb full SD card to make comparison tests. Here are my official/unofficial test results using DiskBench V2.6.2.0 and H2testw 1.4 test. I will give the results as an ""overall"" result, because after testing these cards over and over with speed writes and reads, the results get mixed and varied to a big degree... much larger than I expected, but the numerous tests showed me a ""general"" trend. The trend is that the full SD cards do write faster than the MicroSD card. But, also remember that the microSD had to be put into an adapter to do the test on my PC while the fullSD card was put into the computer reader directly.These are just my averages, but:Small file writes:Both SD cards wrote at close to 10mb/sec. The microSD was less consistent in the tests and sometimes dropped to 8mb/sec.Small file reads:Both SD cards read at close to 20 mb/sec at their fastest.Large file copies to card:MicroSD wrote at 3.5mb/sec while the fullSD wrote at about 4mb/secLarge file reads copies from card:MicroSD was 10mb/sec while the fullSD read at about 14mb/sec.My conclusion:My tests were by no means official for this card and showed much variance dependent on file size of the reads and writes, but the fullSD card was faster in many cases, but equal to microSD in most cases. The small file writes and reads showed that they are similar enough. But, my only concern is with large file writes.... is 3.5 mb/sec good enough for rapid photography on a high pixel camera? I don't know. I have had no problem using these cards with H264 movie capture for hours. I am surprised that 3.5 mb/sec is enough.Also, never during the huge file copies to the card did I get any noticeable heating of the card itself, by touch even for an hour. I've noticed that it has been a complaint from many people on the web, some stating that they felt they might burn themselves. I copied files that took more than an hour with no noticeable temperature change, other than, perhaps a couple of degrees. Of course, this was on a PC and not installed in a camera.The card performs well for video work, and appears to meet many other tests performed by other people. I never saw a read close to 30 mb/sec... they were very consistent at 20 mb/sec at the highest performance.I would get the card again, if the price were right.",
"Card works great, but the adapter was too loose to make full contact with the micro card to facilitate connectivity to the card reader.  Minor issue since I have several adapters... But it's worth noting.",
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
Used this in my S4 and in my new S5. Transfer speed is good and it is still performing well after almost a year. I haven't been disappointed with a SanDisk product yet.,
"i've been buying SanDisk for awhile, but I have yet to experience how durable and fast they are until now!when accessing video or photos on my phone, they do not hesitate to load. (all due to the memory card for being highly efficient)and for the price I got them for were amazing!I highly recommend!",

"This SDHC is fast. Great for cameras, the pictures take nothing to record and the next shot is quick and easy. I use it with Raspberry Pi, that needs fast media. Works perfectly.",
"Worked perfect, understandable that only 59gb is usable as this is the case with all memory items I have ever dealth with.",
Card works fine.  Using in a wireless IP camera that records 720p.  Can think of much else to write... it's a memory card and it works :),
This is the best in its kind... works really fast. beside I like the color of this micro sd card,
"Good stuff! Works with my newly bought Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch, Wi-Fi)  no problems at all. I am happy.",
very usefull to use in the phone also they come with the adpator to SD i will remomend it :),
"I for one have not bought into Google's, or anybody else's, idea that streaming everything is so great.  With all the regressive data caps and sketchy throughput, I never want to rely on something being available to me online.  Much better to have it local.  And with this new card I can finally pack all of my music (~56GB), all of my photos, dozens of reference ebooks, and a few videos to boot and still I have around 9GB free as breathing room for my podcatcher.  The only real bummer with this card is the speed.  Just as I got acclimated to SanDisk's 64GB Extreme Plus level of speed, going back to ordinary class 10 speed that this card has is a little painful.  Luckily playing music or even playing videos doesn't oversaturate the read performance.  What WILL trip you up however is doing a straightforward copy or move operation while you're listening to something.  This card does not seem to handle multiple simultaneous operations without something going awry.  So long as you understand it's limitations and you can live with them, the enormous amount of storage you can pack into your phone or tablet is very welcome.So far I've used one of these in a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 N7100, LG G Pad, and a Sony Xperia Z1 Compact - all with success.",
I purchased this card as memory storage for my Asus TF700 tablet and it works like a charm. Highly recommended!,
Used this card to upgrade the memory the kids Tab 2 then it was moved to the kids S3. Thanks.,
Have always had good experiences with SanDisk products.  This was priced well.  I have installed it in my wife's cell phone and it was immediately  recognized.  Not quite sure about the features this chip is supposed to have but for the amount of memory it was a good deal - extra features or not.,
Excellent card. It is currently installed in my Samsung GS3 and works flawlessly. Highly recommended but make sure your phone/device will handle the size; some don't like cards &#62; 16GB.,
"I really dont have much to say about SanDisk's cards. They work as intended, I never had a problem with them.",
The best there is under this category. make sure you research before you buy this card for your phones. Lots of Android phones still dont make use of the UHS-1 technology for transfer rate. You will still get good transfer rate but not the best.,
It works great and added more memory for my LG phone.  Sandisk brand is very trust worthy.I recommend it highly.,
"Arrived DOA but Amazon sent me another one right away and it is perfect. I use it with my GoPro HERO 3 and it is a must if shooting 1440 or better video in order to keep up.Do you need 64gb? Maybe, maybe not but you do need Class 10 so buy it and never look back!",
I have two of these that I use in my Asus Infinty tablet.I have one in an SD adapter in the dock and the other in a MicroUSB adapter in the dock.,
"I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S4 because it had little available memory on board. Unfortunately the phone doesn't allow for the user to move apps to the sd card, but that isn't the card's fault, it's the phone's fault.

"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysOctober 1, 2012Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're glad you're enjoying your Kindle Fire HD, and we are particularly excited to see your encouraging comments regarding the display and sound quality, as the team worked really hard to build an excellent experience. We wanted to answer your question about storage. HD content is much larger than SD content, which is why Kindle Fire HD starts at 16GB. On average, a 90 minute HD movie is 2GB and a 45 minute HD TV episode is 0.9GB. With your 16GB Kindle Fire HD, you can have up to 6 HD movies or 13 HD TV episodes. This number will vary depending on the other items you have stored or installed on your device. We hope this information helps.Thanks, The Kindle Team",

Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
"Very nice upgrade for my phone, gives it plenty of space for allot of games. and if you wondering yes this is compatible with a Samsung galaxy s4.",
Lets me choose the type of music I love. Can even go to the beach with me using my sling.,
I own both 64 and 32GB cards for use in my phone as well as GoPRO cameras. They have been reliable and worked well right out of the box with no problems. No complaints at all.,
"the speaker voice quality is terrible compare the similar size my logitech UE BOOM.the price is too high, even I got on promotion with $79",
I prefer spending the extra $70 or $80 to get the echo,
I use the SanDisk products for long time now. They never failed me! They have an amazing speed writing and reading and also long life durability.,
"Use it (with the included adapter) as a spare card for my Panasonic FZ200 Lumix camera and as a quick and easy temporary backup drive for my MacBook Pro laptop (which has a standard SD slot). Also use it to make a quick transfer of files between the laptop and an iMac. Works exactly like a full-size SD card for these purposes. Very fast and reliable data transfers. And the special price from Amazon made these cards less costly than the standard 32 GB card at the time.UPDATE: I have changed the star rating from a 5 to a 4. This micro card worked fine for about three months and then suddenly began to disappear from the laptop finder. It still shows up and works fine when mounted in the desktop iMac. But often it will not mount in the laptop. This could be a problem with the laptop and if that turns out to be the case, I will restore this to a 5-star rating.",
"Put this in my Samsung Active phone, works great.  My first chip started acting up so I needed to put in a new memory card.  Works just as fast as the on board memory, loads photos, videos, music really fast.",
"I needed extra storage in my Garmin for additional topo maps and routes, and this card fits the bill. It comes with a standard SDHC adapter, as most microSDHC cards do. Plenty of space for extra files on the GPS. Satisified with the purchase.",
Purchased the replacement controll because the original stopped working. Ordered the replacement in November and it also stopped working for no apparent reason. I changed the batteries twice with no luck. It was great for the three months it lasted. However it ONLY lasted 3 months. Unfortunately my return date expired 2 weeks ago. I Dowloaded the remote app and it consistently looses wifi conectivity (home wifi network works perfectly on all my other phone apps),
"I bought this to upgrade my phone micro SD, works great and lots of storage. I have not been able to test the speed of the transfer as google has chosen to turn against their customers and disable any ability to connect phones to PCs in a normal since.",
"I got this because the GoPro Hero3 doesn't come with any memory cards whatsoever.Works great, especially for 4K recording on the Hero3 Black Edition.These things are so small though, easy to lose if you don't keep it in the camera, or in the Adapter.Super Fast Download with a USB 3.0 Memory Card Reader.",
I purchased this for my Samsung Galaxy lllS.  I never have to worry about running out of storage capacity.  Thousands of songs don't even make a dent.,
"I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass.",
I use it to hold files from my computer and transfer files from other computers it works good for this task and is quick. I would recommend this plus the price isn't bad.,
"As an owner of various models of Roku and Apple TVs, I didn't really need yet another streaming device, But, I decided to give it a try. It works great. I do like the voice search feature. We tried watching some of our favorites like Midsommer Murders. All of the seasons and episodes showed up which was nice. But only a few of the earlier seasons were watchable for free, and a few of the more recent were available for 5.99, but most were unavailable. That happened to several other BBC series that we tried to watch. However, the movies we have watched streamed without a hitch with good picture and sound.",
Truly amazing combination of portability and ease of use and good sound.,
"I've now bought 5 of these cards I like them so well.  I take a lot of pictures in RAW, often times filling one of the 64GB cards up in a day or less.  They are fast and very handy due to the small size.",
"I snagged this for my cell phone. I upgraded from an old 2gb SD card I've been refusing to replace for the last 4 years. The old card does not specify the class, and it was the cheapest I could get; so I have a feeling it was the slowest . Anywho, I plugged this card in and transferred 27 songs from my PC to phone in about 20 seconds! On my old card that would have taken around 2 minutes. If you haven't upgraded your card, (because you're a cheap miser) like me, you are definitely missing out!",
"Major fan, didn't buy this because of protection, bought it cause it will blend in to my decor. It is not a skin, so it's not skin tight. Yes it's loose but how often will you grab it and move it. Me maybe once every year.",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"No issues so far, stores a lot of video.  Not too expensive and no issues with quality or speed.  Works fine with my gopro camera.  Highly recommend.",
"Bought this one for the hubbys GPS, Works just great haven't heard any complaints out of him since I installed it. :) thank you",
"I havent done speed tests, but this sits in my tablet and lets me store music with easy. It is fast enough to stream HD video from.",
"I got this for my new GoPro Hero3 Black edition and it has worked without a hitch.  Even in the highest setting I get over 2 hours of recording time, and the price per Gb was extremely reasonable.",
"I bought two of these at different times.  Both of them had the retail packaging with the Android on them and the model number matched the packaging.The first one was 32GB.  I tested this out with dd on my built-in SD card reader on my MBP and on a GFR204SD USB device and couldn't get more than 8 MB/s average write speed.  Would bounce up and down between 6 and 10.  The Class speed is supposed to be the minimum, not the maximum.  R/W off the HDD was above 20, so that wasn't the bottleneck. Neither is UHS compliant, but I should at least be able to get the Class 10 rating out of this.  Read @ 30 MB/s is pretty accurate.The second one (64GB) I tested by just watching Activity monitor to see if it was in the ballpark.  Bounced between 8 and 10 copying from a hard drive or a RAM disk.  Sounds like probably Class 10.  Read speed to RAM disk was about 24 MB/s.",
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
"I should have done some research before buying the Tap. I would have rather had the upgraded version that is voice activated. Also, I thought it would be more like Siri where you can ask anything. Alexa's answer to most questions is, ""I don't understand the question."" The Bluetooth speaker works fine.",
These cards have worked flawlessly in cameras mounted on an offroad race car.  They capture HD video without stutter. I highly recommend them for this purpose.,
This is a great cover. It turns the device on and off by opening and closing and works as a great stand with it either vertical or horizontal. It also adds very little to the size or weight of the tablet. I absolutely recommend it!,
Update 12/26/2016: No longer will pair with 2nd generation firetv since reset/update. It did still pair with 1st generation firetv I have in another room. Was working fine with my 2nd gen until I reset it after having external memory problems - Orignal Review: Works and pairs quick with Fire TV just no voice search. My wife likes her own Amazon remote so this works good for us at half the price of the Fire TV remote sold here. My only concern is how small it is but hopefully that won't be a problem.,
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
"why worry about the packaging.  THis was the best I could find at the time for a name brand class 10 micro sdhc card.  Came with basic packaging and  a full SD card to adapt, which is what I needed.Works great, speed tests show excellent speed for video recording.",
"I use this product with the GoPro 3 Black Edition. It works fantastic, even at 2.7K resolution, and imports very fast, especially over USB 3 card readers. I almost always go with SanDisk these days for flash RAM; they invented much of it and it shows.",
"I have two of these, one for each of our smartphones and they work great. Ultras far surpass the basic microSDs",
"It is very fast , I like it And I think if you have one you will like it I think.",
"Ultra fast delivery.Fast performance, and compatible with my samsung phone, my portable speaker sharkk, and my PC.I recommend it. I trust Sandisk lot as the best brand in sd memory...",
perfect,
Using this with my mini MP3 player and plinking songs onto it worked flawlessly.  Now my 4gb player is a 20gb player.,
Great for travel. It is very loud for its size. Over all I love it.,
"I was working with a three of these cards using the included adapter, and thought they were slower than they should be.  I just bought a full size Sandisk Ultra 16GB class 10 (all the same specs except size theoretically) for a different project, and it writes over twice as fast on the same computer! The write speed on this card is between 7 and 10 MB/s, the read seems to be 35MB/s, compared to the full size card with write speed of 22 to 25MB/s and a read speed of 42MB/s (this is from an imaging program, not a benchmark program, so it's not checking different sizes of transfer and the like).  Compare that with a Transcend 4 GB Class 4 card, the write speed is nearly identical (7 to 9MB/s), while the read speed on the class four is 12 to 13MB/s, significantly slower, as expected.The read speed is good, but the write speed is abysmal!  If it says ""Class 10"", it should be somewhat close to the Class 10 spec.I'm returning them.",
"excellent quality, excellent speed. no complaints here. very easy to use, reliable and the red stripe on the front makes it easy to find on a crowded desk",
"Good product, no problems. I have this installed in my Samsung Galexy III. works well even in super HD video.",
"Have only transfered some pictures and music so far. My S3  Galazy had no problems recognizing the card...hear a lot of rumors about memory cards not working, having to format first, etc., but this one worked from me right out of the box.The included Adapter is also good when I want to use with my computer(s) for slide shows since MicroSDHC are not supported by many if any..just to small.",
Fast recording/downing speed. You can't go wrong wit this. It also can be used with my smartphone.I would recommend this to a friend.,
I used this for a Motorola Droid X for music files. loading the files seem to be a little herky jerky but once on there they played fine. Not sure the problem is with the memory card  or the phone. I am using The Amazon app or the Motorola app that came with the phone.,
"Never had a problem with any sd cards prior, and always had a good track record with sandisk products.Card was working great at first, used exclusively in my Samsung galaxy S3. Enjoyed the extra space(got the 32gb card) and transfers were pretty quick. I started to see (about a month ago) that the phone would randomly give me ""sd card unexpectedly removed"" error maybe once a week. The last 2 weeks, I also started seeing (frequently) ""sd card safe to remove"" randomly pop up at least once a day as well as the ""unexpected"" removal error every few days. Today the card stopped reading all together.The card was first inserted w/ the phone off, when I bought it. Although I never formatted it, it worked properly. I also never removed the card from the phone in order to possibly corrupt it from improper removal, so the card just seems to have died of it's own accord. I never thought to check it's temperature after transferring large files so I'm not sure if I had the same issue as another reviewer.Contacted Sandisk, waiting for reply. If they replace the card and it works well, I will revise this review.UPDATE: 2-28-13got a replacement card after about a week and a half, Sandisk supplied a shipping label for me which is always a plus. I've had the replacement in my S3 for 3.5 months now and still going strong. I've also used it with the adapter in my goPro. Card is working well and hopefully it continues to do so. Updated to 4 stars since I haven't had a single problem with this card (the first one started showing issues fairly soon after installing). Maybe there was just a bad batch of the card for spell there.",
"This is exactly as advertised, which is better than some other memory cards and drives. If you need a 32 GB MicroSDHC card, this will definitely work. Comes with a standard SD card adapter, too.",
Needed this to put into my new tablet. This is exactly as described and works great no complaints . would recommend to others and the price was good too.,
"I used this in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.0, and transfer rates are pretty good when going straight through USB. It does act a little peppier however when plugged straight into a card reader.",
"The remote seems to function as the previous generation but the lack of a magnetic holster is a major disappointment. Having a place to park the remote was such a fantastic feature. At first, the Echo came with a remote (and holster). Then, I had to buy a remote separately with my second Echo, but it still came with the holster. Now, I have to buy the remotes for another Echo and a Dot and they don't have the holsters. Rather than raising the price or at least offering a choice, I feel like the quality is being stripped down with each new generation. I still like the Echoes okay, they fill a need, but I am worried about Amazon's choices in slowly cutting away the extras.",
I've used this card for about 3 months now and have not had a bit of trouble.  I notice to delay while the phone writes to the memory after taking pictures or shooting full HD video.,
"Good memory card, a gift given to junior partner, after receiving very beautiful, beautiful packaging, received a big surprise, do not know how to evaluate it.",
"Installed this in an LG smartphone without incident and it has been working without as hitch ever since.  More words cannot express my lack of emotion for it, but they do make the review long enough to qualify.",
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
"The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.br /br /My overall impression of the device is good.br /br /The good:br /I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.br /br /The so-so:br /The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more",
"So when I moved into my house last year, I made the obligatory call to TWC for internet and cable TV. The bundled me into a 200 dollar per month bill which includes 30 Mbs internet (in theory -- in reality, I never see that), telephone (which I don't use because I have Verizon home phone connect, and TV with whole house DVR, all the premium channels (which I never watch), HDTV etc.After losing my job and having Time Warner get extremely nasty because I chose to spend what 200 bucks I had left on food and gas rather than paying them, AND the fact that they have THE WORST SERVICE (I had to swap out my box and waited in line for over an hour just to swap it out and then when the new box didn't work, wait yet another hour in line to get a 3rd box), I have decided NO MORE TWC.Amazon Fire TV is the corner stone of my plan to cut the cord. I've only had it for awhile tonight but I am so far blown away. The voice recognition works flawlessly (ok -- 1400 reviewers here... raise your hand if your first search term was Porn -- yeah, I'm immature) Regardless of what inappropriate word or attempts to baffle the system my teenage son and I threw at it, it recognized EVERYTHING (with the exception of his Latin -- ok, Amazon fire doesn't recognize Latin ... but neither do I)Went to the YouTube app because that is a part of my plan to ditch TWC -- could I play shows that were on YouTube that I currently watch via cable. Check. Paired with my computer (a mac), I just searched for the video that I want, hit play on the computer and it automatically is displayed on my TV.I've only had it unboxed for 1 hour so haven't tried Netflix or Hulu etc yet but one of the key activities I do a lot of is watching VOD from Amazon and it is SOOOOO much easier to do it using this device that via my BluRay player. Picture quality (even of standard def YouTube videos is nearly as good as cable).The next step of my plan to ditch TWC is getting Fiber Optic DSL installed. Once that has occurred, I will be going from a 200 dollar per month monopoly to 55 bucks per month plus whatever I choose to spend on renting movies etc on demand. AND, I never have to wait in line for hours to swap out hardware that I'm renting from the cable company...So for half the cost of 1 months worth of Time Warner, I'm going to be able to preserve what little is left of my sanity (which isn't much, given that I tried testing this out with bad words like a kindergartener) and the most fun I have had in awhile is listening to the cable customer service rep spend nearly an hour in trying to talk me out of not leaving (HIM: what if we gave you everything you have now for 160 Then would you stay ME: No... if you could provide the same level of service for 40 bucks less than you have been for the last year, why didn't you just do it then rather than making me pay over 40 bucks a month more than I needed to HIM: What if I bumped up your internet bandwidth to the next tier for free ME: Because I'm not even getting the advertised speed as it is)Sorry, TWC -- you are no longer a monopoly. There is another game in town. Thank you Amazon for giving me that ability to cut the cordp.s. (BTW, based on my little Porn experience, I will DEFINITELY be setting up the parental controls)NCJAR",
Works awesome in my galaxy s3. Fast as could be and so much storage for music and pictures. Copys music in record time! Love the price and the product.,
No complaints as yet.....It came with an adapter as advertised. I wished that I had purchased two instead of one.,
I installed this micro sd in my Asus TF300 Transformer and it worked even though the tablet only supports up to 32GB. This added 60 GB of usable space.,
"Seriously a flawless, portable, smart, multipurpose gadget. Add this to the incredible Flash Sale price and I'd have been a fool to pass it up. Fast charge, balanced tuning, easy to pair and did I mention highly portable? The cradle is a sweet design too. The only beef I have is that YOUR BLUETOOTH IS PAIRED screaming at you when syncing. Own one of these-",
Delivery was on time and the device worked perfectly for my Microsoft Surface Pro. I needed extra memory for my Surface and this 64G was perfect.,
"I purchased this to increase the memory of my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.  Just placed it into the slot, was instantly recognized and thus saving my internal memory and increasing the memory of my device. Price was the best, I went to several sites and price closest was $98.  Shipped through my prime and got it in 2 days.  I have seen no issues with this card and am very happy with the purchase.",
"Couldn't wait to test it when I got home. Yes, the capacity is 128GB but shows less due to binary code. I managed to stuff 53 Hi-Def movies on to this. That is just insane. Speed is pretty good too. I managed 17MB/sec write and 45MB/sec read using a USB3.0 reader. This is for files 64KB or bigger. It slows down substantially with smaller files - typical for SD cards and thumb drives.Great warranty and only a small premium over 2 x 64GB cards.No regrets - highly recommended if you can get it at a decent price.",
"This is a fast card that I trust more than the off-brands not to die. Sandisk has also lowered their prices to be more in line with the competition. All in all, this is a great card at a good price.",
"I was really excited when this came out I have a Mac Air and a lot of music and film on it so the ability to stick this in my MiniDrive was great, it was that or buy a 128GB MiniDrive Air which is like $30 more that this and I already had a MiniDrive.  Problem is its not very fast, not fast enough, my girlfriend has a new 128GB MiniDrive and it runs way faster than this in my old adapter and new sandisk 128.  Its great though 128gb in this little chip glad its out cause now its just a matter of time before they make it better.Thanks",
I got this micro sd card strictly to hold music on my HTC One M8. I was able to fit approx 840 albums ripped at 192kbps vbr in AAC format using dBpoweramp. Couldn't ask for anything better. 5 stars.,

got it for my samsung galaxy 3 comes with a free app dont need to buy a card for it tho just search sandick on play store,
"I bought the 64GB MicroSD card at Best Buy because I needed one for my Microsoft Surface Pro. It provides all the space I need and for people who need a lot of space (videos, Quick Books, picture editing, games, etc.) this card is the one for you. If you don't need that much space, consider buying one for cheaper with a little less memory.NOTE: Be aware that this is a MicroSDXC format card. While most new computers support this format, many of the older computers do not (This includes all but a few tablets and smartphones). Before buying this, MAKE SURE your computer, tablet, or smartphone is compatible. If it is not, it will not work, period. For others who claim that the card doesn't work no matter what they try, chances are their machine cannot support MicroSDXC format.",
"A fine product.  I've been using mine for over a year now, and it's never punked out on me.  I just bought another one, to use as a spare.  Delivered on time, reliable, priced fairly.",
Perfect in every sense.  I use it mainly for accessing my music and since I upgraded to this MicroSDHC I have found my Samsung Galaxy S3 has no lag in playback and document storage retrieval is quick,

"Bought my Amazon Fire to take better advantage of Prime video and my wife's Netflix account. It's great Easy to set up, the voice search works really well. Love the simplicity and for us it was the perfect way to add streaming media to our main TV.",
I have always purchased SanDisk products. This works alright it went bad in 2 months and sandisk replaced it. I have not had any issues with the replacement that Sandisk sent.,
"If you like the Kindle Fire HD then you will love the Kindle Fire HDX. The new device runs three times faster, is lighter in weight, and the battery lasts slightly longer. The sound quality on this device is excellent and the display quality is absolutely stunning. Below are some of the features to expect from the Fire HDX. BUILD QUALITY---There is NO blue haze on the 8.9 HDX.---The build quality is excellent.---Auto contrast is good (not buggy).---Operating system is very intuitive except after downloading free prime videos to watch offline. If you remove the videos from your Carousel then, from the video menu, you must go to the left side bar, and click *downloads* to see your videos. PRIME DOWNLOAD ISSUES (free video download limitations)Prime members can download selected Prime Instant Videos to watch when not connected to the internet. There are major restrictions imposed on prime videos as listed below.---Not all Prime titles are available for download.---Most popular prime titles are NOT available for download.---There is a max of 25 titles that can be downloaded free at any one time.---Prime titles have a viewing period.---Viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the video, or 15-30 days (which ever comes first).---After the viewing period expires you need to reconnect to the internet.---Titles can be downloaded to only two separate devices at a time.---If you exceed the device quota then you must delete one of the titles before adding to another device.---There is no way to know which titles can be downloaded unless you have the HDX (amazon does not place a banner on the titles other than to say PRIME).Read more",
29.71 G  appeared upon installing. I'd say it worked as excepted and wished. 5 stars quality. worth the money there.,
"I wanted a 64GB card for my Samsung Galaxy Note II.  I've learned my lesson about buying from that well-known auction site we all know, and getting fake cards there.  I've always had good experiences buying memory cards from Amazon, and always got genuine stuff.  This card was recognized by my phone right away, mounted, and formatted perfectly.  I have a ton of music on it, and some videos, and still have about 12 GB free.  I feel like I got my money's worth!",
Disk is very small and it fits into one that fits your computer. So far it has enough room to store my driving time for the day.You then can download everything into your computer for viewing.,
"This new KFHD replaces last year's basic Kindle Fire. Although it has some cool new features, it lacks a camera, microphone, and HDMI port. For this reason, I'm glad I kept my 2012 model since it does have these 3 features! Here are my initial impressions of the 2013 Kindle Fire HD: I like the placement of the on/off volume buttons. Being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one. I never cared for the carousel (this is what you see when you turn your Kindle on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed), and now there's an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead, and the apps/books can be rearranged to your liking. I was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar (which is now being called home). I don't know why Amazon removed this option, and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel. But you can still bookmark your favorite web pages YouTube videos for easy access. When I play songs purchased from Amazon's MP 3 store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style. Nice feature, but it doesn't work on every song. This device has a cool new feature called Quick Switch, which allows us, when reading or using an app, to bring up recently accessed items with a swipe instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one.In terms of sound, I find it to be tinny and not as rich as it is on the original KFHD. But you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds. Ironically, music sounds muffled unless you hold the device in landscape mode with your hands covering the speakers. Holding it this way projects the sound out to you.Read more",
"I purchased 2 of these, 1 for my HTC Incredible phone and the other for use in a key chain storage device. Both of these cards run very very hot.  After copying over 4GB of files, it was almost scalding to the touch.  But both have been reliable with only a few issues of reading them, both times in the thumb drive adapter, so that may have been at fault and not the card itself.",
I bought this for my galaxy note II and worked very good. Had no problem formatting and mounting.  Have copied lost of music on it and so far no issues.,
"I was taking a tour in Hangzhou China and while I was shooting with my Canon 6D, the card out of sudden crashed. My camera won't recognize the card and it showed ""card reading error"". I had more than 2000 photos in it including the trip in Beijing and Xi'an. I was not able to cover those photos even with the common flash memory recovery softwares. I may have to send it to Sandisk subdivision LC Technologies to recover those photos, for the 64 gb they are asking for $325, regardless how much photos they can recover.Lesson learned: for important shoots, use 32 SDHC card, they are so far the most stable SD cards out there. I spent over $10K for this vacation and most of these valuable memories are gone. Thanks a lot Sandisk! I wish I could give negative stars if Amazon allowed me to.",
Responsible seller. Excellent product,
I like the voice search and speed of this unit. The things i don't like is that i have to keep uninstalling apps to be able to keep on using this thing. The fire TV does not even come close to the app selection for watching TV compared to the Roku. So if you are looking at a TV watching device buy a Roku.,
"Almost like reading a real book. Don't is crisp, sharp and easy to read. I've held out from buying a reader for years because I could never quite get past the fact it wasn't a book. With this new kindle I don't even notice, I am immediately immersed. Wildly better than I expected.",
Works really well with echo and is really neat and fun,
"I've been using this  in my Sony TSX300 camera and have had no problems with quality, speed or function.  S far it works great.  Much cheaper here than at Best Buy",
Yee so this is the maximum space allowed in the gopros to my knowledge. The older versions like the Hero 3 are the larger SD cards but now the micro SD cards are allowed. Great price and great quality for those HD pictures and movies. Get it.,
Great little card. Will allow 1080p recording on my note 3 phone. Frustration free packaging is genius. Make sure your device supports the high capacity card before ordering.,
"There is a known issue with a batch of these cards where they can completely die.  This is known defect (affecting a lot of Galaxy S3 and Note users), so if your card dies, either exchange through Amazon or contact SanDisk for a replacement.  Newer cards are supposedly fixed, but you might want to back up your data just in case.  Mine were purchased in November 2012 and both have now failed in separate phones, unreadable by PCs or phones.",
"I researched the purchase of a Kindle for a long time. I couldn't decide whether or not it was worth buying a dedicated e-reader. Boy am I glad I made this purchase. The downside to Amazon's online selling of Kindle 3 is that the customers don't get to see it in person. It is much better in person. This may sound stupid, but when I got my new Kindle, I thought there was a stuck-on overlay on the screen containing a diagram of the unit's buttons, etc. I actually tried to peel it off. Doh! The e-ink on this unit is THAT good. I didn't realize that I was staring at the actual display. I also didn't realize that no power is required until the display changes. (thus the great battery life) I do a lot of reading, but was facing the prospect of reading less or buying large type books because of my variable and deteriorating eyesight. The new Kindle has been a godsend. Now, I can decide the size of type I need depending on my level of fatigue among other things. The weight and ergonomics are very good. For someone, like me, with neuropathy in his hands, it is extremely easy to manage and enjoyable to own. To me, it is easier to read than print books. The ease of navigation is great as is the speed. The battery life, so far, has been extraordinary. It easily connected to our home Wi-Fi, which by design does not broadcast an SSID. It downloads books so fast that I almost thought they were not completely received. I did not buy the 3G version because of the price difference and the fact that there is no coverage where I live. If you are not constantly traveling, I don't see the need to spend the extra bucks, but that is a matter of personal choice. For those who have no Wi-Fi at home, remember that you can always download the material to your computer and transfer it via USB.Read more",
I have always had good luck with sandisk memory cards. This one is no exception. Fast works great in my Galaxy S4 and never a problem with any I have purchased.,
"It came on time, with the adapter. I installed it on my Samsung Galaxy 5. Works great!Scanning 32 GB takes a little more time than the 8 GB I had before - it is expected - nothing to 'complain' about.I would recommend it to anyone interested.",
"These SanDisk Ultra microSDHC Class 10 cards work great in my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 tablet and my Samsung Galaxy S3 phones. I've also used them in non-smart phones, and they work just as well. Fast write/read speeds are HIGHLY recommended to get the best experience from your gadgets and devices, especially when taking pictures/videos, viewing/editing them, opening/editing files, etc. SanDisk has come a long way in terms of quality and performance, and I would not hesitate to buy more of their cards.",
"I am primarily using this to supplement storage on my Microsoft Surface Pro and have a small library of movies and TV shows to carry around while I'm on the go. A lot of ultrabooks and the like come with just 128gb of storage and I think this SD card is a great way to store some media while you save room on the hard-drive for your program installations etc. The speeds I'm seeing are consistently around the peak that the card is rated for, and work great for playback of my lossless MKV movie files recorded at a high blu-ray quality bitrate. I've also tried it with my Android smartphone and I'm seeing similarly high peak-performance speeds for file transfer and smooth playback of media. It comes with an adapter to convert it to the standard SD card size in use with devices like SLR cameras etc. so you'll be covered under almost any circumstance. I only wish I could buy a larger capacity model, but as it stands I think with the Amazon sale prices that regularly come for this product it's a great deal.",
"Item arrived in a timely manner via USPS (surprisingly).  I bought this card to go in my GoPro camera, it fit in there gerat and now I have 3 hours of recording time.",
"My new Kindle Paperwhite came from the USA to a small town in Sweden in just five days. Payment of tax and customs handled by Amazon. Had not the UPS been so square (they think everyone sits at home all day) I had received it a day earlier.I am very pleased with the e-reader, easy on the eyes, and comfortable to hold in one hand. Even if I buy many books from Amazon I also want to read books in the ePub format. A positive surprise was how easy it is to convert ePub format to Amazon's own format. I use the program Calibre and then I just send the book as an attachment in an e-mail to my Kindle. Quick and easy!",
Pretty cool kids love it. Always adding things to my grocery list I didn't want.,
"I just popped it in my Sony Xperia Tablet Z .  It works.  There is no sense that I will ever run out of room.  If I was using it for work that might be different, but I could just change with a new micro sd card.  I don't know why all tablets don't have a port for one.  I feel confident with the SanDisk brand.  I have never bought a bad SanDisk product.",
I had to replace my other 32G MSD Card. Was not aware of the Card Speed issue and as a result started loosing video and pics from the card as they became corrupted. Did a little research and found out the card write speed was the issue. Did not make sense. But replaced the card and yes it works. Have not lost a pic or a vid since.,
I've had Zune music players and with this memory card I could copy all of my CD library and play from my Samsung Galaxy 4.  I forget how many CDs but at least 400 and thousands of songs.  Beats paying network charges and I can move them to my next phone by just moving the card/,
SanDisk 16gb sd card. Does it's job the way it's supposed to. I use it in my tablet and have zero complaints.,
Very easy to setup and use. Still learning to maximize the usage. The instructio is too simple and not cover much using Alexa .,
"This is exactly what I need.Plenty space for just about anything.Works on computers/laptops, PSPs w/adapter, cameras, camcorders, etc.",
"Works in devices that say 32 gig max...Put one in my Casio 14.1 Mega PixelCamera and it says I can take 12,800pictures...",
For the price this Amazon is amazing. Just like the echo but smaller. I show everyone how great it is.,
"this is a great product but with over production comes some small issues at times, my phone will say that my card is damaged sometimes so I have to reboot, not sure if it's the phone or the card, I got 2 of these one for me and the wife, her's never have any issues. I can live with it, it happens every so often ...",
"Using it in my HTC inspire and so far no problems had to format it though, the card is fast and works really well. I'm considering buying one for my tablet.",
"I am very pleased with this memory card, I use it in a dash cam in my car. The quality of videos turn out great and I have no compatibility issues with any equipment I may use for playback.",
Lives up the billing of very fast data transfer speeds.  I love that I can just plug my Note 2 into my PC and drop stuff onto this thing to my hearts content.  Access speeds are very good and I've had no issues using it.,
"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysOctober 11, 2013Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound, and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD. As you correctly point out, the new Kindle Fire HD is the successor to last year's entry level Kindle Fire, which does not include features such as camera, microphone, or HDMI port. You are also correct to point out that this device does not support Mayday, although there are still multiple ways to get help for free directly from your device. We hope you enjoy the new features and services. Thanks, The Kindle Team",
a class 10 micro sd with 32 gd and san disk...its great! no problems so far and is suiting my needs quite nicely!,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"The memory card runs smooth, and is as it says, class 10. The card also comes at a very good price.",
"and fairly cheap. it is a good microSD fast 64GB memory chip... flexible to be used in everything from just flat memory cards, or cameras, vids, etc...",
It exceeded my expectations and recommend this product to friends,
"I needed memory for my first smartphone and this item met the need.  It was reasonably priced, easily installed and according to my friends with smartphones will provide sufficient memory for the forseeable future.  Recommended.",
This card is high quality and a great price. It is not made for video but works well for photography and most other applications. Big enough to hold all your photos and songs. I use it as extra storage for my Galaxy Tab and works great. I would recommend it.,
"this is my 10th SDHC card.  I bought Sandisk only. good quality, good brand. recommend to friends. used in Galaxy Note 10.1",
It works great and transfers quickly. I use it on my Dell Venue Tablet and my Polaroid XS100 action camera.,
"i still own it but card went bad after 2 weeks of owning it, lost tons of music and data ect and lost all faith in sandisk products. i tried to get it replaced or money back but no return email from seller, so unhappy i lost over 20gigs of movies/music and data. wish there would have been a reply from seller or amazon but i still have a dead sdcard with all my files stuck on it.",
"Stuck it in my S2, formatted in settings, works great! Already filled with music, pics and videos...  Get this card, format it right, and you'll have no problems.  If your phone won't do it right, should have got a Samsung! haha...",
"I got this for my ELPH 520-HS camera. Amazing capacity for such small size. I also got the adapter so that I could download all the photos directly, and quickly, into my computer without needing a cable.",
"Extremely wonderful tablet, it definitely gets the job done adaptes very well with everyday usage, good speed, nice display, and one I would definitely recommend to everyone!",
"Great speaker, able to move around, connect to iPad when watching movies. Love it!",
"I have other brands, but prefer Sandisk. I have several and have never had an error or failure. I often shoot video in 2.7k at a high bitrate and this memory card can keep up. That's important to me.I would highly recommend this card.",
"I gave it five stars, simply because I am not a tech genius, so I don't know if it is the best or not - but jeez, this thing is fast and it does everything that I wanted it to do. I have no complaints so far. I'm a very happy customer and I would definitely recommend this product to someone who is looking at buying an affordable micro SD card.",
"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the Fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50 more pixels per inch than the Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:The initial Wi-Fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series. After the final operating software update I mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version of the Fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the HD Fire, as well as last year's 8.9 HD Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7 Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My normal website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7 Kindle Fire HD yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker. The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass. However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am). While the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time - I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers. The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account, both with the software came with the Fire but my primary use of an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store. I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via Google's calendar and contacts. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled inNew Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same. Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be. If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it). For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app/a here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader. Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment. I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for 20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.Mayday button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's regular model of the Fire, is the introduction of the Mayday button. Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent. I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say hi' for purposes of this review.What I Wish it Had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the Fire was ready (why are we waiting). A case is very important in order to protect your investment. Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at 229 for the 16GB of memory model (309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD at 139.

This product is awesome. You can play your favorite music instantly. Also had great fun asking Alexa questions. Some serious some funny. We love it!!,
This works much better than any sd card I had in the past (I have class 4 off brand cards) and it is perfect for the tablet that I bought it for.,
"SanDisk is always reliable, and I have always been satisfied with their products.  I know what I am getting when I purchase products from them.",
"This is a fantastic little drive, has all the gigabytes it says, works in all ways I can discern and I use it to hold the flac recordings I play on my excellent Fiio X5 digital audio player. This is the real thing and not one of the fakes that, evidently, are out there.",
"How do I praise extra memory? It fills my MP3 player with every song my heart desires, the sound quality is perfect. The ease of use is superb. It's great.",
"I was out of space on my Droid RAZR 16GB and still had an empty microSD slot, so I figured I'd pick this up seeing as how it is a reputable brand in flash memory. I am glad I went with the Sandisk Ultra, because there is seemingly no difference in speed between this drive and the built-in internal memory of my phone. I record a lot of videos with my phone and I've been recording straight to this card in HD with no problems at all.Installation was a breeze. I took the memory card out of the package and inserted into my phone. Then my phone brought up a menu asking if I wanted to move my music, videos, and photos to the memory card. I selected all three categories, and in minutes it had moved all of my media onto the memory card. I didn't even have to do anything else. I had read some other reviews that said they had to reformat the card or mess around with moving files by hand, but I didn't have to do any of that.I haven't tried using the included SD adapter yet, but I imagine it will work as well as any other adapter. The adapter and memory card were both shipped in a little clear plastic case, which makes it easier to carry the adapter around with you. So you have it with you when you need it.The price on this card when I bought it was a few dollars more than the generic brands. I decided to spend a few extra dollars on it since I would be really upset if I lost all my photos and videos due to a corrupt memory card. I am very satisfied with the product and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to increase the storage capacity of their phone or anything else this would fit in.",
Great card for note 2 and galaxy 3...you can't do this on iPhone..lolYou need more storage get this...but I don't really like scandisk..don't trust them..I read they have a lot problems with there cards.,
"This is my second Echo purchase. My first was the original Echo for my home and the automation feature aside. The sound is excellent, Alexa's response is better than any digital assistant to date, and the ready access to Prime is convenient. This is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well. Additionally the inclusion of Bluetooth and a headphone jack is amazing.",
Got it exactly what it was displayed and described. bought this directly through amazon at USD 60 only for my samsung captivate glide. all u need to do is to format it with your phone and voila! 59gb (to be exact when calc in bytes)! not a big fan for the transfer speed but it does satisfy my desire of putting one in my phone. buying thru amazon bulk purchase is cheaper but requires u to wait longer for the shipment. but for my case it was faster than expected. a very happy customer. :),
sandisk is  the best and I trust them cause the take care of the quality and the packing was great,
"I bought this memory card for my new Samsung Galaxy Note 3 from T-Mobile, and it works perfectly. Turn off the phone, take off the back cover, insert the card, and reassemble. Simple as that, and when I turned the phone on and checked Storage, there was the external microSD card. The phone shows total space on the card as 59.45GB, but I think that's a function of the phone using some space for its housekeeping and not a shortcoming of the card itself.Like the title indicates, no hassles with this memory card. It just does what it's supposed to do.",
"I bought two of the 32 GB Sandisk Ultra microSDHC cards, and both of them were unusable.The first one stopped accepting new data when I had put a bit less than one gig of data onto the card.  I couldn't add more files, and I couldn't reformat the card. If I tried to write a new file onto the card, the write operation seemed as if it worked, but the new data couldn't be read back successfully.  The files already on the card were still readable, though, so basically, the card had become a 1 GB ROM.  Fortunately, there was no sensitive personal information on the card, so I returned it to Amazon.The second one didn't fail the same way, but it was still unusable.  If I transferred a bunch of files and then read them back, most of the transferred files had data errors.  For example, a 3 minute music file might only be able to have it's first minute of music played back, then the bad data would stop the music player.  I ran a write/readback test and confirmed that there were data errors on nearly every block tested.  (I used Flash_Drive_Tester_v114.exe, which is a free download.)I ended up buying the equivalent Transcend productTranscend Information TS32GUSDC10 32GB micro SDHC10 Flash Memory - No Box or Adapterwhich has been performing flawlessly.  I have over half of the capacity in use, and I've never seen any sign of data loss or corruption.  For USB plug in flash drives, I've had good luck with SanDisk products, but my experience with the SanDisk microSDHC cards has been terrible.",
I wish I could install one of these in my head.  But I will have to settle for installing it in my brain.  The increased memory for my tablet has been great allowing me to use it for many things.,
"it's a must to have it once u got the gopro. practical and very friendly, helps u to load as many recorded shots as possible.",
"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysOctober 11, 2013Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound, and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD. As you correctly point out, the new Kindle Fire HD is the successor to last year's entry level Kindle Fire, which does not include features such as camera, microphone, or HDMI port. You are also correct to point out that this device does not support Mayday, although there are still multiple ways to get help for free directly from your device. We hope you enjoy the new features and services. Thanks, The Kindle Team",
"great price great for cellphones, tablets, etc. easy to put in and easy to use. it comes with a adapter too.",
"So, I was looking for a card to put all of my music on for those occasions when I have my phone but don't have my HD Zune -- which by the way is the BEST music player EVER and it's just a low-down shame they don't make them any more -- and this card holds all my tunes with about 4GB to spare. Excellent speed for music playback, excellent capacity.  Would be nice to get it in 128GB, but the price of those is simply not reasonable.",
Adds a really nice support of memory for any device. I enjoy not worrying about running out of space now.,
"Was expecting a better and faster, more efficient product, and was not disappointed. Replaced a standard type 32 GB card and this does work remarkably better. Pleased with the purchase.",
Is it operate my wife loves it my granddaughter knows how to operate a good sounding Bluetooth speaker great freedom it even tells knock knock jokes in makes my granddaughter crack up that makes it worth every penny I paid useful to recommend to anybody,
"Made a very nice upgrade for my Droid RAZR Maxx, replacing the stock 16GB Class 4 card.  My transfer speeds have improved (though not hugely), and the extra space has made a huge difference.  With a name like SanDisk, I don't worry much about quality or reliability.",
"Stick with the 32GB model. First one got SMOKING hot about 1 minute after use, but it seemed to function. Then I installed it in my Samsung Galaxy Note II and it got hot in the phone. After a day it just quite all together, luckily I still had my 32GB and a backup of my data. Did an RMA and got a new one, which didn't get hot but died after less than a month of use. I'll wait until Lexar's 64GB comes down in price a bit and then try that one...but not this SanDisk one! Their 32GB seem to be ok though.",
Love this product. The card easily integrated with my cellphone. Small and very portable. I would gladly recommend this product to my friends.,
"This SanDisk class 10 microSDHC is installed in my phone and works great. As always, SanDIsk lives up to its name.",
"Alexa {speaking from the Amazon Tap) is great to have around ! Current news, personal planning details as well as details that might have been forgotten are all available from Alexa..... The Tap sits next to my bed on the nite stand where I can easily call up ijnfo from my bed or as I walk by during the day or nite. Especially useful for a review of my calendar so I can review my upcoming days plans. Try Alexa in a store and my guess is you will want her at your house!",
I have used this with a GoPro camera and a faster flash card reduces the amount of rolling shutter.I can't say anything bad about it.,
Haven't had a problem using these with my Hero3 yet. It comes with the little plastic thing to connect to any sd port.,
"I use these as backup for my images when I am out on a photo shoot.  As of to date, they have been very effective in reducing weight and storage space in my pack.",
Good space for the money... put it in my ASUS MemoPad HD7 and I have all kinds of media on it with room to spare! LOVE IT!!,
"SanDisk is the only brand I use - I probably should have gotten a 64 gb as well; but prices keep falling, so I can't really lose.",
"Bought this as an upgrade from having an 16 GB for my android phone, not that I need all the extra space but it's nice to have handy. This will accommodate more pictures and videos that I take with my phone and among other things without having to worry about running out of space, for now. Packaging was good. Arrived on time, having Amazon Prime, that's something you don't have to worry about.",
"Unfortunately this sd card is not fully compatible with the samsung galaxy s2. I installed it and the phone would &#34;check&#34; it only to tell me &#34;SD card ready for removal&#34;. This was a continuous cycle and even after formatting to FAT32, NTFS, and FAT the card would not work and would revert back to exFAT format.I do recommend this product for those who can get it to work but my 3-stars rating is only due to a lack of compatibility listing on the product site.",
Battery life is very long and the sound is surprisingly good. Alexa is not as 'smart' as the marketing would like you to think. I get a lot of 'I don't know the answer to that',
"It's inside of my Galaxy S3, and has worked great. It greatly helps expand the 16 gig internal memory, so I can store music and videos better.",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
Good value for the money.  This is a class ten rated card which has a fast speed and from a good manufacturer.,
Great sound. Portable. The kids love it. Didn't think I would use it but I tend to use it a lot.,
"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more",
Once the tap was able to be activated by voice I started to have some interest. Having said that I notice I do use the 'Tap' button when I have it in my hand. We use it mostly outside and by our hot tub. Took is on vacation this last week and use it at the beach using cell phone as an access point.,
"I bought this a little under a year ago to use with my laptop. Worked just as advertised for much of that time until it stopped letting me write or delete stuff from it (could read just fine). I couldn't even format it. So it kinda just sat there for a while. After trying to format it a number of different ways, I finally contacted sandisk, and they said they will send me a replacement free of charge. I would have maybe given this a lower rating, but the customer service from sandisk made up for the faulty card. I am just glad it fell under a warranty period (I think). Had the card not failed, I would have given five stars. If sandisk wouldn't replace it, would have given one star. Hopefully the latter doesn't happen to you",
"I love this thing, i can store anything on my phone now. I have tons of movies and music now all stored on this SD card. If you don't have one of these and want to be able to store everything youv ever wanted to access via your phone. you NEED to get this.",
Great value and quality speaker that also connects to the information highway.,
"Very fast sd card, I really use it for emulators on the Nvidia Shield and it does the job right. I have no complaints everything is in order and i would recommend.",
I got this to increase the storage in my MS Surface RT.  It has worked like a charm and I've never had any problem with it.,
"Good value for the money, I would recommend having always a few of these around for all photo or film devices",
I plugged this little dude into my Galaxy S4 and have been living with the luxury of being able to store and carry around all my music.  Very good value and I would highly suggest!,
it was already formatted and ready to go.  just plug it in and start recording - nothing more to say for a storage device - just want it to work with no hassles.,
Adds extra storage to my phone flawlessly. The UHS1 means its really fast speed too. Highly recommend to get one of these for any phone/tablet that can take one!,
It's great just wish it did not need a button to work. Otherwise love it!,
Great price for a fast large micro sd card!  recieved it super fast too!  Works perfectly with my Droid 4!  Verizon wanted $50 for a class 4 card like this.,
"April 2013.  I have had the card for about 4 months and seemed to work fine.  I use it to store additional files on my ultrabook as the solid state drive is small (only 128GB).  About a month ago, the card could not be recognized.  It only lasted about 2 hours, so I thought maybe just a momentary blip.  However, this weekened, it cannot be recognized at all and it has been 3 days.  Sandisk support is not available until the week, so I will update on tech support soon.  However, I did find that the SanDisk indicated there was a defect with some of these cards.  I assume they will replace it, but I have lost lots of hours and a lot of pictures... so I am really bummed and frustrated.From SanDisk: ""SanDisk has been made aware of potential product issues involving a very small percentage of its 32GB and 64GB SanDisk Mobile Ultra microSD cards. Under certain circumstances the cards may lock up and the card becomes inaccessible. The issue has been identified and a manufacturing fix has already been put in place. SanDisk stands behind its products and any customer who experiences this issue with the microSD cards cards is asked to contact the SanDisk support center for a resolution immediately."" SanDisk",

"Holds trillions of movie and music files on my Galaxy Note 2, therefore I love it. Good price and works as advertised.What more would one desire?",
It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.,
I purchased this memory card to use in my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it worked right out of the box. I haven't had any issues with it at all and the transfer speeds have been excellent. I would highly recommend this or the 64GB version to anyone looking to increase the storage capacity of your mobile phone.,
Use this card for my slr. Works fantastic and allows me to use burst mode to its full capacity (10fps)... I tried it in my Samsung mp3 player and it works but randomly shows no data and needs a reboot to fix. In all fairness it could be the device or software so I can't deduct a star for that.,
"There are sadly a lot of negative reviews on here, so I though I would add my positive one.I had a second-generation Kindle many years ago, and it has since stopped working. I finally decided to buy a new one.I chose the basic Kindle because that's exactly what I wanted -- a bare-bones e-reader. I have no need for a tablet or anything of the sort. This Kindle delivers on that front in every way possible.At first, I thought I would miss the page turn buttons, and dislike the touch screen. However, I have been delightfully surprised. Tapping the edge of the screen to turn the page is incredibly easy and less intrusive than pushing a button, which was always a nice little jarring reminder that I wasn't, in fact, reading a paperback. The small, quick tap of my thumb on the edge of the screen has become almost like a reflex and I don't notice it anymore it feels natural.I do slightly miss the metal backing of the older Kindles it made them feel a bit sturdier, whereas this basic Kindle is just hard plastic. However, I suspect that using a metal casing would up the price considerably, and I feel that the cheaper price of this basic Kindle far outweighs that slight drawback.I bit the bullet and bought one without the special offers. I do not want ads intruding my Kindle experience, even if they only show as the screensaver or on a bar across the bottom of the Home screen. It is just distasteful to me, and the extra 30 was worth it to me to avoid the ads.I do not need or want a case for my Kindle. I do not like to read with a case on, and it would be cumbersome to remove my Kindle from its case every time I want to read.Read more",
Got this for the family and we all love it. Great gift,
"I bought this to listen to music. I do not use the Alexa feature all that much. The feature does work great, but it gets annoying having to press the button vs how on the echo you just speak. The speakers work great. I can hear the music crystal clear throughout the majority of my house while playing it. Bass is decent. I would recommend to someone.",
"The Amazon Tap is the first step into making your home a smart home. It will act as a brain to everything else. Unfortunately, you'll have to invest quite a bit more for smart lights, thermostat, locks, etc. to get the full potential out of it. Alone, it merely acts as a Bluetooth speaker and extension of your phone.",
"I've used this in an assortment of phones and other devices and it works flawlessly and has good transfer speeds, not once have I ever had a problem with this card or any of the many Sandisk cards I've used, I will keep using this brand as it hasn't failed me yet and great little devices like this one make my life easier.",

"Awesome, just awesome. Great speed also. I use this in a Nikon DSLR, taking 24MP pictures, and this thing rips though them like nothing. I haven't had any heat issues at all or data loss.",
"I've got mixed feelings on this one, unfortunately. This review is coming from a kindle enthusiast who has owned or used nearly every variation of the device since the 1st generation.Size Weight---It's noticeably smaller and lighter than the Paperwhite. When I saw the specs it didn't really strike me as something that would make much difference to me, but in real life it's actually great. The Voyage fits into a few of my coat pockets that the Paperwhite was just a little too big to fit into.Origami Cover---I know there's a separate product page for the origami cover, but it's worth mentioning here as it is the official cover. The origami cover is ugly and I was skeptical, but I actually love it. It's weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a notepad. This actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open, in my opinion. It's hard to describe, but there are a lot more ways to hold the Voyage when it's attached to this cover, and just generally is more comfortable to use. The origami part of the case works great as well... it stands vertically or horizontally (if you're laying down and reading, this is amazing).The other great new thing about this case is that the Voyage attaches to it magnetically. It attaches and detaches very easily, unlike the Paperwhite which seemed to be nearly permanently attached to the standard case. This is great because if you decide you want to read the device and appreciate how light/thin it is without a case attached, it's super easy to take it out.It's pricey but worth it.PagePress---One of the new features is PagePress, which has sensors on the outer edge of the device that you can squeeze to turn pages.Read more",
I enjoy it. It's gray for reading and working out.,
The only thing we don't like is that it had to stay plugged in to work.,
I love this product. Great sound quality and at a good price,

"This is being used in a Mobius Action Camera 1080P HD Mini Sports Cam/dash cam daily so the opportunity for failure or problems would be readily apparent.  It has really delivered as promised.  Speed and reliability are great.  The adapter works perfectly as well.  I have several other SanDisk products including SD cards, thumb drives and an SSD and all have been terrific.So far I can highly recommend the SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card. I will post again if any issues arise.",
It installed and is working without any problems in my Samsung Note 2.  Price was  very good for the price.,
"I ordered this card for my Samsung Note 3.  I had to properly format it for my phone which was easy.  I transferred all of my pictures and music from my old card and it works like a charm.

The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall...

"Amazon Echo is great. But it is stuck at home. Amazon Tap on the other hand goes everywhere. In the short time we have had ours, we have brought it to Sweden, Portugal, the lake up north and friend's houses.

You can also easily pair several devices to the Tap via Bluetooth. What really makes this device great is that the cloud based software is continually updated.

"UPDATE 7/24/16: After using my Oasis for almost 3 months, I thought I would add a brief comment to my original review. I have settled on using the Oasis for reading in bed, where it's lighter and easier to hold and I prefer the page turn button style. For my reading elsewhere, for example if I want to read while eating, I use my Voyage w/origami case to hold it upright. I can read the same book using both Kindles since they stay synch'd to one another, and it's given me basically the best of both worlds, at least for my style of reading. The Voyage with cover almost seems clunky - bulkier and heavier - compared to the Oasis, but when it's sitting on a table it hardly matters. I have to say that I'm fortunate in being able to afford both, and the new base model Kindle that I recently picked up is not yet getting much use, even though much of my reading is in lighting conditions where the non-illuminated display works just fine. My original review follows.---------Amazon released the first Kindle in November of 2007. Eight and a half years later, the Oasis model is the 8th generation Kindle and the third evolution of Kindle with built-in illumination. The price of 300+ was a bit of a shock, but I ordered mine as soon as it was announced on April 13th. I then spent the next two weeks reading what was available online describing the features and benefits and asking myself whether or not I had made the right decision. Now that its finally been released and I have it in my hands, how different is it, and is it worth what appears at first to be a very high price(My Kindle experience: I purchased my first Kindle (a first generation Paperwhite), when it was first released in Sept 2012. I purchased the Voyage when it was first released, in Sept 2014.Read more",
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
"got this super cheap works great in my phone, now if I could figure out how to put music on the phone :)",
"I bought this for my Samsung Note tablet 10/1 to store movies and books. I haven't watched a full movie on it, though I have watched a full TV show without issues.  I don't really do anything else that needs speed, so I can't say how fast it is.",
"This is a 32gb memory card. Works right out of the case, Does exactly what the description says. Very fast Read/Write speeds. I recommend this to anyone (I am currently using this on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0",
"My only gripe is I wish it were a bit cheaper, but you never need something like this when it's on sale.",
"Not much to say about this, but it was definitely worth the buy. It comes w/ a small case to hold both itself and the adapter. For just over $10 you really can't go wrong.",
purchased to use in a dash cam system. works perfectly. no skips or corruption of files on the recorder. highly reccomended.,
In constant use on my Samsung Ativ 700t since January with narry a problem. I just bought my third one :),
I just recently received a new Nook HD+ Tablet as a gift  and wanted to increase the storage capacity as well as convert it to an android base system with the N2A software! This card was compatible and has really increased the flexibility of my new Nook without having to root the system and void my warranty. I can use my new Nook either way. Plus the card was at a reasonable price and really the latest in technology!,
Samsung gives you the ability to install apps on your SD card with Galaxy devices. I had a class 4 SD card before and initially blamed the tablet. I thought I was going to have to get it replaced. It was the SD card.I got this SD card and have yet to experience any issues! Love this thing!,
THIS CARD DIED IN LESS THAN ONE MONTH IN MY SIII LOST 400 PICTURES VALUABLE PICTURES AND INFORMATION DO NOT BUY.,
"Whether I'm on vacation or just taking photos and videos around the house I don't trust any other memory cards to keep all my memories.  I bought this card mainly for my Contour ROAM 2 Helmet Cam, but I've been using SanDisk Compact Flash Cards in my Canon DSLR and SanDisk SD Cards in my Panasonic HMC40 video camera and I've never had a single problem.  They don't fail, I've never had a file corrupted, they've survived x rays at the airport and extreme weather conditions.  Sometimes I'm tempted with the prices of other memory cards but in the end I go with the SanDisk for that warm and fuzzy feeling of knowing all my photos and videos will be perfectly safe.",
"I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed. It sometimes takes a while after you push next page' for it to actually change.Read more",
"This memory is very fast, perfect for phones, very good product I give it 5 stars and recommend it for all types of use ...",
"Very good product that I am using with my smart phone. As usual, Amazon packageing was acceptable and it didn't take forever to open as some packages seem to take.",
"Its a memory card that simply worked when I plugged it in. Not the fastest, but not the most expensive.",
"Transfers at about 10MB/s, not super speedy but it allows me to run software from it on my windows tablet.",
"I bought it for my new galaxy note and I realized the device didn't recognize it...tried it on other devices, laptops, desktop, macbook didn't work...Very disappointed !",
"If you like the Kindle Fire HD then you will love the Kindle Fire HDX. The new device runs three times faster, is lighter in weight, and the battery lasts slightly longer.

Great brand and excellent price. I purchased this for my Lenovo IdeaTab A2109 tablet. The adapter comes in handy when I need to use for a standard SD slot.,
I've seen some reviews of Micro SD media that complains about it working for only a certain number of re-writes before it fails. I've been using these SD cards in dash cameras for the last 6 months and they are still working great!,
"I have not pushed this card by writing and reading tons of video or anything, but it seems to work fine.",
"Had older model, that you could text to speech, this one hasn't. Liked the smaller size, but having to buy a different cover! Still getting used to shelf quite different from my 4 year old model.Paper white is nice reading.",
"Couldn't ask for more!  The biggest Micro SD Card for the most awesome phone the Galaxy S3!  Put tons of my music library on the card, full length movies, and have crazy space available.  I love having space to spare and not have to worry about every running out.Highly recommended!  Don't buy this from AT&T; they are asking 130 dollars for the exact same card!",
This card is fast enough to meet my needs on a galaxy note 3. Plenty of memory for my pictures and files. No problems,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
Quick and easy -- just insert into SD slot and gives you about 32 GB of external storage.  I like it.,
"Works great in my modern phone and tablet. However I was unable to use it on my PC's SD card reader. It appears the older card readers are not compatible with Class 10 as both my new cards could not be written to without the operating system (Win7) reporting write errors.I probably should blame the card reader, but it never failed me until trying to write to this card.",
Good deal at a great price.  It is sturdy and has over 31 GB after its format. I'll be getting another.,
This Micro SD card works great. I even formatted it to FAT32 to use in my car for my TV headunit and have had no issues. Plus when i bought it it was down to 34.99 from 50.00. Great deal. I recommend setting an alert on www . camel camel camel . com so you get the best price.,
"I collect these streaming boxes, anything from Google Chromecast to Dlink Boxee Box, Boxee TV etc. This Amazon Fire TV has been my go to device since it arrived.The menu could use some work, but it's most likely because I'm used to Apple TV and my iOS environment.The responsiveness is top notch. My favorite feature is the voice control, built right into the remote.I would only ask for one additional feature, the ability to plug headphones into the remote and listen silently.",
for me i prefer sandisk over other manufacturers. i have  come to trust in the quality and workmanship of their products.,
Bought this to use in a video camera. It's super fast and holds a ton of data. Buy this one!,
"This is a great on-the-go speaker. I like the fact that it sits on a charging cradle instead of having to plug in. Also, bonus: Alex. I like the update they have done to it as well where you don't have to push the button to activate her, you can just say her name. If you are looking for an echo with a decent speaker without paying too much, choose this one. Spend more,m and you can get the regular echo which has a better booming sound, but you can't travel with it.",
this gave me enough storage to record 2 long scuba dives at full 1080p @ 60FPS without having to transfer to the computer.  Thats close to 2 hours.  It comes with an adapter to use with other sd devices too.  Very Happy with it.,
Good price. I searched everywhere locally and couldn't find a better price. They work just fine in my Galaxy S4 and Tab 8.,
"Bought it for my S4; it Works like a charm.  No setup needed, my S4 reads it automatically.  Great price. :)",
Great price and great quality. It fit perfectly in my device. I highly recommend this brand. The adapter was a nice bonus.,
"Absolutely great addition to my Note2. Provides plenty of fast storage. If you consider it, just buy it. Enough said - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!",
"It works great, good size good  and good price. Only giving it 4 stars because it is a &#34;little&#34; slow to write and read from but it is to be expected from an XC card with speeds up to 10mb/s I believe.",
"We bought 2 of these for our GSIII's. No issues, fast read and writes and the price is right. Not a big surprise - another quality product from SanDisk.",
"it's a nice color, it fits the fire8 very well, however, i cannot stand it on it's side, unless I reverse the fire8, and put the right side on the bottom. The stand does not work on it's left side the way the diagram shows.",
"This arrived quickly and was the actual product that was described, unlike what others committed about this item.  It works and does just what I needed it for.  Thanks.",
"More than you average portable bluetooth speaker. Can stream from amazon, spotify, pandora, etc. As the namesake says, give it a tap to ask Alexa any questions, add to your list, order something on Amazon, etc.Battery life is good, and speaker is decent, but can't compete your UE or JBL.",
It's a memory card. What else is there to say. This is a Class 10 so it reads and writes files very quickly.,
"UPDATE: July 6, 2015I'm reducing my rating to one star because all of a sudden this morning the screen protector just quit adhering to the screen. It falls off completely and if you do get it in place within five minutes it's slipping again and huge bubbles form. I have never had a problem with a Moshi product before and I am very surprised by this. At this price there is no excuse for the poor longevity of this product and I would never ever buy one again nor would I advise anybody to spend the money on this product to begin with.Original review follows in all its irony except for the whining about the price at the time that I still stand by:Superb screen protector. The best you can buy. Ridiculous price. Moshi products have been the stress reliever I've relied on when it comes to tablets and phone screen saver installation with their bubble proof installation and performance, but in this particular case I think the price I paid was twice what it was worth. So now the stress is back.",
"Even the website ([...] had this card in the picture of what i'd be ordering. When i got a plain black sandisk card i was a bit concernes, and peeved sonsidering i bought the big one. Turns out android HATE class 10 cards and much more prefers Class 4 cards because of the way the OS accesses LOTS of files at once, and Class 4 timing is just better for their computations. Only the 1 star off because of my own expectations.Otherwise this is gonna make a great camera card, hopefully the pics take faster (it's certainly a size upgrade atleast!).",
"overall good quality item, worked fine from the start with no problems. Stores photos quick without a lot of hassle.",
"Fast, reliable, plenty of size for the money. I ran Sandisk memory zone on this and was reading between 22 and 29 mbps. Not quite the 30 that it is supposedly rated at, but that is with a lot of apps installed and running off of the device.",
"In conjunction with the Meenova adapter and nexus media importer I make use of this for extra storage of media files (music, audiobooks and movies) for my two Nexus models. I removed it from the package, copied a video file from my laptop and played it on my Nexus without any problems or delay.",
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
It was exactly the memory card I ordered. I tested it using the adapter that came with it by plugging it into my computer. Worked great.I replaced the 8 GB card already in my new tablet (a month old) with the new 32GB card and everything ground to a halt. Waiting a long time made no difference.The maximum card size for my tablet is 32GB. I guess for now it's just an ornament. That's why it was the unexpected. That's why it only got 4 stars.Update: the memory card may not be at fault.,
I have it more then half of year now and still can not believe how they manage to fit 64GB on that small piece of plastic.. :),
"It's amazing to think that I need the space, but I do, and 32 GB is nice. Love not having to worry about needing more space on my phone...yet.",
"When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It's actually it's own device. Yes, it's portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same ""alexa"" set up. The Echo operates with no hands…you can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit.",
"The Sandisk Ultra 64GB Micro Card is a great addition to maximize the Samsung Galaxy IIIS, whatever version you got 16GB or 32GB. Is a very fast memory at a great price. Plenty space for pictures, videos and Android Applications. Good for the 1080 videos that the Galaxy IIIS use. Super Fast. If you got the most advanced smartphone in the market as I do, this is the memory to get at the right price.",
Makes for a great alarm and reminder device. I own 2 dots and the tap. Use them all.,
"This was a great deal that I would purchase again if I need another just like it. My Galaxy Note 3 is great for videos, games and movies so it needs a lot of storage. This SanDisk had just the right amount of GBs and price to make this a great deal. It's almost filled up already so I might buy another one soon. Don't hesitate if you're interested in quality storage.",
"I put this NEW sd card in my NEW GS4 for the first time, and now the metal contacts are scratched and it randomly unmounts from the phone!  My older 32GB SanDisk works just fine, so I'm thinking its the thicker paint or something causing this...  I don't know, but its ruined!  It scratched the first day, but I'm just now noticing the unmounts now that I have my music on it, every few songs it will unmount and remount, interupting my music...  I'll never buy another expensive SanDisk.  I'm going to order a different brand, just make sure I can find one without paint on it....  Sucks, I really thought this was going to be a good one!  I love the colors, and its so fast to transfer files to.... too bad its broken.  And I didn't find out about it until after the return date, so i'm screwed.  Oh well.  Never again, I'll give my business to someone else....",
Bought this for my new Galaxy S4 and it works great. Class 10 is the way to go especially when slower cards are not much cheaper.,
I put this into an old Samsung table that my kids use and it seems to work well. We have some videos on this card as well as a large number of apps. I have not had any problems.,
"In addition to the Fire TV, I have an Apple TV as well as a ChromeCast. By far and large, the best product is the Fire TV. I use it more than both the other ones combined. Having integration between my Prime list and the device is clutch, as I consume media across several different devices.I do wish I could search by Prime Instant, so I hope they will fix that. I also wish I could cast a Prime Instant streaming video from a device to the Fire TV, but I don't see that as an option (although I can cast YouTube to my Fire TV, which is really cool).There is no doubt that it is faster than both Apple TV and ChromeCast, and the voice recognition is SO convenient. I also have the game controller, and the games are pretty good. I don't game much, but I wanted to check it out. I was surprised at the speed of the games and the level of engagement.I'd also like to be able to see a future improvement where screens can be mirrored from devices to this (both ChromeCast and Apple TV have this). From an educator's standpoint, this could be the 100 solution to wireless projection for classroom teachers (Apple TV doesn't play well with enterprise level security, and ChromeCast doesn't do well with some software that is essential for instruction).All in all, it's my favorite media device. It's faster, has a great and snappy UI, and is easy to setup.",
"I haven't used it extensively at this point, but it holds my data well...as it should. SanDisk continues to be a solid brand.",
"With so much memory used on my Galaxy s4. This allows for massive overkill on external storage.Its fast, and convenient.",
Love it!!  Been using this card for six-months now and it hasn't failed me yet!  So far I wiped it once from use in a mp3 player to a 3ds memory card and it has performed flawlessly.  The price is actually lower now than when I first purchased so go ahead and purchase one with no regrets!,
"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.",
Perfect counterpart for the Microsoft Surface RT tablet. Supports Bitlocker encryption so you can keep it password encrypted in case you lose it. I have no issues playing HD videos from it using the Windows 8 default video player.,
"I was impressed with the sound of the original Echo, the price of the Dot. The Echo Tap is the best of both and Portable. I have echos in multiple rooms. I got this to bring music outside to the patio. The music has rich bass and clear sound perfect for tunes or talk. Now that SiriusXM is on Alexa too I have access to great music, Howard stern, NFL, MLB and all the rest of the satellite radio content. The great thing about the tap is unlike a normal Bluetooth speaker this one works solo with Alexa and wifi. Even my wife loves it I think she talks to Alexa now more than she talks to me.",
We love it. Bought one for family room and the office. Easy to install and use. LOVE all of the options for things to watch.,
"I bought this Memory card because of the Sandisk Reputation and the Class 10 speed, I use this for my Samsung Galaxy Tablet, the Class 10 speed is really impressive! The Memory card can write to memory pictures as fast as you can take them, loading music is almost Instantaneous and a 5 minute Music video loads in about 4 seconds! I highly recommend this for any Tablet or Smartphone with expandable memory Class 10 speed with Sandisk reliability, worth every penny!",
"I couldn't put any files onto the card that were &#62;5 Gb. A little disappointing since I wanted to store movies on it, but I guess it's a limitation of the MicroSD HC technology.",
"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go. Until now, nobody quite got it right. In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software. I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon. We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon. The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone. Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands. To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without. Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try. Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!Update: After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.1. Use the best speakers you can with it. I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.2. Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.Read more",
"Cameras are getting smaller and smaller at the same time their resolution is getting better and better.  In order to take full advantage of your pixels, your files get larger and larger ultimately rendering small sized picture cards less handy.  Most cameras now let you take a mini-movie which also eats up space quite quickly.This SanDisk card gives you the ability to store considerably more information in a neat small footprint.  If you do want to go with this card make sure it is compatible with your equipment.  Not every camera takes every card so you have to do some due diligence.",
Good price at the time of purchase. Used this on my pda/cellphone device. Has been working without any problems ever since purchased (about 8 months now).,
reliably turns my blackberry into a jukebox full of music & video files no buffering or stuttering to catch up,

I have recently purchased a Samsug Galaxy tablet. The SanDisk 32 Gb. Memory Card was an excellent addition to the already powerful tablet PC.,
"Not much to say about the product , there is no configuration needed.it works out of the box, no need to format it unless if you want to.Speed? The tablet processor speed and the card make it impossible for you to see any delay. I am recommand it for anybody that have burchase those 16 GB tablet or phone. Specially if you have pictures and musics that you need to keep. The market carries 64 GB and up so make your best judgment and save.",

"Amazon has just updated their bargain priced Fire tablets. While these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation, I believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market. Its still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks, and its such a good all-around performer (for the most part)!I purchased both the 7 and 8 Fire models because I wanted to see how they compared, and I was curious how they performed. They are both shown in the video attached to this review. I will focus here on the 7 model, to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive 8 Fire tablet is worth the extra money (and if the 7 model is worth purchasing on its own merits).I've given this 7 model a 4-star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output (see detailed comments below). It is still a terrific bargain at the price, but I do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses.SUMMARY- These new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation Fire tablets:--- Same display specs as before (Amazon says the 7 model has an improved display), same processors (1.3 GHz quad-core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation), same standard and available storage (7 8 or 16 GB 8 16 or 32 GB)--- New colors--- the 8 model is 10 cheaper--- the 7 model now has dual band wi-fi (previously single band wi-fi) for better connectivity--- Kids edition now available for both models (previously only the 7 model).Read more",
"After a small preasure while trying to remove it from a device it got brokenAlso, the I/O speed is not amazing, even for a Class 10",
good memory card. no issues. works as it should. price is great when you are able to find it on a lightning deal!,
Love that it's 'interactive' as long as I'm connected to the wifi or via Bluetooth to my phone! The sound is pretty good - tends to get a little 'tinny' sounding if you turn it up too loud. But overall a good sound. I'm still trying to find Alexa's limits on what she can and can't do!!,
"This turned my Samsung Galaxy S3 into a Tardis.  It's bigger on the inside!I haven't done anything speccy to figure out the read/write speeds, etc., but I know that HD content both records and plays without a hiccup, and really that's all that matters to me.",
"These work great in my mobile devices,  they always work they are large enough to store lots of songs and movies for those long flights.",
Compatibility should not be an issue with these memory cards.  Even though they are SDHC they are very backwards compatible.  I threw a 32 gb in my phone for extra storage and I  have had no issues with it.  Make sure you move apps from your phone to your SD Card storage though.  It's future proof and you can hide important files on it if you want.,
I loaded this memory card into my TF700T and could not get it to install. I found it to be a format issue and could not reformat it to get it to work. I sent it back and got the class 10 sandisc card ( non ultra ) and it loaded perfactly.,
"I upgraded a generic, small micro sd card I had on hand and was using in my GS4.  This card is very fast making for seamless read and write of pictures, video and playback of music stored on the SD card.  It works great which is exactly what I have come to expect from all SanDisk products.",
"I bought the first Kindle when it came out and, while I liked it, I didn't use it that much because the page turn buttons could be too easily triggered, and the cover was somewhat clumsy to use. The second generation Kindle was a lot better, but I still preferred to read physical books with the Kindle being a solution for being able to have books available without taking up any more space (I still buy physical books, but most are donated to the local library, Salvation Army, etc. after I've read them).Next, about a year after it came out, I bought what Amazon called the Kindle Keyboard and was hooked! I began using the Kindle as a preferred reading medium over physical books and thought that the Kindle Keyboard couldn't be improved upon (I've since given a couple as gifts). I liked the storage capacity, the 3G capability and thought I wouldn't want to be without the keyboard. After reading more than seventy books on it I couldn't imagine trying a Kindle with less memory and only Wi-fi.I was wrong.I ordered this 4th Generation Kindle earlier this year, thinking I'd have it for a backup to my Kindle Keyboard. Instead, it has become my much-preferred device. Storage room With the cloud, it's really not an issue. I keep a few reference books on both of my current Kindles (the Keyboard and this one) as well as what I'm currently reading. I haven't had any problem with coming close to exceeding the storage capacity. While it would be nice to have 3G, it's not a deal-killer at all. I've already read close to 50 books on this Kindle and I've only found myself without easy access to Wi-fi once. When I'm close to finishing a book, I plan ahead and download a new one (or two) so that I'm ready wherever I happen to be.Read more",
"Arrived earlier than expected. Been using it about a month now. Easy installation into my LG Optimus G Pro. $50 for 50-something more gigs, deal.",
We live in an RV and we get internet through our phones Hotspot or from free WiFi in RV Parks. Fire TV is sometimes the only way to pick up the TV Shows we have missed. I have not been able to find CBN or The Blaze TV on the device. Those and two of my favorites that I used to watch on the Roku device that I miss.,
I bought this to create a larger store for my RPi Model B and it works flawlessly so far. Fast and plenty of space. A good deal for the price I paid.,
I got this for my Samsung Galaxy S5 and could not be happier. It's fast enough with the still and video camera on the phone.I have had no problems transferring files of all types from my pc or tablets. At this price it is a great buy.,
"High quality, high performance. Used to expand the memory on a DROID M. Inserted the card and we were good to go. Great for expanding smart phone storage and digital cameras.",
Bought this for my phone so I don't have to constantly transfer pics to my computer. Works great so far!,
"Let me guess: you love books, but you're not sure you want to get a kindle because you love the feel of books, rightI'm here to tell you that the kindle is the perfect balance of book and digital format.SHORT REVIEWYes, you should buy a kindle. Get the paperwhite with no ads. You're welcome.LONG REVIEWI love physical books too, I'm with you. But I know myself, and I know that once I forget to take the book I'm reading with me, that's it. I'll start another book and rarely finish the first. I also know if I try and read on my phone or iPad that I'll get distracted and start wondering about what's happening on the internet (Instagram's not gonna scroll ITSELF). Either way I'm not finishing the book.WHY KINDLEThe kindle takes the best of both worlds and mashes them together. The e ink display is honestly incredible. I wish iPhones had an e ink display. It really looks just like a printed page. So you get the experience of reading a physical paper book, but with the perks of being digital.Namely:- Share what book you're reading to Goodreads, Facebook, or twitter (so you can look SMORT)- Built in dictionary (so you can learn the proper spelling of the word SMORT)- Export your highlights as a PDFPlus, it'll also sync with the kindle app on your phone so you can squeeze in the final few pages of the chapter while you're in the bathroom (don't pretend you don't do that. You're either on your phone or you're reading the febreeze ingredients)READING IN BEDThe backlight looks great. It's a perfect size.Read more",
My adaptor doesn't work. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but there are no instructions. It looks pretty simple. So it just simply doesn't work.,
"I use this for my R4 SDHC Dual Core for my 3DS XL. It holds about 30 movies currently, and it also holds a number of different emulators plus games, plus It holds about 150 NDS games on it as well, and I STILL HAVE 5gb of storage left for extra stuff. Simply incredible how they are able to offer that much storage in such a little package. Thank you sandisk for being the foremost leader in Memory technology. My hat goes off to you. And they do it all at an affordable price.",
"I get randomly error messages with my nokia808, ""disk error-"" and the card stops working, its so, so sad.. I bought a cheap 8gb micro sd class 4 that works better than this :(",

"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter.She loves it, easy to use, speakers are more clear than her other devices Great volume",
"my phone is still on gingerbread os, so this card is much faster than i will ever need with its capabilities. i like that it has a lifetime warranty, as my previous 32gb card did not have a warranty and is now fried after one year. for $28 with shipping this should hold me over for many years to come and has the speeds to keep up with future devices. overall very pleased. got 9mb/s write speed and 22mb/s read speed on a motorola defy xt using a speed test app",
I installed this on my Samsung tablet tab 2 7.0. There is definitely a performance difference on my tablet especially when i load up all my apps.,
"I'll never need another/bigger Memory Card.  It's fast, plugs right in. It didn't need any setup etc..  SanDisk is a quality brand.",
"First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory. It would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage, go buy a computer.Display: One word, amazing. Maybe I am pushing it, but the screen is so clear. I own an iPhone 5 and my eyes prefer my kindle. I love reading on this machine and for the price, amazon did a good job with this one.Read more",
I am extremely pleased with this case. Though lightweight it is well constructed and crafted in a way so that it protects the Kindle from bumps and bruises and it also will protect the screen if the Kindle happens to fall on its face. This is a great buy and I highly recommend if you want to keep your Kindle safe from harm,
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
Nice to have such a large card for very similar pricing as two smaller memory cards. Lets me have plenty of room for movies and tv shows on my tablet.,
"incredible speed, phone recognized it within moments. I was able to transfer all my books music videos and everything onto my phone and have room to spare without having to worry about a fully consumed memory card. arrived a day earlier than I even assumed.pros:incredible speed.Class 10exactly as orderedtons of storage!cons:I'll be serious, nothing wrong at all here.",
"Bought it for my Android cell phone (Moto Droid X2) and it works great. Very fast, plays MP3s with no skipping, transferred apps that could be moved to the SD card with no problems to create more internal memory space. Wasn't sure it was necessary to get a class 10 card, but this SanDisk ultra 32 GB allowed me purchase a good quality card at a very reasonable cost.",
Great price on the 64GB mircoSD card... my boyfriend has had it in his Galaxy note 2 for the past few months.. and I just got a note 2 and just bought another one for my phone!  :),
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",

"I have tested this card in both a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 phone and aSamsung Galaxy Tab 3 (10.1-Inchand it was immediately recognized by both devices. As I write this review the card has been running in my Tab 3 and constantly used for over a week.Other reviews have dissected the specs of this card, so I'll share how I use it and why I prefer these over the 64GB cards (which I also own and use). The price point on these 32GB cards have dramatically fallen and as of the date of this review they are priced as commodities. I use a few pairs of these to rotate backups on my laptop, so I always have a daily snapshot of my documents. For that purpose alone these cards are well worth it.For my tablet I have divided my extensive music library into genres and have them backed up to these cards. A 32GB card will hold about 150 CDs, so the space savings along over the physical media is significant. In fact one of these cards cost about the same as a rack for 150 CDs.These are also excellent for saving practice sessions that I sometimes record using my phone or tablet. I pop my primary SD card out of the device and swap one of these in to video record. Since this card will hold about six hours of video it's perfect for that use.Overall, these are reliable cards that have worked in a number of devices I own. I can assure anyone wanting to use them in a newer Samsung Note 2 or 3 phone or Tab 3 tablet that this card will work, and it is also excellent for HD video recording. At the price point it's an absolute bargain.",
"Ok first things first, I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap.Now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the Tap was voice enabled like the Echo. I happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through. Because the Echo is not meant to be a mobile device. It generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have. But the Tap is meant to be mobile, and therefore I am happy it's not a Voice command device. I would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it. So I actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature. I have the Echo on my kitchen counter and the Tap in my Studio office. And when I leave my office I just grab it and go.I bought this on sale for 89 and I went to the store and listened to many Bluetooth speakers. And while yes the charge 3 sounds better, all the charge 3 can do is be a Bluetooth speaker. While the Tap is so much more for less . And the Tap sounds Great. After looking online I was a little nervous that it would not sound that great, but I was 100 wrong about that. There is no other product out there for 89 that sounds this good and can do what the Tap does.I was not paid or given a Tap to write this review. I'm just a consumer who was it the market for a Bluetooth speaker, and I could not be happier with my choice.Also if you buy this device buy the Amazon sling as well. Trust me you will want it. And honestly I am again happy I got the one that covers the bottom of the Tap. Because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink I would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed.That's it, that's all. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!",
"I have a lot of memory cards for a variety of digiral devices. This is the smallest memory device I have ever owned and 32 GB of storage, that's outrageous...",

"I didn't see this brand listed on the GoPro website as one of the recommended cards but I've never had an issue with SanDisk before so I gave it a try. It is a UHS1 card so it doesn't ever stop recording due to write errors. For the price, you can't beat the quality that comes with it. It also included a microSD to Standard SD card adapter so that you don't need a different card reader if you have one for your old SD cards.",
Does it's job and fairly cheap for what it's worth. I had to return my first one and exchange it for another because the first one was defective. Sandisk really needs to do better quality assurance on their products. The second one works perfectly fine. I use it for my GoPro camera.,

"Allow me to preface this with a little history. I am (was) a casual reader who owned a Nook Simple Touch from 2011. I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you.",
"Works great and it is so nice to have enough space for all my movies and books, comics and such that I like to keep on my tablet.",
This is the best of both worlds. A reasonably priced BT speaker and an Amazon Alexa enabled device. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a BT speaker and considering an Alexa enabled device.,

"I previously owned an Asus infinity with 10 inch screen until it died on vacation and I grabbed the smaller 8 gb fire during the one day sale. I could not get used to the small screen or lack of storage so here I am with the new 10 inch fire. If you liked your fire 7 you will love this. The 32 gb is sufficient itself for downloading tons of books, music, and a couple of movies and games but when you pair that with the ability at last to use a memory card (and it's about time Amazon makes a version that can do this) the storage is enough for even most power users! Set up is a breeze just follow the onscreen instructions. Within minutes out of the box I was surfing the web, checking my email and posting on Facebook. After charging the battery to full I streamed a one hour tv show from Netflix and when I checked afterwards the battery was still at 95 percent. I am writing this review on it right now. If you have prime you can download a movie to watch later without needing your wifi which is a big plus for me as we are in storm season here so when the power goes out I can at least watch a movie.",
"This is the fifth e-ink Kindle reader that I've bought. My wife and I were early adopters of Kindle, and when we buy a new Kindle, the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line. I loved the original Paperwhite, with its small size, touch screen, front-lighting, and virtual keyboard. The all-new Paperwhite is a definite step up, and for me, it was worth the move, but others will have to decide for themselves. If you read a lot, and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink Kindles, it's definitely worth upgrading to the Paperwhite. If you have the original Paperwhite, the upgrade is well worth considering. Although I've only had the new Paperwhite a few hours, I'm already glad I upgraded. Here's a summary of my initial impressions of the new Paperwhite.SIZE: It's the same size as the original Paperwhite - 6.7x4.6x0.36. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.8 ounces to 7.3 ounces. The Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand, which is how I usually read. The really good news is that if you have a case for the original Paperwhite, it will also fit the new one (thank you, Amazon). If you buy a case, I highly recommend that the case include the magnetic AutoWake function. It's much easier to turn the Kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch.LIGHTING: The front-lighting is noticeably improved over the original Paperwhite, which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the LED lights were located. (It didn't bother me, but some readers were annoyed by that.) I couldn't see any shadows in the new Paperwhite, where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform. With the Paperwhite's front lighting, you'll never need a clip-on light, even in total darkness.Read more",
"Large capacity, fast and functional.  San disk continues to provide the quality the public has come to expect.  I have never owned or had any problems with their storage line.",
"I dunno if it's a bad copy or what but When I try to transfer files like 2GB or 3GB it doesn't copy! It ejects itself and then mounts itself again. I had to transfer all my songs from my PC through Airdroid which was a pain in the a$$ I can't transfer movies from my PC and by the way I tried formatting it and checking for some errors but same issue but I can move smaller files like 20MB or soVery disappointing especially for such price!UPDATE: Now I have more problems! My phone tells me every now and then that the ""SD card was unexpectedly removed"" and I tried on other phones with the same problem",
"It was for my new Galaxy note 2, I am not sure if I ever need one 64GB, but why not, when these is a bargain for one.",
"For some unknown reason I could not find this locally.  I needed it for a security camera, which I suppose is an odd application for most people, but I found it on Amazon and received it quickly.  SanDisk products have worked very well for me and I now have a record of who comes and goes from my driveway on this micro disc at my disposal when I need that information.",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.br /br /First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.br /br /Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.br /br /Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
"Major fan, didn't buy this because of protection, bought it cause it will blend in to my decor. It is not a skin, so it's not skin tight. Yes it's loose but how often will you grab it and move it. Me maybe once every year.",
Sandisk is the best & moist reliable memory card out there. Perfect fit for my new Galaxy Note 3 smartphone !,
This is a memory card that will be used for my wife's tablet. This will upgrade her memory to the maximum. She will have no storage space problems.,
This micro SD with adapter works fine.  I have no complaints.  If there was one thing I would wish for is a little less packaging --- it was over packaged for something sent mail order.,
I bought a new Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone and needed an expansion card to boost up the memory for photos and music.  This is the cheapest 32Gb card I could find.  Works well.,
"The memory card works well and I have no problem with it. It was one of the cheapest out there. Came with adapter, so that's convenient.",
"I don't know why there are so many bad reviews. First of, let's start off by pointing out the obvious, it's under 100. You're not going to receive a Kindle Paperwhite. Before you order, read the specs and compare it to the other Kindles. Yes, the specs say it doesn't have backlighting so honestly, there shouldn't be one ounce of surprise when you receive this. I on the other hand, love this little Kindle. I have had the new Kindle Paperwhite and I really didn't like how big it was to hold in my small hands. I don't have children hands, but I'm a female and my hands are on the small side. Maybe for a male this would be kind of small, Idk. Anyway, it is smaller than the Paperwhite, but I love that. I also love the fact that it doesn't come with a light. I used to read at night with the Paperwhite, but that light gave me a headache so I stopped. It is NOT as dark as these bad reviews make it seem. You can read perfectly fine being indoors. They're exaggerating. This feels more like a book to me than the Kindle Paperwhite ever did. The letters on this Kindle are amazing. I don't even notice the difference between ppi and I love that the letters are way darker than the Paperwhite. The paperwhite had a grey hue to them and I didn't feel like I was reading a book. I felt like I actually holding a technical device to read a book. Of course since this doesn't have a backlight, you cannot read in the dark. It's common sense. If you want to read at night, purchase a little book light that are super inexpensive and attach it to your kindle. It's not a big deal and you're not going to break the bank buying a 119.99 item when you can buy this little awesome e-book reader for 79.99. Think about when the light runs out of your expensive other e-books...Read more",
SanDisk Ultra 64 GB class 10 used as extra storage space for Surface RT. Everything worked as expected. Well worth the money.,
"I have been using this card for about a month now, in my Contour ROAM 2 camera, and it has performed flawlessly. I have not had any issues, and have deleted and re-used several times. So far, so good!",
"Thank God for amazon return policy or I would be incensed.  This little platic device from hell died unexpectedly after 37 days.  I lost all my phone pictures that were not stored on the phone.  I lost the music but have most on PC.  I lost the videos I had from concerts.What happened was the phone gave me a warning that the storage device (Sandisk Ultra) could not be found.  I took it out and restarted my Galaxy Note 2 and it worked.  then about one hour later I got the same warning.  I tried to save my data with MY Backup Pro App (I had to purchase an extra 3 GBs of data for cloud because the App comes with only 75 MB or something like that and so I backed up everything on the Sandisk Storage).  And as it was backing everything on line  using the Backup Pro Cloud, the Sandisk fried and stopped the backup process.  I was prompted to format the storage disc but everytime I performed this process, the phone would not complete the format.  Now keep in mind that I was not near a computer because I was on vacation so I could not use a computer to format in Fat32.I am returning this disc and purchasing a Samsung 32 GB that costs over 50 bucks.  You get what you pay for.",
"I currently have all my downloaded music on this car sitting in my surface RT.  I haven't done any measurements on how fast the transfer rate of this card is, but I can tell you that it is fully capable of playing music and videos from the card to my Surface RT with no lag at all.  It was also a very good value as far as price/size/speed ratio.",
"There are many things I like about Amazon Fire TV, but I get tired of having to reset it a lot of times. I have to unplug and plug it in after every use with Netflix. For some reason the screen turns white the second time I use the app ( would be great if you could fix this issue) Considering it took me an hour to get it initially started because of an update, which makes no sense for a new product it has worked so so... It freezes up when streaming videos on HULU a good bit. I would like to have the option to remove shows from your watch list, especially when I view a show for the first time and don't like it. Sometimes the shows will start and then go right back to the homepage. This should not be happening without a button being depressed. I guess everything new has bugs but my question would be when is Amazon going to update the product and fix some of these bugs",
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
"I have purchased this SD card to have extra storage area for my Galaxy Note 2.  As you might already know, Galaxy Note 2 does not allow applications to run from external cards, but it allows storing media, documents, etc to the external card.  It also comes with a full size SD card conversion piece (just insert the micro sd card into the full size SD card piece and voila) - with it's current pricing on Amazon.com, this card is highly recommended.  Hope this review proves to be useful.Cheers",
"Love it, use it to store videos and photos on a Galaxy S3. Good stuff no problems yet like with my bootleg Transcend card.",
I really enjoy the generous storage space that my Samsung Galaxy SIII has. Every once in a long while I have to unmount/remount the drive but I doubt it's the card and most likely the phone. I would highly recommend.,
"This is a good case that provides adequate protection for your new 8 inch 2017 Kindle Fire. Inside it features a plastic frame that you snap your Kindle into. The frame solidly holds your Kindle into place and also covers the corners of the tablet and protects it during drops. The case weighs in at 4.66 ounces.The exterior of the case is a fiber cover that looks stylish. It is available in canary yellow, charcoal black, cobalt blue, marine blue and punch red. The one in my video is marine blue. The top cover has magnets in it that hold the cover closed and also tightly attach it to the back surface of the case when the cover is fully opened.The cover also has magnets in it that turn off the tablet when you close the cover and turn it on when you open the cover. I like that feature as it helps to conserve battery power. The inside surface of the cover is a micro fiber material and that protects your tablet screen from scratches when the cover is closed.I like that the micro SD card slot is covered when the tablet is installed in the case. That helps to protect the SD card from being lost or quickly stolen. A large memory size SD card can cost 47 to almost 100 and the added security is helpful.The tablets speakers are uncovered when the tablet is opened and when it is properly stood up in the landscape mode so you can watch a video. I show this in my product video. All of the top controls and ports are available while the tablet is in the case. That includes the volume controls, the headphone jack, the microphone, the power charging port and the power on/off button.The cover flap can be partially folded to allow you to stand the tablet into the portrait mode or in the landscape mode for reading, browsing the Internet or watching movies.Read more",
I bought this for my Raspberry Pi.  It is large enough to run a full LAMP server.  The price / speed are a good bargain.,
This was the perfect addition to my Surface tablet.  It came in easy to open packaging and it worked from the moment I pout it in the Microsoft Surface tablet.  Expanded my 32 g tablet to a lot more storage for movies and music.,
"Great price, Great function, works in my cannon camera, my Note 3 and I could not be happier with this purchase",
"These days, who doesn't need plenty of storage to move your apps, photos and other stuff to keep your phone running smoothly? Great price with no chance running out if space for a long time.",
Great price and it works perfectly in the Hero 3. No need to pay the store's high prices for these type of items. Amazon is the way to go.,
After I ordered my GoPro Hero 3 Black  I started searching for a good MicroSD card and everywhere I looked they wanted like $80for a 64GB  and digging around on eBay get's retarded at times  then by chance I found this one for $55 TTD  and the performance is awesomeI tell you all if you are in the market for a GoPro Hero3 Black  get this card to go with it  you wont be sorry....,
"1. While a great idea to make the cover self-standing, it's annoying that it's floppy when not in use.2. I bought the cover because my first Kindle didn't have a cover and often got left on, wearing down the battery. My second Kindle cover had the convenient feature of automatically opening and closing the device. So I wanted that feature on my third Kindle. Even though I think it's over priced, I like the convenience.3. My other cover was black, which often got lost on dark surfaces. This time I got the denim blue, so it's much easier to find from a distance.",
Way less than anything I could get in a big box store. No issues with the card this far. Would buy again and again.,
"Really fast shipment, I got it within 2 days of ordering. Even faster though was this 64GB microSDXC card. I've been using it with my Canon T3i DSLR and it's been a big upgrade in storage for my photos. I've used it for about a month now and it still lives up to its Class 10 speed and reliability. It transfers almost twice as fast as my old 32GB Transcend SD card.The only thing odd was the shipping box it came in... It was the size of a laptop box but inside was an envelope with this SDXC card. Seemed like quite a big environmentally unfriendly waste in packaging!",
"This is an SD card.  Nothing exciting, except when they don't work, I suppose... but this thing worked perfectly.  I put it in my VivoTab Windows 8.1 device, and it worked perfectly.  It has about 59GB of formatted free space on it... typical, but most folks expect to get to use the full 64GB... I heartily recommend this device!!!",
"We have always used Samsung tablets and so this took a little while adjusting how to navigate.So, far we have been using this for about a week and it does take some time to set-up. You will need to go through and make sure all the settings are correct for your kid, and this will take some time (I think the effort is worth it)This review is specifically for the Kids Edition tablet:The tablet:The tablet itself, is a good size for my (almost) 3 yr old. It is not heavy and seems to be the right size for him to handle. The protective case has definitely done its job because we have already had a couple of incidents. (update: this has been thrown against a wall and landed on tile, and no cracks or breaks) The viewing quality is decent. Otherwise, it is what you would expect from a tablet. I have not had another Fire before, so I can only compare this to a Samsung Galaxy, and so far, it is what I would expect from a tablet of this class.The features (the real reason for the purchase):is it worth it YES. DEFINITELYPreviously, we had been sharing our tablet and our phones with our little one, but more and more he would get into content he should not be getting into - everything from buying stuff and watching content not appropriate for his age - ie our downloads of Deadpool and Logan because these look like 'superheroes' but they are not the appropriate ones for kids - (side note: I loved how they portrayed Deadpool and Logan - we are big comic fans and they finally got their characters right!).I have even deleted YouTube from our tablets and hidden the app in our phones in files so that he can't get at them...But this tablet has been a game changer. It has GREAT parental controls.Read more",

The battery life has been tested during a camping trip. 8 hours and it kept the charge! It's also easy to recharge it without the stand. Very Cool.

"Having been a little overwhelmed by the choices between all the new Kindles and which one to get, I ordered this new basic 79 Kindle first to take for a spin. So far, I like what I see. I also own a Kindle 3 so that's the only device I can really compare it to at this time (I think a comparison between other tablets and this Kindle is meaningless, this device is all about content and delivery):1. Form-factor - Compared to the Kindle 3, this Kindle feels more compact, lighter and easier to hold. My hands wrap around this better than K3. Reading books for a few hours at a stretch will be easier on this device compared to the K3. It is the lightest such device I have used compared to all previous Kindles and other tablets.2. Screen - I personally like the fact that there are no keys on the device and that keys come up on the screen when you need them. Delivers a better overall reading experience. However, navigating through the on-screen keyboard with the 5-way controller can be taxing if you need to do a lot of searching, and you might miss the full physical keyboard. I hardly search on the Kindle itself, I search for books on my laptop so this is a non-issue.3. Price! - At 79, you can't go wrong. Compared to buying paperback or hardcover editions, you will recover the cost of this in a matter of a few months because most Kindle content is priced cheaper than print editions (and you get it instantly, and can access it wherever you are). Not to mention all the free Kindle downloads available in the catalog.4. Display - almost the same E-ink display at the K3. No glare no reflection. You can sit in bright sunlight and read it just like a book. Page turns seem a lot faster on this compared to the K3.Read more",
"Great buy, works fine - very happy with it.",
I screwed up and orignally order wrong card.  So I needed this card quickly for a trip.  Ordered it and it arrived and put it in tablet andloaded it with files.  It has worked flawlessly for about a month now.Thanks,
"I've had this memory card in my S3 for the past few months without any issues. The only problem I've had with this was when I initially copied the 30GB of data from my old card to this card. I had this connected to my laptop using a MicroSD USB adapter and the copies kept failing. I figured out that the card was overheating when writing a lot of data. I was able to copy the data by pointing a small desk fan towards the card adapter during the file copy process. That being said, I don't have any read/write problems due to overheating with the card installed in my phone. I've copied over a couple of gigs of movies to watch on some trips with the card installed in the phone without any failures. It may be that heat issue only occurs after pushing &#62;3GB of data at a time. The largest movie I copied to the phone was 2GB. Most of the other movies are just over a gig.The only prep work for use in my phone was the initial format when it was first installed. The card was recognized prior to the formatting but I had seen where others had read/write issues so the format was a preemptive move.",
"I like this SD Card because it can take music video downloads, personal videos, files,docs, and multimedia images with a fast transfer rate of Class 10 speed. It can take games with large files very easily and still have enough space for apps. It&#34;s great for video cameras and camcorders with the supplied adapter. Fits very easily into smartphones and tablets SD Card slots. I recommend this 32GB SD Card to everyone.",

"Having used SanDisk before in my photography, I of course went to them when it was time to outfit my new Samsung Galaxy S3 with an internal microSD card. I spent the extra bucks over comparably ""no name"" Micro SD cards and bought this variant. I took quite a few pictures and even transferred an album from my computer so I coud show it to friends on the go.After less than two months, the SanDisk microSD card started acting up. It was not recognized, stopped, restarted, removed itself, reinstalled itself onto the phone - erratic behavior. Here is where I should have taken it out immediately and tried to recover anything I could before things hit the fan...unfortunately I waited too long and this morning, for no other reason than I turned my phone on, the card shows up as blank. Neither my Windows PC, nor my Mac, can even detect the card and yes, i tried two different adapters, and I tried the SanDisk recovery which ""found no recoverable files"" even though I checked all file type extensions.I've apparently lost all the pictures I had on there. To top it all off, my GF's cheap ""no name"" card has never had an issue in her exact same phone and keeps chugging along merrily.Paying a premium for a substandard product that fails in use after two months? No thanks. I'm going back to Lexar, which hasn't failed me yet. I'm also getting rid of all my SanDisk cards for my DSLR's, just in case. The fact that SanDisk is the first card thats ever failed on me, and a new card to boot, does not inspire confidence. Buy and use at your own risk.",

"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more",

Not much to say about his SanDisk mIcroSD card. I needed something with more storage and it serves it's purpose.,

I do not trust the transfer speed test because there are so many factors that change the outcome (card reader, USB version, hard drives, and etc).",
Put this in my cell phone and loaded it up. It works like a charm and have had no problems what so ever with it. It worked right out of the box. I would buy another one if needed.,
It stores data and does a good job at it. What else can you say about something that has become so common place in today's world?,
I'm amazed the sound quality out of this little speaker unit set up is easy and I recommend it,
"SanDisk makes the most reliable SD cards. After working in Tech support for a company that relied on maps loaded on SD cards, I only recommend SanDisk now. Class 10 is great, it means you have the fastest card made.

"Super fast access to my Samsung Galaxy Note II. SanDisk Ultra Micro HC is blazing fast compared to the other microSD cards I have bought including PNY, Sony and more!",
this small but big in memory will be the perfect gift for a samsung tablet.i am pretty sure she will love it.,
"I bought the first Kindle when it came out and, while I liked it, I didn't use it that much because the page turn buttons could be too easily triggered, and the cover was somewhat clumsy to use. The second generation Kindle was a lot better, but I still preferred to read physical books with the Kindle being a solution for being able to have books available without taking up any more space (I still buy physical books, but most are donated to the local library, Salvation Army, etc. after I've read them).Next, about a year after it came out, I bought what Amazon called the Kindle Keyboard and was hooked! I began using the Kindle as a preferred reading medium over physical books and thought that the Kindle Keyboard couldn't be improved upon (I've since given a couple as gifts). I liked the storage capacity, the 3G capability and thought I wouldn't want to be without the keyboard. After reading more than seventy books on it I couldn't imagine trying a Kindle with less memory and only Wi-fi.I was wrong.I ordered this 4th Generation Kindle earlier this year, thinking I'd have it for a backup to my Kindle Keyboard. Instead, it has become my much-preferred device. Storage room With the cloud, it's really not an issue. I keep a few reference books on both of my current Kindles (the Keyboard and this one) as well as what I'm currently reading. I haven't had any problem with coming close to exceeding the storage capacity. While it would be nice to have 3G, it's not a deal-killer at all. I've already read close to 50 books on this Kindle and I've only found myself without easy access to Wi-fi once. When I'm close to finishing a book, I plan ahead and download a new one (or two) so that I'm ready wherever I happen to be.Read more",
I bough this to replace an old 1gb card I had in my phone. I am using this in a Nokia Lumia 822 and it works perfectly.,
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
Not too much to say about it other than it's a class 10 card for a cheep price. I've had for about a month and it works perfectly. My old card was the basic black HC and failed after about a year and a half.,
These things are supposed to work flawlessly aren't they? Anyway this does. Didn't need to format it in my S4 - went straight in no probs.,
Package arrived before estimated time (well Done). Installed in Galexy Optimus Pro and was recognized immediately. Is working well expanding room for pics and apps.,
I use this in my Galaxy Tab 3 It is great and I have not had any issues with it.,
My granddaughter's phone was slowing down. She had a 2gb memory card in it and no room for any more photos. She transferred all 499 photos to this 32gb card and has room for many more. Love making her happy!,
Does everything its supposed to do.  Haven't been able to really test speed in a video camera to see if its really Class 10.  Given its from SanDisk I expect everything is good.  Great price.,
"Within an hour of using the memory card, it failed and died. it kept saying &#34;Memory error.&#34;I could never get my dashcam camera to record anything. I went to our walmart and got me just MicroSD not Ultra. It has been working all day so far.That's right. There is no way to tell what you are getting online is OEM or knock offs. When the price is too good to be true, it probably is - made and distributed by Mofia. LOL.Although the package arrived on time, I will never buy this product online or from this seller on Amazon. Waste of money.",
"I read reviews for all the Amazon echo products, and decided the portability and the full size of the Tap made it the right product for me. It lives up to my expectations. It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few ""I didn't understand that"" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists. I picked the Tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio, and can be recharged overnight.",
"I'm a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to compare the latest Kindle to. I don't own a Nook. I don't own an iPad (and, in any case, that's comparing apples to oranges). I don't have a Sony e-reader. 'This will be a short, simple review.I received my Kindle about a week ago and haven't been able to put it down.Things I like about my Kindle1. The e-ink display is amazing.2. Using the 5-way controller is simple and effective.3. Page turn speeds are faster than I thought they would be.4. It's lightweight, even with the attached cover (I have an Amazon cover with a built-in light)5. Page-turning buttons are quiet and well-placed.6. Recharge time is fast.7. I can order a book and start reading it in less than 60 seconds. Nice!8. Portability... I can take 3,000 books with me when I travel for work and not require additional suitcases or baggage fees.Things I'm not too keen on1. Buttons are too close together and are laid out oddly.2. Lack of individual number buttons is frustrating.3. Power button on the bottom Not a bad thing. Just an odd thing. (Same for the headphone input). I usually rest the bottom of a book on my lap when I read.Things I hope change in the future1. How books are organized... When I put a book in a collection (which is actually a tag), it still appears in the main list. It's not actually moved, it's merely associated.2. The look of the main screen. I'd like folders or some other way to display collections.3. Ability to create personal screen savers.4. E-book pricing, though Amazon has little control over this. Still, most titles are the same price as or less than their hardback/paperback counterparts.Read more",
Ordered several of these as they are much cheaper then at Best Buy. Use in my GoPro and they work great. I prefer several 32GBs over 64GBs just in case they do get corrupted you aren't losing as much data.,
"This Micro SD card is solid and has a great performance. It's really a fast reading SD Card, I would say 4 times faster than any previous cards I had in the past. Once I placed the card in my phone, and I turned it on, you could see the difference. Every application I have in my cell phone that is in my SD card, works really flawlessly. A great product, very solid performance.",
"So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.Thanks for letting me rant",
"This works well in my Galaxy S4. I use it for media storage. I did have to reseat it once as I kept getting an error about ""Preparing SD Card,"" but I think that was more about how I put it in my phone than about this media. I think that this is a pretty good value to extend storage on a phone.UPDATE - I deducted a star because this card has a capacity of 32 billion bytes, but not 32 GB. There is a difference. The storage is actually around 29 GB because 32,000,000,000 / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 = 29.8 GB. It's still a very good value and I would still recommend it highly, but do understand that you are not getting 32 GB.",
It fits in my phone. It holds lots of stuff. It comes with a reader that works in my laptop.,
"This was a birthday gift from my daughter. (71st birthday--certified old guy) What might I do with an Echo I bought a 3 Kindle book on using an Echo. Later I discovered most of what is in the book is probably in the on board helps, but the book makes a nice linear presentation that does not make me guess what I need to search out, and a Kindle book makes it easy for me to make notes I can find later with ease.I am using my Echo primarily as a radio. In the early 1990s I worked on my German skills by listening to a lot of shortwave radio. Most of that is now on the Internet. I could listen on my smart phone, but that uses phone battery reserves. The Echo runs on AC power from a wall outlet. The little speaker is adequate for voice broadcasts. I listen for hours to German news magazines. I can also listen to some old favorite broadcasts from Radio Canada.We live where my favorite talk radio program comes in poorly due to another station very near on the dial. But, our WiFi reaches my garage workshop and I have clear audio through Tune In. (I am having trouble linking iHeart Radio, perhaps because my subscription is not paid.)When I have asked Alexa a question she sometimes tells me she cannot answer a question I thought simple enough.I did ask for some music and was surprised to find CDs I bought as gifts are in Amazon's cloud for me to hear over Echo. Nice!",
"Echo Dot in my GMC Sierra Denali. At first she was just there with no support. She sat in that hole with no protection. Shifting, jiggling not knowing what can happen. There has to be something I can do. I looked and search and what I found is the Fabric Case for Alexa. This is it! A support she will be happy to wear. No more accidental popping out, no more shifting and readjusting, she is finally safe.",
"Great but i still dont know how to use it to store my apps on the surface, the only reason why i bought this thing",
"Glad I purchased this item for use with my Samsung Galaxy s3, Im able to record video in HD or store almost anything you'd wanna have on your cell phone or etc..",
Great card that is very fast and reliable. It comes with an optional adapter for SD slots. Being that this is a Class 10 card it transfers data really fast and for video this is a must! Great for GoPros and other small cameras alike.,
"What is there to say? It's a nice big, cheap, effective, micro SD card. I use it in my Galaxy Note 8.0 for extra storage and it works fine.",
"I already had an original Kindle Paperwhite and loved it. Buying this in addition seemed like a bit of an indulgence but I am so pleased I made this move. I love the new font and the clarity of the screen. I love that the Kindle comes to life when I open the cover (I bought a new cover with the magnetic clasp). While there is nothing dramatic about the evolving of the Kindle there are enough changes and improvements for me to feel I have made a great purchase which I am happy with. I also have a bunch of books from my Amazon.co.uk site which I access on my 'old' Kindle (I couldn't work out how, if at all, I can move books from one Amazon jurisdiction to another) so this has proved a good purchase all round.",
"If you are going to add more storage to you android tablet, this is the one for you. I recommend this SSD Card.",
Great concept but speaker not so good at full volume. And maybe better now with the updates,
The family really enjoys the Amazon Tap. This is an awesome investment. We talk to Alexa everyday.,
"Bought it as a gift, she loves it. Very entertaining and wonderful volume, having lots of fun with it.",
"I held off on rating this item until I had a chance to evaluate its performance. I am glad I made the purchase. This memory card is just what I needed. It has given me a steady, and strong performance. The access time to games and photos is very acceptable. As to the unspoken problems with the Galaxy s4,I have not had a problem at this point. My card has not dismounted, nor have I experienced any failure on the memory cards part.",
"Amazon Tap is a great device. The device has very good audio quality despite it's small size. The biggest difference between this and the larger Amazon Echo, is that you have to press the ""microphone"" button before the device will listen to you (which is great for people who are concerned that the Echo is always listening to what you say). So far, the battery life has been great. With the Alexa app, it is very easy to connect this device to different Wi-Fi networks.",
"Works great in my android, fast, holds a ton of music and works well. How much can I say about a memory card. :-)",
This micro card has been seamless and simple to use.  The phone has not had any problems with this card.,
"I was so shocked! So, I was going through a book for my PhD dissertation, highlighting parts for further citations in my project. When I was done with it, I realised that instead of scrolling back all the pages of my e-book, looking for the highlights, I can just export them to my e-mail in PDF file. This is life changing for me! I have always preferred paper books to e-books, but this option is a miracle. It saved me hours of work! I am a very happy customer!",
"I had this for my smart phone and it kept dismounting itself.  I did some research and found out that there are others experiencing the same problem.  So, I returned this and got Transcend instead.  Transcend works fine with no problem.",
"I love it hut I think I should have got the bigger one, but its entertaining",
"stil not getting the write speed as I need, but considering the cost /capacity /speed it is a good card!",
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
Unerstand that these cards may come in different formats.  I had to reformat on a Windows XP machine after finding a HP utility via Google to get this to work properly in my SAMSUNG Galaxy Note 2.,
"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!",
"I do not know if the GS3's have issues with reading cards of this size but I eventually had to remove this card and purchase a Transcend 8GB Class 10 card just to check if it was my phone that was the problem. When I got it I opened the packet, and popped it right in. Recognized, was able to start using, taking shots and video and they immediately saved to the card without the hangup my old class 2 card used to have. After a couple of days I noticed that I would take a shot and the phone would give me an error that it could not save to the SD card. You would have to reboot to fix. When scrolling through the gallery on the SD card it would freeze and the app would crash. I moved what I could, formatted the card but the same thing kept happening.Since installing the new Transcend 8GB card I've had no such issues. Maybe its just MY phone but I think there have been enough complaints from GS3 owners to be a little skeptical about this card on their phones.",
"Can't beat the price and quality for the capacity. I always buy these chips from Amazon. SanDisk chips have worked well for me. No problems with read/right, no lost data.",
I take lots of pics with my phone (Samsung 4S) and this helps free up space on my phone. I've not had any issues with it so far.,
Sounds great. Must touch to activate. Easy to use.,
Seems to work fine in my Samsung . Galaxy III with the new android 4.1.1 os How big of a card can this phone handle&#62;  Anyone know?,
"Definitely a class 10 and works as intended, transferred large video files (tv shows and movies) at a rate of 11-13MB/s consistently, played the files I transferred over to my TF700 and the 720p/1080p bluray's played without any problems.",
"I have purchased several Sandisk sd cards for its reliability and function. This is just one of the purchases and I will be ordering more. It works for my tablet, camera and computer. Love it !",
I install it in my new Moto E and works great. It can save a lots of photos and it isn't slow.,
"Nice memory card.  I think 16 gb is the sweetspot for price and size, can't imagine filling it.  I only buy class-10 cards just in case a little speed boost is important.  I have this in an Android 4.2 player, works great.",
"The data speeds are kinda slow but I am enjoying this card and thinking of buying a 64GB, nice buy.",
"I'm amazed.  I ordered this from Amazon on Tuesday morning, and it arrived with Wednesday's mail.  VERY impressive service from Amazon!As has already been reported, the card formats out to > 59 Gb, and it performs perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy S III (which is also new).  Using two card readers on a fast PC, I transferred everything from my old 16GB card to the new 64 GB card in less time than it took to walk to the kitchen and get a cup of coffee.  So I think the Class 10 rating is correct on the card.Once I have some experience with the card in the phone, I'll benchmark the card and I'll also benchmark operations such as internally backing up my Android phone to the card.  Then I'll update this review with some accurate numerical data.  But in the mean time on first look, the person who said that the S 3 has problems with anything faster than class 6 may not have been correct - a full backup of the phone to the card was significantly faster than the backup with the old 16GB class 6 card.  Again no benchmarks yet but once I have them I'll include them here.Right now I'm very happy with this card and I'm really impressed - both with the card and with the unbelievably quick service from Amazon (and I'm in Atlanta where shipments like this one often take the full 3 days to arrive).",
I got this for my 3 year old's Nabi. I can put tons of movies and tv shows on this thing and keep her entertained for hours. For the price it's hard to beat.,
"I put this in my Verizon Samsung Galaxy Stellar and it works perfectly. This is an easy way to add memory for pictures, music and apps, etc, to the phone",
"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",

Nothing much to say other than it works just fine and it has great price. Needed another one for my phone after my first one got corrupted after a systems update. Just a tip: If you phone prompts you for an update you might want to take the card out before doing so; I corrupted two cards that way.,
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
"I bid on a 64 gb micro SDXC on ebay which never worked to start out with and realized it too late to return.  The multiple issues I had with my newly purchased Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 was caused by the inferior memory card.  All the problems with the tablet disappeared once this memory card was inserted.  Lesson learned, any technology accessories should be purchased from a reputable retailer like Amazon to ensure quality of product.",
"Overall, a great purchase with a reasonable price. I have bought 4 units and all working well in various devices",
"Recently upgraded to Samsung Note II. I've been wanting to carry more of my music. Turns out I only had a total of 12GB of music. But with the new 64GB card, that still gives me another 52GB for my photos, spreadsheets, word docs and PDF docs. I've been listening to my music stored on this card--No delays.",
Works well in my GoPro even though it wasn't one of the GoPro recommended ones.  A good buy that has the speed for movies and big pictures.,
I returned to order a 11.6 laptop so I could have full operations than having a Notebook. I am sure this is good quality as I have purchased San Disk numerous times.,
"I use this with my Samsung Note II.  Previously I had iPhones, but it is very expensive to get an iPhone with enough memory for all my songs.  For a fraction of the price with my Samsung, they're all there wherever a go.",
"Comes with a lifetime warranty.  Had one fail once, sent it back to SanDisk, they sent me a new one!I have been using SanDisk for years.  That was the only time one ever failed!!!",
Nothing much to say here. Works great and I haven't lost a single picture or video saved on here so far. Read/Write speeds are excellent.  I've been using this for a few months on my Samsung Galaxy S4 and I have no complaints.,
This microSDHC card makes its job pretty well. It is fast enough to rely your data on any mobile device. Haven't had any complaints so far.,
Can't go wrong with this item.  Have purchased none other than SanDisk for use with my dash camera.,
I am now awaiting a replacement from Sandisk because it failed after the Amazon return period.  Always had good luck with Sandisk cards until now.  Phone and PC simply stopped seeing the card.  Lost all of my data (which i fortunately had backed up elsewhere).,

"It reaches read speed of about 24MB/s and write speed of about 18MB/s at optimal situation.Other than the speed, everything is fine. I'd like to say the color is quite a good thing, because MicroSD could be so small that you put it away for a few seconds it will easily disappear. With the bright read and light grey color, it is much easier to find, because it will not blend into common background.Also, the quality looks good, not like some of the MicroSD cards, this is a ""unibody"" design that you cannot tell from appearance that where is the circuits. The SD card adapter come with it is in quite good quality too.In summery, good design, good quality, not too satisfying speed. It will be a judgement call to say if it worth it or not. But to me I can totally go with it.",
"Purchased for use with a smartphone.  Works flawlessly, has given me much more space than I think I can use - but we'll see.  That's what I always say at the beginning.  It works without me noticing it is there so to me that is what I pay for.  I think this was a great price and I'm pleased with the purchase.",
This SanDisk brand is one of the most accurate and secure for SD memory cards. I recommend it for sure.,
Sooo quick. great deal on a great product. No problems with unmounting on my Samsung galaxy s3. Would definitely buy again.,
"This product arrived in two days (Prime), it was exactly what I ordered and it works great in my Galaxy S3. I know a class 10 is not exactly needed in a cell phone but it cannot hurt, right? I'm very happy with this purchase.",
"I use this with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, and it has worked seamlessly. I use it to store movies to watch while travelling, and haven't had an issue yet. The transfer speed is great and Playing movies from the card has not been a problem.",
Works well with my dslr. Have never been able to fill it. I guess 16gb would be enough for average use. Go for faster speeds and smaller size.,
"I bought two of these one for Asus infinity and one for Samsung galaxy s3 international version. It worked fine with my Asus but it didn't work on my phone. I formatted this card using the phone,the tablet and my laptop  but didn't work I did some tests with apps using some apps nothing showed its not working the only way I got it to work is by formatting it in my Canon SLR camera.",
"Excellent quality memory; good deal for the price! It functioned perfectly, good speed, and meets all my needs. I would definitely recommend for anyone using tablets. I am planning to buy another one shortly.",
Does what is suppose to do. Good price. The delivery and shipong was fast. This isy third piece. I use it for my dash- car cameras.,
"Bought two separately.1) One was a frustration free package one was apparently a frustrating package. Both came in similar packages stuffed in large yellow envelopes. Don't really see the difference between the frustration free and frustrating one. The frustrating one just required scissors, no real attempt of making it a &#34;greener&#34; package was really attempted (that I could tell), nor did it matter since it was put into a giant envelope anyway.2) One was sent USPS, the other ParcelPool. I've had bad experiences before with ParcelPool (as have many people apparently) but I guess Amazon gave them an earful because it actually arrived on time this time. The &#34;tracking&#34; for ParcelPool is still a huge joke though.3) Actual product: it's a MicroSD card, it does exactly what it's supposed to do. No problems with it.",
"With the adapter, I can use this with DSLRs and other video-capturing items that demand a lot of data transferred faster.  It's pretty crucial especially when you can snap off 10 to 15 photos per second to get some really good sequences and every little bit helps when your files are 8MB a piece.",
Want to try one and Best Buy put up the best price. Th tap is good for usage on the wifi network. Use it to play music outside around the house.,
Sandisk once again lives upto its name as the pioneer. This SD card fits the need of today high performance apps and has excellent durability and fast transfer speeds.,
This rocks with my galaxy s3 android. I've got it loaded with movies and pictures for the slow times in my taxi.,
Purchased for use as add-on memory for Motorola RAZR Maxx Phone.  Works great.  Package arrived as scheduled.  All is good.,
I tried this both on Android tablets and the MS Surface.Pros:-True Class 10 read and write speeds-Works with Android phones/tablet and the new Surface tabletCons:-None so far.,
"Purchased my first one with the TV Fire box over a year ago and now it is gone, purchased a second one but you would think Amazon would do a better in taking care of some people having the same problem with them.My daughter can control the box from her iPhone as another person listed so we may send the order back for refund after it gets here tomorrow.I do have two fire sticks as well in the bedrooms and no problems with those.",
"SANDISK is now processing my RMA.  It was used in my Galaxy Note 2.  Its been over a week since I mailed it out. Fortunately they paid for shipping, but while it was working, it was awesome.. 64 gigabytes of class 10 accessible data, at the hands of your finger tips, literally MICRO SD sized.  wow, how technology has improved.",
"Can be used with my phone as well as with my computers, thanks to the included adapter. I use these to back up/store pictures and documents instead of a separate external hard drive... I just put a number on the disk, as well as a numbered label on the plastic storage case it comes with, so I can remember what is on which disk. Easy to use and store!",
"Love this micro sd card, but love the fact that I was able to buy it at such a great price!",
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
I used to use an 8GB one n I recently upgraded to this one as I have bigger need. Put it into my mobile as soon as I got it n it works well. Quite easy to use n I use it for storing all my music/ pictures on my mobile n sometimes upload movies when I go on long drives. Sandisk is a great brand n its definitely worth it.,
Was able to copy all items from old memory card to this one. plugged it into the phone without formatting it and works like a charm. I have the Galaxy S3,
"Great chip, bought it for use in my raspberry pi projects as linux hard drive.Very fast.Real deal.Price was excellent.Nice to get real chip, instead of cheap nock off, often sold as brand name card.",
"Great read and write speed compared to my old Transcend, of course that was a 4 class. and this is a UHS 1. I am very satisfied with the price I got it at, and Sandisk Limited Lifetime warranty.oh yeah I asked for the Original Manufacturers packaging, but I got Amazon's frustration free packaging instead. No big deal though.",
"I have a first generation Kindle Fire, it did every well, but was heavy and not as fast as I hoped graphics wise for gaming, which is why I upgraded to the HDX. This new tablet is blisteringly fast and completely fluid with no lag. Movies, books, and games are crystal clear, and I can now even read PDF's easily, which was a chore on the old Kindle Fire. The best part is the battery life and light weight, I use this kindle all day on one charge. I'm so happy with it, considering the 8.9 inch also for my wife.I can think of no flaws, but if a problem comes up with this device, I'll update, I've only had it a week.",
Work well with my android phone.  And came at a good price.  No problems whatsoever.  I would highly recommend these to anyone.,
"I bought this for a friend of mine to put some videos on it.  Initially, when plugged into the computer, we couldn't find the storage in the directory.  However, after finding a micro sd to usb adapter...bingo!  Worked like a charm after that.  Install the videos, plugged the card in the phone, and we were off to the races.Not sure if we needed the adapter, but we couldn't get the computer to recognize it.  We also used a Linux O/S.  Go figure.",
"I didn't  even have this card installed in my Motorola  Razor HD for 6 months when I turned my phone on yesterday and got a message stating I removed my card before properly unmounting it first even though it was still installed. I plugged it into my PC adapter and nothing! I lost about 300 documents and over 500 pictures, but i'm glad that I just backed up everything 2 weeks ago. Worked great until it died far to soon and without any warning at all. Be sure to backup all your important data frequently!",
"UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:br /br /My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.br /br /Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.br /br /The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.br /br /I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.br /br /The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.br /br /For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more",
"I got my memory card here instead of on the gopro site and saved some money. Its the same card and it works awesome. This card is about 7 hours of 720 @30 frames per second, or about 4 hours of 720@60 frames or 1080 @30 frames. In a gopro, you will be burning through batteries way before you could ever fill these cards. I prefer more, smaller cards. If a card dies, it is less of a catastrophe and you also dont pay that premium for the larger cards. However, If I do a LONG time lapse with a battery source, having a large card is nice to have.",
"Smaller then what i expecting, alexa sounds loud and clear. Music sounds great, just make sure you enable alexa hands free so you dont have to hit the button",
"Amazon ran a good deal on this 64GB microSDXC, so I jumped on the bandwagon.  When it arrived I snapped a few photographs to test it out and it worked well...until I tried to retrieve the files.  I don't know how, but it became corrupt and no longer would reformat or function in any of my devices.  I exchanged it for a replacement through Amazon and the new one works beyond my initial observations.  Browsing seems much faster than previous SDHC class 10 cards.  Thank you Amazon for your immediate exchange.  highly recommended for today's on the go data storage.  *(original review was 2 stars, but after Amazon's immediate replacement and great customer service I re-rated to 5 stars.)",
This card is great for any device that will accept a micro SDHC.  Class 10 write speed is a big bonus for recording high definition video!  I am very satisfied with this purchase.,
"It's very easy to connect devices, and it produces a good sound. I'm very pleased with this purchase.",
It is a great addition to my home office. My Alexa is upstairs.,
"I have copied and transported a large amount of data and it work, and no errors.  I will purchase more of these.",
"I replaced the brown suede cover that came with my Kindle because I'd dropped it a couple of times, and it had problems staying connected. It wouldn't charge so it was pretty much useless. I went with the leather cover because the suede cover, while nice to touch, did get worn(I had one on my old Kindle Paper White), so I decided a leather cover would be better. The color is as lovely as a glass of Merlot and stays connected so far. I love using this new Kindle Oasis because it's so much lighter than my old Paper White.",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
I purchased this product a few months back as a replacement for another 32GB Sandisk memory card that wasn't even a year old that ceased to work. After using this memory card for a few months I started having the same problem where the card randomly stops working or is not even recognized by my Galaxy S3 phone. I tried plugging it into my computer with the provided adapter and it seldom gets recognized. This card is not worth the money for it will not last. Buy PNY or any other brand. Sandisk has lost a customer.03/12/2013 - Amazon.com rocks! They refunded the full amount of the purchase! Kudos to them!,
Using this in a Samsung Note II phone and I get reads of 18M/sec and writes of 9M/sec. very pleased with the performance.,
"Bought this for my Nook HD and it works perfectly without any problems.  I already used about 80% capacity with HD movies, and my Nook HD plays them flawlessly.  Very happy with the product.",
Use is all the time. Backyard favorite. Great by the fire.,
"Bought it for my phone, a Samsung Galaxy SIII. Seems to work just fine. Not much else to say. It does what it is suppose to do.",
"Bought the Echo Tap, Echo Dot, Phillips Hue Starter Kit and a Honeywell Thermostat for my wife for her birthday.She loves it and so do I!Cant wait to add more automated products to it. No need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature, check weather, play music, etc., I just ask Alexa to do it while I continue at what I'm doing.Also, when the Dot and Tap are in the same room, the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests. Nice device that will only improve with time.",
I used it and it worked fine. i try to buy many of sandisk products more often but its a bit pricey,
"Ordered this for a Galaxy S3.  Lasted a few months and then broke.  Is not accessible on several different PC's.Says ""limited lifetime"" warranty - BS.  You have ONE MONTH for Eco Zone.  Not only did I lose pictures but now I am out $$ because of a crappy return policy.In the future I will be buying Kingston, not Sandisk.-----------------Update:  Amazon Customer service made good and refunded my purchase price.  I still will not be buying any more Sandisk memory cards however...",
"Family is using and loving the Tap more every day. Great to find out quick information like weather, general questions and sports scores. The battery life is awesome only having to charge it every two-three days depending on usage and we use it. Excellent wifi connectivity and seamless Bluetooth connection. Use it all over the house.",
"These cards worked flawlessly with the GoPro Hero 3+. Instead of opting for the bigger card, I got two smaller cards to start with. That way I could transfer data to my laptop while still using the other card. If you're wanting to do an un-assisted, large record, like a time-lapse, or something, opting for the bigger card is smart, but for my usage being able to swap back and forth was invaluable.So far, no hiccups or problems, even with the faster, more beefy shooting settings.",
I like the portability of the tap and the sound is nice. You can set it up to either push the microphone button to activate it or you can set it up like the echo where you just say Alexa.,
"excellent product.  great storage capacity.  super fast.  delivery was excellent as alwaysPros =- everythingcons: noneputting in more so I make 20 words. not much to say, it's a perfect product.  exactly what it says it is",
"I recently switched over from an iPhone to a S4 and I'm trying to get used to the lack of on board memory.  This card works well for me because most of my memory is used on pictures.  I'm still working my way around the actual phone and memory, but this serves me well.",
I bought this for my GoPro Hero 3 and it performed perfect! 15 minutes of video equaled about 3GB of memory.,
"This will work on an I717 note, just need to know how to get it to work,they say that the note can only go up to 32 gigs but that is not accurateI got this one to work on the note 1just format this with your computer with fat32 32kband presto you now have a lot of space for whatever you wishjust download the free version of easy US partition master and format the card using the settingsFAT32 with 32kbit worked for me",
After assuming I was stuck with a number of Micro SD adapters that didn't work I purchased the SanDisk Ultra card and low and behold everything started working. Even my wife's tablet that didn't recognize the SD cards movies started working. Bottom line it just works.,
I bought this as a gift for my father. He absolutely loves it!!,
"Phone's internal memory was nearly always full, so it was obvious I needed some more memory. SanDisk is reliable. The card performs to spec, and is fast!",
"I needed some space on my phone, bought this, has not given me any problems.It just works really well",
"get it $9.9,so worthful.speed is fine , camera  can use it with the adapter. so useful, i love it !",
I am enjoying it so far. Great for reading. Had the original Fire since 2012. The Fire used to make my eyes hurt if I read too long. Haven't experienced that with the Paperwhite yet.,

"Update on Dec 23 2013 - Please scroll to the very end of this review for 2 month use update. ...For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model. The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080). This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution. The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.Read more",

"Upon inserting my HC 16GB card from a Motorola Doid X into the Galaxy S3 my music would play very chopped and sometimes the files would not work at all.  This card not only cleared that problem up but allows me to put my whole music collection on the phone!  No complaints so far, does its job.",
Great card for a great price read and write speeds are on par with what is posted on the specifications detail report.,
I ordered this item to replace the one that no longer works. The directions for the new remove state to press the home button to go to the home screen (using the existing remote which does not work) You must use your existing remote for all the following steps. The existing remote DOES NOT WORK. This is why I bought a new one. I am sending all of this crap back to amazon and canceling this Fire subscription. This has been a problem from day one and we have only had this for a few months. Not worth the money.,
"If your card gets hot enough to be painful, it is defective and you need to contact SanDisk!From my experience, the larger micro SDs run hot on format and writing, but not to the pain threshold!I purchased one of these cards to use in a camera and Android tablet.  Great read speed but write speed was okay.  Used card for about two weeks and then all my files disappeared!  Tried to format the card and three different computers with XP, Windows, and Linux couldn't format it.  The camera and tablet couldn't format it.  I RMA'd it and got another because SanDisk is a good brand.  I did notice that when formatting or writing the card it got hot, very hot.Second card didn't last 24 hours and had the exact same symptoms as the first card.  Write a file or format it resulted in the card getting hot enough to reach the pain threshold.  I called up SanDisk and while explaining this was the second card I'd received with the exact same symptoms, when I mentioned it getting hot, they immediately issued me an RMA.  They said they were told to issue an RMA the moment they heard a card ran hot.Smaller SanDisk micro SD's or regular SD's I have or use don't do this.  I think SanDisk has an issue with this card.The last 4 digits of the part number refer to the date code and origin of the card.  Both cards had different date and origin codes.",
"What can I say that hasn't said already for this product, very fast delivery, excellent packaging, right price and it works perfect with my Samsung Galaxy SII.Looking forward to buy a 64GB for my new S4",

We're excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound, and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD. As you correctly point out, the new Kindle Fire HD is the successor to last year's entry level Kindle Fire, which does not include features such as camera, microphone, or HDMI port. You are also correct to point out that this device does not support Mayday, although there are still multiple ways to get help for free directly from your device. We hope you enjoy the new features and services. Thanks, The Kindle Team",
"I'm a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to compare the latest Kindle to. I don't own a Nook. I don't own an iPad (and, in any case, that's comparing apples to oranges). I don't have a Sony e-reader. 'This will be a short, simple review.I received my Kindle about a week ago and haven't been able to put it down.Things I like about my Kindle1. The e-ink display is amazing.2. Using the 5-way controller is simple and effective.3. Page turn speeds are faster than I thought they would be.4. It's lightweight, even with the attached cover (I have an Amazon cover with a built-in light)5. Page-turning buttons are quiet and well-placed.6. Recharge time is fast.7. I can order a book and start reading it in less than 60 seconds. Nice!8. Portability... I can take 3,000 books with me when I travel for work and not require additional suitcases or baggage fees.Things I'm not too keen on1. Buttons are too close together and are laid out oddly.2. Lack of individual number buttons is frustrating.3. Power button on the bottom Not a bad thing. Just an odd thing. (Same for the headphone input). I usually rest the bottom of a book on my lap when I read.Things I hope change in the future1. How books are organized... When I put a book in a collection (which is actually a tag), it still appears in the main list. It's not actually moved, it's merely associated.2. The look of the main screen. I'd like folders or some other way to display collections.3. Ability to create personal screen savers.4. E-book pricing, though Amazon has little control over this. Still, most titles are the same price as or less than their hardback/paperback counterparts.Read more",
Can't go wrong with this class 10 card cheap and works great may have to buy another one as a spare.,
I don't notice any significant performance increase over the less expensive class 4 sandisk sd card.  I don't recommend this card.,
"Before putting it into my phone I formatted and moved all the data over to it from my 16GB microSD. Popped it into my phone and has been in there for the last 4 months with no problems. Picked it up for about 27 bucks, very good deal.",
So far so good - boosts my table storage big time - now I can keep all my pics and music with me all the time - price and promptness was awesome,
"I use this hours a day. Whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo-device, the battery life, sound quality, and voice recognition is great.",
It's been working for over 4 years on my GP camera.  Has not crashed nor failed me.  I've shot over a hundred hours of footage on this card.  I will buy again for sure.,
"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more",
Haven't had much time to place items on this card yet.  Formatted to my Samsung Galaxy Tab no problem.  Seems to do the job will keep you posted if problems arise?,
Got this for my Samsung NOTE 2 - best investment ever!!  Plenty of room now!  Not a lot of lag time and does have almost the full 64 gbs available.,
Enjoying my Amazon Tap portable Bluetooth and Wi-F Speaker. It's everything I thought it would be an MORE!,
"I use this with my Contour ROAM on the race track, hasn't failed me yet. I would buy this again.",
If you want to listen to music you will have to sign for Amazon unlimited or Prime which is very expensive. Pandora does not work too well with this device as it does with Google Home.,
"Great product for the sale price, hard to beat 37$ for 64GB. Worked well on the PC, then on a Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet. Speed is nothing to write home about, but close to what manufacturer suggested (30/10)",
This is a very fast microSD card compared to the class 4 speeds. It looks nice and it works. I'm not sure what else I can say other than that I have no problems with it and it hasn't died on my yet.It's been about 4 months at least now in my Samsung Galaxy S3. The S3 had a reputation for breaking sandisk sd cards for some reason and it's only randomly unmounted about 3 times but easily remounted with a take out and put back in with maybe a restart on the phone to refresh some apps to see it. I think this is just because the Galaxy S3 tends to get really hot right below the sd card which might damage it a bit. I don't think they put it in a good spot but that has nothing to do with the card itself so just get it if you want a nice sd card.,
"As reviewed by the wife This is the perfect thing for a new mommy who loves to read books! As soon as I had my baby girl, I had to stop reading my novels because I had to give the baby my full attention. But how much time do I spend laying in bed, on my side, with the baby while she feeds Especially prior to 4 months when feeding took as long as 45 minutes! Not to mention cluster feeds during growth spurts! A book was out of the question because it's sooo tiring to hold up in side-lying-breastfeeding-position. My new Kindle was the solution! It's light, easy to disinfect (I use baby wipes on the case whenever I feel like it's not clean enough to go on the bed with the baby) and you don't need to keep a finger in the middle of the pages to keep it from closing - you know what I mean!And for some reason it's much easier to go through a book with a Kindle compared to an actual book. I never thought I'd be converted into the Kindle culture but here we are!",
Its just an SD card. works as good as any other. I don't know what else to say about it.,
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
"This review is from a normal working NON IT type of dude who likes to read books surf the web etc etc etc So this will review will be just like me telling you how I think the HDX is over a beer :) My family has 2 Kindles 1 HD which my son loves, 1 HDX mine, 1 ipad mini older son 1 ipad normal size for the wifey and I have used all of them at one time or another.1. Size weight,,,,, lighter and thinner than the ipad mini,,, perfect size to handle. I like the location of the on/off button and volume, much better than my sons HD I dont like to search for buttons on the side.2. Speed, its seems REALLY fast, book pages are in a blink of an eye the web loaded fast not choppy or drag, my wifi is pretty good so it helps. I have not tried the 4 G yet so I cant comment on that.3. Screen WOW its really sharp almost as good as my Samsung 55 in LCD 1080,,,,yes darling it is that sharp.4. Did I mention there is no blue or purple gold green or rainbow light around the border if there is it is so light I cant notice it. I only used it for an hour or so last night so I will update if this changes but for now it looked clean.5. Apps,,,hmm I hear a lot of people b*tching about google this or google that,,,,WHO CARES,,there is enough content on Amazon to keep me happy not that I am a betting man I will bet there is a bunch more in the pipe line.6. I maxed the Kindle out with 64 gb so I assume i will have enough room for years to come.7. Very easy to use,,,,,turned it on entered my wifi password and bam my account was set up in less than 1 minute.8. Shipping it was here in 1 day for 3.99 how can you beat that 9. Amazon eco-system good stuff period I have always been a huge fan 10. Did I mention there is no blue or purple border light :)11. So to sum up my thoughts on my new Kindle HDX is this,, OUTSTANDING I would recommend buying it over an I PAD for PRICE (value) the I PAD mini does not offer a 64 gb model and the 16 gb 4g mini cost 429 which is 5 bucks more than I paid for my maxed out Kindle AND the 64 gb 4g I PAD air is 829 Yea thats right 829 LOOKS the Kindle is a really sharp looking device, speed fast fast fast, screen WOW, sound clear rich amazon prime works for me, I hate shopping in stores love my books and amazon has it all.So your prob saying wow this is a normal dude posting a review that says this thing is pretty much perfect, well it does seem this way BUT,,,,,,,,,yea there is always a BUT, the only thing i see that should be included is a back facing camera not that I am one of those parents you see waving their IPAD around at a school play or my kids basketball game but sometimes your 5 year old does something so cute while your reading a book you just want to snap the pic, this is so minor that I really dont care but just putting it out there for Amazon ( cough cough ) .Did I mention I did NOT have a blue or purple light around the border Thanks for letting me post my 2 cents on this wonderful device Merry Christmas to all )ps what is the best screen covers case to get On a side note I returned the Kindle it to small for me and I had to drop it down to a 2 stars for being hung up on by customer service twice and the really bad screen flicker",
"I never thought I could have a 64 GB memory like this one, this is awesome; especially when you have a tablet. I'm using it on a Asus TF300T and it's working flawless. A piece of advise, since current tablets are not supposed to handle these, leave the format as exFAT, do not format it to FAT32 or NTFS.",
Very easy to install and works in my Samsung Galaxy Pro 10.1 from the get go.great way to add storage.,
Works great for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.  Just plugged and played.  Didn't have to do anything special.  I would recommend.,
This card failed after 2 weeks of use.  I have the same problem with their SSD failed on me after 6 months.,
"Works great in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Fast and reliable, what more could you want from a data storage device.",
Slower than expected transfer rates when used with phones and tablets...I had expected higher transfer rates given the data class,
"I haven't done any formal benchmarks, but the device seems pretty slow. I haven't seen any real performance boost vs. my old card even on bulk file copies. I have another 8GB samsung card that may be a knockoff that performs noticeably better than this card.I'm using it anyway. I don't really have the time to return it or anything.",
Definitely enjoy using this at home. I was surprised at how intuitive it is and was able to answer any question in seconds. I mostly use it to play music through Amazon player. I know there's tons more it can do and can't wait to take advantage of all its capabilities.,
I have this baby in my samsung note2 and there is not much to say except it seems to be working without a flaw,
"Works great, another awesome Amazon purchase! I use it in my Samsung Galaxy S 3.",
"First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory. It would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage, go buy a computer.Display: One word, amazing. Maybe I am pushing it, but the screen is so clear. I own an iPhone 5 and my eyes prefer my kindle. I love reading on this machine and for the price, amazon did a good job with this one.Read more",

"I used this on my Android tablet (Pantech Element and my Galaxy S3 phone).  The S3 took it without an issue but the Pantech required me to format it as FAT32.... it wouldn't read it any other way....  you can search the internet for FAT32 formatter which will format the card as FAT32 using an external card reader within seconds.After doing that, I've been using it for a few weeks now with no problems.  Very nice.  Now... just waiting for the 128GB model.  :)",
"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more",

I've tried reformatting several times to no avail.  I didn't have any of these problems with my old 32gb class 4 sandisk card...  There are other people having this problem as well, seems hit or miss.  I can't recommend this card at this time for this reason.EDIT:  I've contacted SanDisk and they are RMAing the card.  I'll improve the rating if the new card corrects the problem.EDIT: Got the new card, problem still exists...EDIT: I've suffered with this card for a year now, the only problem is that I cannot take video without studders, so I figured maybe software updates would eventually fix the problem.  They have not.  I have used multiple different camera apps, and the problem still persists.",
Works great in the car as my music drive.  Holds the entire collection too.  The speed was key for me.,
This little guy adds a ton of extra space on my Samsung GS3 for all my music and more! Worth the money,
"SOOOO pleased with this little dude.  I actually bought 2 of these - a 32GB and a 16GB for 2 MEEPS that are Christmas gifts, which, BTW, is about the coolest little tablet for little kids as it does it all - books, movies, games, internet, etc - all parentally controlled via cloud!!!  The MEEP has adaquate memory to a degree like all other handheld devices, however, if you want to store a lot games/movies/books on the MEEP you need an extra memory card and this is THE card to buy.  This 32GB was bought to go into a MEEP for the 4 year old and I don't know if she needed a Class 10, but for the low price of this SanDisk, why not?  I highly recommend this little card and the MEEP it went in - both are absolutely worth every penny.",

"I bought this for my Android phone and it kept stating ""media scanning"" over and over, even when the device was on or not even restarted. I thought it was the phone and was so annoyed. Then did a search and found that several others got a duds from this same batch off amazon. So not only did I pay for this, now I have a useless 32gb card that refuses to hold music on my phone, or anywhere else. I loaded a 4gb card in the same device and it only scans media when restarted and does not lag at all. The phone can hold up to 32 gb too. If you don't believe me, go onto the Sandisk message boards and look. It's a dud. So disappointing.",
"Works perfectly in my new phone. Great price and it was delivered on time and in good shape. I've never had any trouble with SanDisk, so I'd recommend it to anyone.",
Omg I am so enjoying this. Sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn't require plugs or wires. Saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet Best Buy. Play it now everyday.,

"I needed some new SD cards for my new tablets. After researching I bought the SanDisk ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10. It is way better than the almost same price SanDisk Ultra without Class10!! The Ultra Class10 is lightning fast. you can see the difference when you copy large files, you will note that read and write procedures are much faster, whether you use it in camera, smart phone or tablet. The price is also ok. Only drawback I noted was that the recognized capacity is not 32GB but 29,71GB in my Asus Memo Pad. Other than that I am extremly pleased with this Micro SD.",
"I am a fairly voracious reader - 120+ books/year, almost all on Kindle. I have purchased every Kindle edition as soon as it was announced. The price doesn't bother me too much, as I figure with as much as I read, I make the money back by buying Kindle vs. hardcover books (since I mostly read new releases). This is the first Kindle that I sent back though.It's not that the Oasis isn't great - it is. The display is slightly crisper than previous Kindles. It's not that it isn't set up well - the buttons are placed well and easy to use, and the touch screen works fine. It's really just a matter of personal preference. I love to read while I have coffee in the morning and while I'm eating lunch at work, and because of that I love the origami case that the Voyage has. It's hard to read the Oasis hands-free, especially if you are used to the Voyage. Also, when reading while laying down, I switch hands unconsciously a couple of times a minute. I didn't realize this until I used the Oasis, because with the Oasis you have to flip the Kindle over, which may not seem like a big deal, but it definitely does not create a seamless reading experience.So if you like to read while eating or laying down then you are probably better off using the Voyage. If you want the best looking read, then the Oasis is great. And regardless, you are better off reading any Kindle than you are watching the garbage on TV!",

"Had I not purchased a Paperwhite first, I could easily settle on the HDX 7 as a reader as well as a color tablet. The size difference between the two is practically negligible as is the weight difference (the HDX7 is slightly larger and about 8 ounces heavier). I can hold the the HDX7 in my left hand quite comfortably--just not quite as comfortably as the Paperwhite. Moreover, the text of the Paperwhite seems to wear longer on older, tired eyes (especially after reading the hype on behalf of e-ink text) than that of the HDX--at least during extended stretches of continuous reading.Still, there are moments when my eyes crave color, images and videos beyond which the Paperwhite can deliver. The television set, cable, and ROKU box are my wife's, and I'm no longer doing as well by watching movies or concerts on the severely restricted real estate of an iPod screen--all of which doubles the attraction of a tablet like the HDX. It offers the freedom and privacy of an iPod but with video footage that offers a welcome size-advantage compared to the iPod screen.For traveling purposes, I'm good with the Paperwhite and an iPod--both pocket-sized and answering to my reading, listening and occasional viewing needs. The speakers of the HDX may be stereo but they're far from full-frequencied, perhaps only slightly better than those of a new iPod Touch. So I'd recommend earphones when using either an iPod or the HDX as a music player--or, if your partner won't complain, a good adjunct speaker (with a supple, light cable for better sound and more reliable connectivty than dicey Bluetooth technology offers).I frankly can't see an iPod or tablet performing the many functions of a computer or a camera (I'm one of the ever more conspicuous minority who still carry a dedicated point and shoot camera). But the price point of the HDX makes it an affordable luxury device for dedicating to specific and occasional uses. I've met people who no longer use any sort of computer, doing all of their Facebooking, e-mail and banking with a mere tablet (usually an Apple iPad or Mini). My sense is that the HDX would prove slightly more cumbersome for such purposes--Apple's tablet has the refined processor, continually upgraded OS, and widely established ecosystem to make it a better bet for most users thinking of ditching their laptops. Aside from the added cost of the Apple tablet (twice as much as the HDX), I'm simply not excited about tablets in general. The affordability of the HDX, which has now got several years of refinement behind it, makes it the preferred choice in my case.In conclusion, I've got to rate the Paperwhite 1 for my particular uses as well as for Amazon's scoring a game-changing consumer technology coup second only to the release of the first Apple iPod in 2002 and the Macbook Air in 2008 (though it was not accepted by the general public until Apple's decision to ignore the naysayers and release it again in 2010). Not only is the Paperwhite small, versatile, fast-loading, and beautifully back-lit (no more fumbling around and experimenting with various clip-on lights), but there's no subscription charge for long-distance connectivity to Amazon. And I find it reassuring that Amazon includes an official, no-charge, on-line User's Manual, for printing out on a Mac computer. With the HDX, on the other hand, there appears to be no single authoritative and free User's Guide. Instead, your choices for instructions are unlimited--and I would advise against proceeding intuitively, especially if you plan to make use of Amazon's uniquely integrated film commentary, thanks largely to Bezos heady and timely purchase of the popular IMDB reference source. It may be no drone, but in all other respects it stands alone.",
"Used with my GoPro Hero 3 black edition and it works like a charm! It comes with the adaptor to use in a regular SD card slot, or can be read with any microSD card reader with no issues.  Pushing video, even high quality, high frame rate video to this card is flawless.",
"For the first two months, the card worked great in my GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition.  Then, one night, it randomly stopped working.  Amazon won't take it back, and I've got an email into SanDisk to see if I can get it replaced.  Now I'm out $52 and now can't use my camera.  Thanks so little.",
"Great price for a great chip, it worked perfectly in my new smart phone.  I swapped out a 4 Gig chip with this one, and now I have lots of excess storage capacity.",
"The description is quite confusing - it says at same time class 10, which means that you should not expect write speed higher than 10mb/sec, and at the same time, it says UHS-1, which means 30mb/sec write speed. The truth, as usually, is somewhere in the middle, but close to lower end. I have a dedicated, high speed PCI-E cardreader, which I use for chip benchmarking. So, this card showed 12mb/sec sequental write speed and 34mb/sec sequental read speed. So, UHS-1 is ""true"" only for read operations, meaning that if you wanted this card to speed-up your digital camera speed photography - you've made the wrong choice. Just for reference, this cardTranscend 16 GB Class 10 microSDHC Flash Memory Card TS16GUSDHC10has sequental write speed of 17mb/sec and sequental read speed of 24mb/sec. As you see, the cheaper transcend has average 40% faster write speeds!",

Purchased this for my phone.  It was easy to install and format for my phone.  It arrived on time and packaging was appropriate.,
"Perfect for my 4 year old son, he is so rough on things and this protects his kindle well.",
Bought this for my wife to be able to record tv programs on her phone so she can hand it over to the baby while in the car and starts to get fussy.  This thing holds a lot.  The phone takes a little longer to start up since it has to open up all her media but not by much.  Great!,
"I have loved and used my Kindle Keyboard for years now but I missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark. I purchased a Kindle Fire and I also use an iPad 3 but for ease of reading on my eyes I prefer the Kindle Keyboard. I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this new generation was released before I spent my money. I got this because I wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and I just love this new tablet. It offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text.I have added a video of the Kindle Paperwhite compared to a Kindle Keyboard and a Kindle Fire. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I will try to answer them.I love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear. I use the Kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books. Reading was my number one hobby my entire life and I just loved it. The Kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen I can enjoy my reading in every type of environment. I laid my Kindle Keyboard and the New Kindle Paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new Paperwhite. The new lighting system and screen clarity is where this Paperwhite design really is outstanding. With better contrast, lighting and custom designed fonts, the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e-Reader before. With 221 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) this screen provides a 768 by 1024 pixel screen that just makes the old Kindle Keyboard look old fashioned. Technology certainly does move quickly on.Read more",
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
Good for the price and so far it is working just fine on my phone.  Finally I can now save pics taken from the camera and things I download.,
Took awhile to get connected to my home wifi but now that it is it streams flawlessly with no lags in music. Doesn't have the dynamic sound range as other Bluetooth speakers i own.,

"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",

"Not a good typer or speller :) here is what I didSince I could not format it on my Pc Running WIndows 8 Pro or any of my cellphones running Android versions of 2.3.1 from Republic Wireless :).On my Canon Vixia HF M41 dual card Camrcorder I formated the card but the thing is, it still read as exFATso I mounted it onto my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 anyway and it said something about corrupt files or what ever and it asked If I wanted to format and I press ok and yeap it works now It reads about  54 gigs and some. Got this 64 gig  baby for $19.89 from Amazon Warehouse deals. I bought two but they cancelled one for no stock but it was still showing stock, oh well all I really needed was one I just got greedy.",
"They wanted $99 for a 64GB micro SD at best buy.  I've put movies, music, SQL Server databases, and files on this card and everything is working great!",
Great sound. Love it. It's value is well worth it.,
great price and just what i needed i would recomend this product i think all scan disk products are good,
It worked well for me in my tablet as extra memory. I would buy again when I need more memory,
"If you have one of the latest smartphones, go for this. I highly recommend this to take full advantage of the processing speed and fast computation need of our gadgets. Sandisk products are known for their quality and reliability. Of the couple of name brand flash products I use Sandisk gave me good ROI. Anything below will rob you of reliability.",
"Sandisk has made great memory products for a very long time. This is no exception. I bought this to expand the memory of a tablet I bought for my fianc&eacute;e, and it works well. I made sure to buy Class 10 because i want the fastest interaction between the device and the storage. Nothing ruins a user experience like waiting for storage to access and being read from, or written to.",
"Update on Dec 23 2013 - Please scroll to the very end of this review for 2 month use update. ...For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model. The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080). This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution. The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.Read more",

Works great in my new S5 I love this things. Now I just need to work my phone better so I can use the 32gb more. Over all works great,
Balance of trusting the name on the brand & price. Felt like the price I paid was a good value.,
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
We bought this for our new camera when we were expecting our first child. We use the camera about once per week (the iphone is just easier and usually takes a better picture for some reason) and we transfer the photos to our PC. It has worked well and we have no complaints so far (7 months).,
"this is the minimum speed class you want for video recording. there are faster ones, but this does the job and the value is good. make sure to check and see if the camera you are putting this in can take a card of this capacity. seems odd but some don't use a card of more than 32GB, so check first. also check web sites for firmware updates. many cameras did not take these at first but do now. what more can you say about a commodity like memory, get it and store stuff like crazy. to be fair at 1080p this will hold an insane amount of video and images, more than you are likely to shoot on a 2 week trip, but you can always use the extra space as storage and maybe this format will work in your new 4k camera; you will need 65GB then for sure...",
"I am sooo impressed with Amazon Fire TV. Believe it or not, I sit and watch the screensaver lots a lot because the pictures are just that good. It is like taking a trip around the world. The amount of things you can do with this Fire TV is pretty incredible to me. There is so much on here and that can be added as apps is impressive. There is a massive amount of things to watch, both free with Prime and much that is a fee to rent or buy. I am glad I made this purchase. This unit is so small I will take it with me on vacation and just plug it in to any TV with the HDMI and keep up with my favorite shows.",
"I tested it in several UHS-1 compliant devices and found the write speed at 11-12 MByte/Second. Sounds fine for a class 10 card but this is not what I was paying for. I don't expect it to run anywhere close to UHS-1 interface speed (104 MB/S) but it should be close to 30 MB/S as the manufacturer advertised. I have a lot more choices if I am only looking for a class 10 card.Indeed, microSD cards are usually slower than full-size SD card. They use the same Flash controller so the reason is really microSD cards use slower NAND Flash. Manufacturers know you are not going to use microSD cards in high-speed SLRs so they get to sell you lower quality NAND at a premium. My advice to you the photography enthusiasts is to buy full-size SD cards rather than microSD cards with adaptors.That said, the compatibility is great. It works great with my tablets, PCs, GPSs and phones. That is what I like about SanDisk. They do thorough compatibility tests before product release.",
Perfect and fast. This microsdxc is just what I need for my surface tablet. Just plug and play operation with no issues.,
Buy it. I could never commit to paying so much for data until my 32GB filled up so quick. So i wasted money buying the 32GB when in the end i still ended up buying the 64gb.,
Amazon is the real deal. Easy to install and use. I'm not into the mainstream TV programming so I like to ability to choose what I want to watch and when. It has the other similar brands beat hands down.,
Use this in my Windows 8 tablet. Works well and I can get close to the published throughput of 30MB/s.,
I have this in a Samsung GN 10.1 2014 Edition Tablet and getting 28Mbps transfer from my Canon T3i using a Eye Fi Mobi 8GB SD Card.,
"SanDisk Ultra Class 10 micro SDHC card (16GB, 32GB, and 64GB)I purchased the 32GB card for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and the 16GB card for another video recording device. I formatted both cards in FAT32 using Windows 7, and functioned without drama in the respective devices. I purchased the 64GB for my GoPro Hero3 Silver edition.The reason I chose the SanDisk Ultra is for the Class 10 speed rating, as well as the waterproof, shockproof, vibration proof, and X-ray proof durability. I had the 32GB Sandisk fail after 2 months of easy usage in my Samsung Galaxy S3. I don't abuse my phone and it is not subject to extreme temperature/vibrations. Sandisk replaced it under warranty but it was quite a hassle to do this.The 16GB card however, has been subject to extreme temperatures for well over 4 months: from -5F to 100F and that doesn't include solar loading from sitting under the sun, as well as 100% humidity! The 16GB card was dripping with water after I experienced water intrusion in one of my cameras, and it had been soaked in water (while operating) for several months.The packaging was easy to open by simply cutting across the top. However, finagling out the blister pack took some patience. The Frustration Free packaging is essentially a cardboard envelope sleeve with a plastic holder and the SD card adapter with microSD card inside. This is how it is shipped!Overall: 4/5 stars. Very affordable and decently fast micro SD cards. These are perfect for smartphones or recording devices used in extreme environments. However, one of them failed within 2 months. The speeds are also inconsistent. I posted a benchmark photo on Amazon showing my speeds with all 3 sizes of cards and the 32GB was the fastest.UPDATE 28 OCT 2012My 32GB card has failed after just over 2 months of use in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. It started dismounting/remounting intermittently by itself over night. I woke up this morning to find that the card is not readable via the phone and wouldn't work on my PC. The phone has not been abused and was not used in an extreme environment. This card was replaced under warranty by Sandisk.",
"Bought for my husband for Christmas and I have to admit that I use it much more than he does, I love this product even though it has been updated with newer versions. I like to have something with just books. Easy to use, screen is easy to read, battery life long. I use it at the beach and for travel. Nice to have",
"As others have found, these cards do not last. Mine died in less than 2 months. Lost several photos that I had not backed up yet. The warranty replacement died within 3 months.Go with another brand. I've been using a Kingston and so far, 9 months later, still working.",
Purchased two of these as they are the best. Yes there are faster SanDisk cards but this works just fine in the Note II .,
"Definitely, SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A) is working as advertised. I'm definitely happy about this product. The price was definitely worth it.",
"I bought this for memory storage in a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 to replace one that was unreliable just prior to leaving on vacation. It worked without problem. When I returned from vacation, I returned the defective one to Sandisk for a replacement and I now have two. It doesn't write as fast as my larger 32G SD card so I probably won't try to use it in an HD video camera.",
"Acquired this card a month ago for use in my phone Samsung Galaxy S4 and only have taken issues with it.The micro sd card is really bad, the camera takes a long time to be ready and repeatedly resets the phone. Absolutely not recommend it in my previous phone (S3) used a micro sd card 32GB Samsung brand and never had problems with it.To correct the problem of instability recommend formatting the card, I did and the problem remains the same.Live outside the U.S. and I must acquire excellent quality products because the cost of returning it exceeds the cost of the product.Next time buy a card SAMSUNG brand that never gave me problems.",
"No problems encountered and seems perfectly compatable with the S4...  Can't even tell when you are using something off the card or off the phones internal memory.Note that up to 32GB it requires the HC cards,  from there to 64GB it requires the XC version.Happy with this purchase so far.",
"Got this because you can't beat the price and Sandisk has so far always been reliable for me.  I own two 32gb UHS-1 cards and a few older (16gb, 8gb, class 4, class 6, etc) Sandisk MicroSDs not including my standard SDs or my USB thumb drives and they have stood up to my tests with only one card I can think of failing, which I was still able to recover all the data from (just not write to it anymore) and I'm pretty hard on my rewritable media.  What more can you say?",
This is about the same as what you would pay at Costco but you don't have to pay the sales tax. Same card lower price. Nice.,
"I hope you have better luck, it has gotten a lot of great reviews, but first the sticker(!) covering the contacts on the back fell off, then the card died completely. Hopefully it's an isolated incident, but I'm trying a different brand in case its a bad batch.",
The only drawback that I can assign to these SD cards is the limit of a 5 year warranty unlike Kingston.,
I love this product. It is easy to use and install.,
"What a DEAL............ I got this great tablet for a great price on Prime Day..... but was a little concerned it would be too big..to handle. but I was wrong.First I I was very surprised.. by several things about the Fire 10 that made me SMILE:......1) even though it is large in size the weight is LIGHT so it is much easier to handle than expected ( esp since my fire HD 8.9 HEAVY unit )).......2.) it does several things I wasn't expecting.. One is it has SCREEN MIRRORING... that means you can see your tablets screen on you great BIG TV screen. if you choose for games or what ever. 3. ) Smooth and FAST .. due to the nice processor.......4. ) WHOO HOO.. Google Play store can be easily added without disrupting you Amazon experience ( look it up on youtube))( it took less than 4 minutes and it was Up and RUNNING ))....... 5.) I think the Screen is Beautiful............ ( cannot imagine what others are seeing but this screen looks Great to me) 6.) FINALLY they put the speakers in the FRONT so it is much easier to hear you shows or music etc 7.) I think this is My FAV............I put in a great big 125g sd card and I am loaded to download anything I choose... loads of Movie from the A Amazon Prime Movies,..................ALL of my audio books from Audible.................and a huge amt of my Kindle Books...........I am delighted....... and should get several years out of this tablet in its present format..........ESP. now that google PLAY STORE is on it .Happy Happy Happy......",
"As soon as it was inserted into the Samsung Galaxy S4 it started getting filled up in a trip to NYC. It is great not having to empty photos and music off the phone, and the phone still works fast, which is good considering SD cards with apps tend to make Android phones slow. Great quality from SanDisk!",
"I have grown very accustomed to having Alexa around. There are new skills added on a very regular basis. I really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song/radio station/podcast to be played. I also enjoy having books read to me, since I'm not much of a reader. The setup was super simple, so simple that I wasn't sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I'm not sure I ""needed"" this item, but I can't imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase.",
"Once you cut and pry your way through Sandisk's packaging, you will be rewarded with a nicely-made and high-performing MicroSD UHS1 flash memory.  It comes formatted to SD.org's standards in FAT32, so it's ready to go for most applications.  My single gripe about this product is that they have omitted the usual small plastic box that holds the card and adapter.  I use those!  Since I frequently switch cards between uses, and frequently have them in storage, those little boxes are very useful.  It's way too easy to lose a MicroSD.Anyway, here are the results from ATTO disk benchmark:Settings (anticipating digicam use): Total length 64MB Overlapped I/O and QD=4 (but it never exceeds 1)Segment Size in Kbytes, Read/Write in Kbyte/secSize  Write  Read.5  9904  163431  14555  170332  13454  273244  14194  353378  15065  3985316  14154  4062932  14277  4295764  13212  44291128  17567  44247256  16209  44442512  15391  444421024  17408  444422048  16229  44442[Sorry for the ugly table, Amazon does not support consecutive spaces, including alt-255, or embedded tabs]This is very fast for a MicroSD.  It's not quite up to what Sandisk achieves in full size UHS1 SD cards that can write over twice this speed, but those are electronically more complex cards. The Micro form factor likely doesn't permit the additional hardware to achieve speeds comparable to the larger cards.  Note that the read speed is a lot faster than what Sandisk promises.  (Note also that you will NOT achieve these speeds with a USB2 reader.  You will need either a USB3 or built-in PCIe reader to get accurate results.  So do not complain to me if you use a USB2 reader and don't achieve these speeds.)In any event, you'd be hard-pressed to find anything faster.My personal experience with Sandisk products is very good.  That is, I've never had anything fail on me.  Given the very reasonable prices of these, I rate them as Highly Recommended.",
"It is very fast and very, very practical! I really like, almost able to use, and in my phone can play full HD, only great!",
"i love this memory card, i use it with my galaxy s 2 smartphone and couldnt be happier, its very fast, when i take photos the phone doesnt stutter like it did with my old memory card, a definive must buy if your a power user and can afford it.",

"It is as advertised, is in my Tab at the moment and have it about 75% full with no problems!",
"This card has lots of room for everything. A Class 10 card for about $20, you can not go wrong.",
Bought this for use with a GoPro 3 black. It works as advertised and has plenty of room for photos and video. I have yet to fill this card up recording time-lapse for a period of 24 hours.,
"SANDISK makes great products, I always try to buy their name. This is for the Sony digital recorder I also bought.",
I use the phone with this card in combination with an Eye-Fi Mobi card  to back up photos when I'm in the field.,
"I have had this card for a couple of days and I am very pleased with it. I bought it for use in my Toshiba Thrive 7"" tablet, mainly for storing movies. I used it with the included adapter in my HP netbook (which is where my movies are stored) and it worked with no problem. The transfer of 4 movies took about 15 minutes altogether, and they all played perfectly when I put the card back into my Thrive. For this price and with Prime shipping, there was no way I could pass it up! I will probably be ordering more of these in the future.",
Very satisfied with the product and price.SanDisk has not let me down never and 32 Gb added to my Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet just rocks.I could have gone for the 64 Gb but I really don't need more than 32. And the price was right,

I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance.

"Without an on / off button, I have found that the controller comes on (the light comes on showing it's connected to the FireTV) even when not in use. I am assuming this is why the batteries were draining so quick. Now, I put the remote into a 2nd room when I am not using it and the batteries last a normal lifespan. The light never turns on know when the remote is in the other room.",
"It just works, what more is there to say.  These days every smart phone needs as much memory space as possible.",
"I bought a new underwater camera. So my 32 GB Adata went to the camera and this Sandisk went to my Galaxy Note 10.1.  On our family vacation I took the newly purchased camera and the 32 gb Adata.  Long story short:  A lot the photos and videos taken in Cancun are gone.  Photos and video from top of a Mayan ruin (pyramid), snorkeling, family photos are all corrupted and gone.  At first, I thought it was the camera until I placed the Sandisk in and experimented with it.  This Sandisk was flawless!  I will be staying away from lesser known brands and staying with Sandisk going forward.",
Piece of crap died two months after I bought itI am sure that makes it on me to buy anotherGREAT!,
Gives me more time and memory when I'm riding with Shiftn Steel Sport Riderz and want to get some great footage,
"either it works or it doesn't -- it works, it was a fair price and I am happy with it",
"I purchased this because my Samsumg Galaxy S3 was getting full of pictures. It installed easy, works great and I have had no speed issues when writing or reading from it,",
It has a good sound. The battery last long and it connects easily to WiFi and blue tooth. But you have to touch a button before you speak to it.,
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
Great outside speaker and alexa is really great to use.,
This is great. It gives me a lot of extra storage space for my phone. It just worked out of the box. Perfect.,
I got a few of these for tablets and phones and they have been fine. I loaded them with movies for a trip and they playback was perfect. I used one in a camera for video and it was plenty fast enough for the clips I was taking.,
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
Like a previous reviewer mentioned it is fabric over hard plastic it is not a snug or tight fit. Good quality though.,
"This case is overall quite nice, but has started to peel apart on the edges a little. I will try to update this review later on after I see how it holds up.The tablet automatically locks, and wakes the screen when closing and opening the case, which I think is the most appealing part about this case.",
"Using it in a cell phone, and so far no problemsI would recommend this o anyone who needs more memory",
I use this in my Hisense Sero 7 Pro and it works great. It's a good buy for any device,
"it is handy. 64gb is a good size. even though many devices claim only to support up to 32 gb card, many of them actually do support 64g card.i like sandisk, it is a brand you can always trust (not saying they dont have lemon,but it's happened to everything).",
"This is my first kindle since the 1st generation. That tablet went away after a couple years. Kindle Fire 7th gen is a great tablet for the money. Honestly, I don't use it for reading. I use it for browsing websites, social media, and listen to podcasts. I use my Bluetooth headphones to listen to the podcasts. The couple times I've used the speaker on the tablet, I haven't been disappointed, but I wasn't impressed. It works just fine for watching videos in bed. Had no problems hearing. Search Google for some tips and tricks to get apps from the google play store. Silk browser is terrible. I reccomend installing Opera. I reccomend this tablet for people like me, who want to just lay in bed or on the couch and doing simple tasks on the tablet. Don't need a 300 or 400 tablet to do what I'm doing.",
"Absolutely great product, will recommend. Great price. Used it on Note 10.1 and Note 2 phone. If you download a lot of music and movies, a must have.",
"It's very cheap, fast tranfers in the right device and the right USB port. I haven't tested static, etc resistant stuff. If anything happens, I'll update",
"Many devices cannot use this size of card, but works perfectly in my Samsung GS4. Plenty of additional space for whatever I need. No problems to date. Excellent!",
"I use this card in Smasung Galaxy S4 active and before that I used it in my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. It has always worked flawlessly and never given me a single problem. I use the card to copy movies to it. Playback is always smooth. I mostly play high definition movie rips. These require a lot of processing power and data transfer from the card. It has always done great. I will continue to buy this card. I have one in my MacBook Air for backups. Again, no problems.- Damon",
"This is a wonderful product.  May not hold my whole library, but close enough.  Works great with the Galaxy Note 10.1, just need to reformat it as FAT and you're good to go.",
"SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter, exactly what was expected and what was described.  Could not ask for anything more.",
"I bring it when hanging out outside, exercising, doing housework anywhere my echo won't hear me",
"it's very fast micro sd card i use it for my mobile and gopro camera , sandisk is the best ever",
Works as advertised for my Samsung GN2 Smartphone.  Got one for my dad's Samsung GS3 too.  Sandisk is simply the most reliable hi-cap micro SD flash memory out there.,
"This integrated perfectly with our fire tv stick, and was a great surprise for the gamers in the family. It works great with the fire stick, and does not negate the other remote, giving us two remote options. It even has a headphone jack, making it so my husband can watch tv shows with bad language while the kids are in the room. This is a great addition.",
This is a very nice addition to the alexa family pf products. It is wireless so you can move it around to house wherever you want to listen to music at without having to search for plugs. Great sound and portability.,
"I really want to like these and I do trust SanDisk more than other manufacturers of memory cards. That said, I'm moving on to my 3rd card. Thank you Amazon for having exceptional customer service, or else I'd be very upset.Basically this card will suddenly not allow writing to it anymore. You can't save files to it, you can't delete files from it and you can't event format it. I've tried doing all three in different OS'es and devices with no luck. Doing some reading on the SanDisk forums this seems to be happening a lot with these cards.I'm returning this to Amazon and trying my luck with a different brand to see what happens.",
I used this to record continuously and it worked great. I have read to not try to update with a card bigger than 32gb in the camera so I always revert back to a smaller card before connecting for updates.,
"If you like the Kindle Fire HD then you will love the Kindle Fire HDX. The new device runs three times faster, is lighter in weight, and the battery lasts slightly longer. The sound quality on this device is excellent and the display quality is absolutely stunning. Below are some of the features to expect from the Fire HDX. BUILD QUALITY---There is NO blue haze on the 8.9 HDX.---The build quality is excellent.---Auto contrast is good (not buggy).---Operating system is very intuitive except after downloading free prime videos to watch offline. If you remove the videos from your Carousel then, from the video menu, you must go to the left side bar, and click *downloads* to see your videos. PRIME DOWNLOAD ISSUES (free video download limitations)Prime members can download selected Prime Instant Videos to watch when not connected to the internet. There are major restrictions imposed on prime videos as listed below.---Not all Prime titles are available for download.---Most popular prime titles are NOT available for download.---There is a max of 25 titles that can be downloaded free at any one time.---Prime titles have a viewing period.---Viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the video, or 15-30 days (which ever comes first).---After the viewing period expires you need to reconnect to the internet.---Titles can be downloaded to only two separate devices at a time.---If you exceed the device quota then you must delete one of the titles before adding to another device.---There is no way to know which titles can be downloaded unless you have the HDX (amazon does not place a banner on the titles other than to say PRIME).Read more",
"Despite the Class 10 rating, this card has much slower write speeds than some others and there are numerous examples online of it not being fast enough to work with the high resolution video from the GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition. If you're using that camera, choose one of the cards recommended on their site.",
"It fits perfectly in the Surface RT, unfortunately the advertisement for the RT didn't say which memory device was supposed to go in it and a regular size card was originally bought and opened before we could figure that part out.  Nothing wrong with this product and it makes my 64GB Surface large enough to hold a whole term of school information.",
Comes with adaptor and case so it'll work well as a regular sd card or micro sd. Works great! Affordable price.,
I can't read or write anything on this card on my PC or my GS3. I am pretty sure that I got a dud.,
I bought this for my son's Samsung Galaxy MP3 player(an Android -Version 2.3 Gingerbread device) to replace a class 4 8GB. He was thrilled with the noticeable difference in performance in the device.,
"I put this in my mom's ASUS Transformer Book T100TA-C1-GR to provide an ample amount of storage for all pictures, music, and movies. This performs very well and we've experience 0 lag so far. Great product.",
This is a good alternative to the amazon echo. I like that supposedly it's not listening all the time and you have to hit the button to talk to Alexa but at the same time you have to hit the button to talk to Alexa.,
"The drawback is all the darned packaging for this tiny card. Seriously, it's plug in and you're done, why all the packaging?Aside from that, it's working.  I'd buy it again.",
It's the wrong one because I thought I was getting the 64 GB one.  I need to know  how to return this one and I will reorder the right one.,
I bought this one for my tablet... well it is very fast. durable and long lasting... I recommend this item...So get one now.,
Works great in my GoPro 3 Black. I will only buy SanDisk. If you want a name you can trust this is it.,
Purchased this for my Galaxy S3. Went from a 32 GiB internal to a total of 64 GiB of storage. The card hasn't presented any problems and seems pretty speedy. I use it for storing all my nandroid backups and ROM downloads.,
Still amazes me how small this hardware is with such a large amount of storage.  SanDisk is a leader in solid state memory.  I am happy with the reliability and speed of this product and would recommend it to anyone.p.s. The only issue I have with SanDisk is the normally high price; however I got this on sale so I am happy with what I paid.,
Works great with a Dell Venue 8 Pro.,
"While I got this card as a ""deal of the day"" on Amazon, I would gladly pay $79.99 for it!With that said, there has been some skepticism related to the serial number of the card as it is displayed on Amazon. I can confirm that I received a brand new 64 Gb card with the serial SDSDQUA-064G-U46A. The packaging of the card says that it is a Class 10 / UHS Speed Class 1. After formatting / copying over 20 Gb of data from my Evo 3D's previous card, I get write speeds of about 9 Mb/s and read speeds of about 20 Mb/s. I am fine with this, and can not complain because I don't believe the Evo 3D is intended to be compatible with SDXC cards, however it does work just fine.",
"You can't possibly go wrong with a San Disc product!  Although I purchased this for my son, I have used San Disc in the past and have never been disappointed!",
What can I say it is a sandisk (not a knock off) and it works great.  Never buy one that is faster than the max speed of your device or you will be throwing away money.  (or just call it future proofing it for your next device but who knows what we will be using then),
"According to the info, the Paperwhite charges faster with the charger made for a Kindle but I think any brand will work. It came in a package deal when I bought my Paperwhite otherwise I would've skipped it used what I've been using for my old Kindle. I gave it 4 stars, because I like it, but feel it's overpriced.",
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
I have owned these little card for about a year now. Works as intended. No signs of corruption or data loss. I usually always buy sandisk.,
I have bought several of these and find they do just what they are designed to hence 5 stars. I recommend this memory card for any electronic device that requires a micro SDHC card and from past experience find that SanDisk is a reputable name brand.,
I have used it with no problem on my tablet Galaxy Note 10.1 Sansun from day one and it works perfect. The cost was relatively low compared to other stores.,
I used this SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s to expand my Surface RT and it is really excellent.,
"This is the second SanDisk micro SD that I've had to return due to some sort of error.  I am thinking I just have bad luck and hopefully 3rd time is the charm.During the time it was working properly, it seemed to be quick.",
I purchased this to use with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1. I chose this memory card because I have used SanDisk products many time in the past and have never had a problem.,
Installed in my Blackberry Q10 SQN100-1 and formatted. Works just fine. Plenty of storage space for pictures and videos of my son at the park.,
Purchased based on the recommendation from a reviewer of a dash Camera also purchased here. No issues at all just works.,
Good write performance. It sped up the time to load my pictures as well. This was a good buy. There are lots of manufacturers for memory cards but I feel most confident with Sandisk.,
"I recently ordered my 8th Kindle. It was to replace my 7th Kindle which I unknowingly crushed. I love the Kindle Keyboard as my clumsy old hands tremble too much to type on a touch screen. For me, newer is just more frustrating. However, new Keyboard Kindles are scarce on the ground, so I got a reconditioned one. I noticed on my account page that Amazon recognized my new Kindle as soon as I bought it. When it arrived, however, it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home WiFi. So I called my internet provider. I waded through that companys automated menu beginning with press 1 for English. That irritates me as I think English should be the default language in this country. But pressing on, I provided my 9 digit phone number, my 10 digit account number, my 9 digit zip code, my address, my 8 digit birthday, and the name of my favorite pet, my first car and my oldest nephew. Then I listened to an automated menu that had a 9 item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem I was having. After all this, I was asked if I would provide feedback after the call. I know this company and I was sure I would have comments to make, so I pressed 1 for yes. Then instead of finally letting me speak to a person, the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers I had already provided. Patiently I retyped all I had already typed. This time I was cannier. I refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection. Didnt I press 1 for English After struggling for several minutes I begged for a supervisor as I could not understand the English spoken by this person. I was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person I spoke to did not handle my problem. I asked for phone numbers every time so I could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally. Finally I found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my Kindle and my WiFi. I again asked for a telephone number in case I had further problems. Im sorry. I do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me. Well, I should have known. I had been on the phone for 50 minutes.Then my Kindle would not download my archived items. So I contacted Amazons Help Line. I got an American in the first minute. I did not have to press anything I explained my problem. The Amazon American fiddled with a few buttons on his end and my Kindle began working correctly. I was on the phone for 4 minutes.",
I cannot gauge if its better or faster than a class 4 or 6. I use it in my mobile and it saves pictures just as quickly. Dont see a difference. But it has advertised capacity and works ok.,
"This was pretty awesome and cheap, I had just bought my Galaxy S4 and figured I'd upgrade my sd card from the 32 I had, its nice to have since the s4 inexplicably has almost no internal storage, still awesome phone though, but we're not talking about that today.",
Fast and reliable. So far no problems in my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone. Plus I got it on sale and well worth price.,
"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysJuly 30, 2014Hi Dallas, thank you for sharing your feedback. We wanted to let you know that we made it easier to find your favorite Prime content with the click of your remote. You can now browse many more Prime-only categories, including Top Prime TV, Top Prime Movies, Prime TV for Kids, Prime Movies for Kids, Prime TV by Genre, and Prime Movies by Genre.",
"My Windows Tablet came with a 32 GB Storage space allocation.  This allowed me to add the extra space I needed for applications, and media to let me use the tablet the way I wanted, and not be limited to the available storage space of the C drive.",
"All I can say is that if you need a new SD card, dodn't hesitate to buy this one.  Great deal and it works perfectly.",
"I bought two of these for my samsung Galaxy note 10.1.  Just to be on the safe side...I put them in my note FIRST and formatted them, then took them out and put media on them.  I use the media card reader with these and it works just fine on my computer and tablet.",
"I like it comes in handy fits good with my Galaxy S5 smartphone, no problem with filing data on a computer.",
The card was fast enough for HD video recording with my Sony ActionCam as-15 and it is very durable. Great stuff,
"This is a great device if you don't have a smart TV (apparently mine streams Amazon Prime, but the interface is so terrible that I never bothered using it) or other streaming device besides the Chromecast (which is very limited).First of all, little things: the packaging was very nice. The remote itself feels amazing to hold and the buttons are very simple. The Fire TV itself is beautiful, very minimalist. All you see is the tiny LED on the front when it's in use.The voice search IS great It didn't catch Idina Menzel, but it could be because I searched her name right after searching John Travolta. It brought up musicals, Will Ferrell, etc. without a problem. Voice search only works within everything available on Prime it seems (things available to rent or stream), and I wish it included the Netflix titles, perhaps with a See on Netflix button instead of just showing me the rent option for what isn't on instant Prime.I wish you could sort by Amazon Prime-only movies, with an interface similar to Netflix's. I want to see what's available to me NOW, not what I can rent.The games are fun, and it's pretty cool to be able to play phone games on the TV. My whole family actually enjoyed playing Minion Rush. I don't have any controllers yet, and I hope that 2P games, if they aren't out yet, are coming in the future.I've only had mine a day, but so far I'm loving this purchase We do have an xbox one, smart tv, and even a computer hooked up downstairs into the same 60 monitor, but the xbone interface for netflix is SO AWFUL that we hardly ever use it (unlike the one on the 360) and it's a pain just to have to start up the computer and interact with such a huge screen with computer peripherals. Because our Vizio smarttv is rather clunky and slow, it has never loaded any video streaming for us before somehow crashing. This Fire TV clears those problems, and with an INCREDIBLY simple interface.Love it I would give this 5 stars if you could use the voice search for commands and inside apps (such as Netflix).EDIT April 11, 2014:After using my Fire TV for about a week, I've settled into what I use it for most (until I get my gaming controller, which is apparently on backorder until the 23rd). I mostly wanted a device to watch my favorite shows (via Netflix or locally) without any troubles. It's MUCH faster to launch and use the Netflix app on the Fire TV than it is on my smart TV, the xbox one, and the computer hooked up to it via HDMI. It's also PERFECT for streaming locally via Plex -- my music, TV shows, movies, and more are so very easily accessible on here vs. the computer hooked up (which is not my PC) and the xbox one (which is such a nightmare for this task that I barely consider it). This app is only 99 cents and will make your Fire TV experience a lot more enjoyable, so you really owe it to yourself to get it.I absolutely love the feel of the remote and how simple and intuitive it is to use. After fiddling with the TV remote for the input button, which despite always being in the same spot, I always have trouble finding, it's a joy to use a remote that is much simpler. This probably makes me sound old (I'm 20). The remote orientation doesn't matter, so you don't fiddle around with making sure you've pointed it correctly. I suppose this is because it uses BT.The voice search, which I use somewhat often, is a joy to use. It's much better than shouting across the room at the Kinect, which only picks up what I say less than half of the time. I hope Microsoft doesn't save voice recordings the same way Amazon does, because about 80 of that is just me yelling profanities at the Kinect.",
"My original two cards were manufactured in 2012 and over time started affecting the functionality of our phones.  Some internet research resulted in reading another review on Amazon with similar problems and discussed to contact SanDisk support for replacements due to a known silicon bug.  The new cards arrived in about a week and we returned the old cards with the defects.  Only hassle was was trying to read the serial and date codes off of the car, but a phone with 4X zoom made it possible.  SanDisk customer support was easy to work with and the products (new and old) are fast and worked great.",
"They are scandisk micro SD, they work well and I have never had a problem with this product brand. short a couple words, sorry",
"I was an early adoptor of the Amazon Echo, when I heard they were releasing a mobile version I wanted it. It wasn't until we spent a lot of time cleaning our old home before moving that we realized how usefule this lil guy was, just set it up to your phones wifi hotspot and you have a fully function Echo. I would buy this again if I didn't already have one.",

i got to say that love it!! makes it easier to play music without pairing any device to it and perfect sound for my needs.,
"I've only had my Echo Show just a little over 24 hours now, so please take that into consideration. I currently own the original echo which is in my living room, a dot in my bedroom, and one at work. I have lights, fans, a thermostat, surround sound, and tv all connected to my Alexa devices. Of course I had to buy one with a screen.Initially I wanted to put my show on a 70 inch TV stand by my 60 inch TV. I don't have end tables and quickly came to the realization that a viewing a 7 inch screen from 8 feet away wasn't going to work for me. My Show now sits on my kitchen counter. I figured I'd get more use out of it in my living room because I generally spend more time in their than the kitchen.The problem with displaying the show on a kichen counter is that the screen can only be seen from straight on, so if you aren't standing directly in front of it, it's hard to view the screen. You will have to turn it in a dirction that it would be facing you.As far as I can tell you can not cut the screen off completely, which would make this a bad fit for a bedroom. The clock displays in white with the screen in a dim black by using the command turn off the screen.This device was marketed as a hands free companion in the kitchen for things like recipes. My frustration is when I ask it to pull up a recipe it's inconsistent. Sometimes it wants to send the recipe to my phone, sometimes it wants me to swipe down on the screen to access the cooking directions and ingredients. Why can't I just say Alexa scroll down Why do I have to touch the screen Why does it have to send the recipe to my phone for me to view it when the Show already has a screenI was hoping for more video footage with my daily briefings, but it is very limited.Read more",
For the price it's a very good deal. I have lots of space and it works perfect in my cell phone.,
"This cards holds everything I can think to out on it. I have barely filled it up. It works fast, there is no lag when accessing it. The card let's you take HD video straight onto it.",
This works with my Galaxy Note 2. The phone recognizes it and it reads 59.47gb available. Very sturdy card fits perfectly comes with the adapter. Once you place it in your device it is best to format the card so the device can read it. You also want the class 10 rating.,
San disk has always been a good brand for me.  It worked very well for my samsung galaxy phones and tablets.,
"I bought this for use in my new GoPro Hero3 black and it works great. I like the fact that it comes with an adapter, though I really wish that we'd move to USB adapters as the standard ""accessory"". Highly recommend.",
"Plenty of room for all my photos, music and random documents I decide to load onto my phone. It works great with my HTC One M8 and apps stored on the SD card run as smooth as they did on the phone itself. File writes were as fast as I expected from an XC I card.The only downside, and this is minor, is the MicroSD adapter it comes with seems a little cheap. But hey, that's not the reason I bought this card.",
I have 2 of these ScanDisk Ultra 32Gb class 10 microSDHC cards.  One for my Acer Iconia A100 Android tablet and one for my Linux laptop to move files around.  I've formatted both differently to make them fit best for their hosting operating system and both are working great.  No issues and great performance.I can stream 1080p movies from these cards without hiccups.I also used one of these cards in my 1080p camera and had no issue whatsoever keeping up with writing speed.Great card.,
"have had no problems with it, access times are actually a bit slower then in phone memory. but read is pretty good.",
Great micro sd card! very helpful to store my media files and has no problem for my Samsung Galaxy note2!!,
"I was looking for a simple, reliable and fast micro SD chip which I could use with both my new chromebook and my galaxy s3. This product does exactly that. Movies won't lag and with the adapter you can easily use it for laptop and cell devices. Great buy!",
"It has worked fine, so I have no complaints.  I've purchased SanDisk products several times and have been happy with this brand.",
Price was great on Amazon and now even better.  Have the chip in my phone and it appears to work great.....fast and so far no errors have been encountered.,
"I was in need this item and couldn't find it at local store.  Impressed me after i received it, it worked like a champ and able to store so many things in this card.",
"Bought two, one for me and one for my husband.  Works great.  Feels good to have a lot of space on my smart phone to save pictures, movies taken, etc.",
"Works great but wants you to buy subscription to get some music you may like, just found out it supports dish network",
"You can't go wrong with Sandisk and you can't go wrong with Maximum space!I love movies, so space is important.",
"These are excellent SD cards for phones, cameras or whatever else you have that takes a micro SD card. They work perfect with the adapter too!",
"I needed a place to shove all my music videos for party portability. The write speeds are around 10-12MB a second, so it's no barn burner, but read speeds are good enough to playback 1080p content, and that's what really counts to me.",
This item works great as expected without any issues. I would recommend this item for anyone in need. Good buy.,
"Speakers has an excellent quality, despite the small size.The only disadvantage is the Amazon Echo feature, not present in this one, which you can just ""call"" Alexa and she will answer you. In this one, as the name says, you need to ""tap"" the button to wake Alexa up.",
"While the class 10 speed is excellent (it's amazing when files will initially transfer at 200MB/s before settling down to ~19), you do need to use a reader with proper SDXC support, and manually format the card in a good partitioning program, like minitools or easeus. That alone should disqualify it from 5 stars, for lack of user-friendliness. But if it weren't for that, the fast, roomy card is a wonder to own.",
I use it for a tablet. I can only say it works with my tablet and it doesn't break. No more remarks.,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
upgraded from a class4  to this can feel the difference on both a S2 and S3. Fast read and write speed really help when downloading large files as well from the internet with speed.,
"I purchased this card to be inserted into my new Blackberry Z10 smartphone. at first the card wasn't recognized, but after formatting from exFat to NTFS (I know, I know, the warnings told me that hell would open up and eat me if I did this, but im not scared at all) it worked flawlessly.  would buy (and reformat) again",
The card works great. Re-formatted in the phone and copied all data to it and re-installed. Works fast and works well.,
in my Samsung note 2. fast no delays. transfers data in fon and to pc immediately. Good value for a top rated card.,
"Not much more to say, I've tried many and these are the very best (speed, price, reliability, compatibility.)  I highly recommend these cards.",
Not much to say here other than it works fine.  I use it in the SD RAM slot in my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. No performance issues and will provide more than enough extra storage for a tablet.,
"I've had this memory card for about 4 days. I ordered it with my new Galaxy S4 Verizon. Worked perfectly out of the box, didn't have to format, and read & write speeds meets up to my expectations. I will still keep my eyes on this card for little longer because I see some reviews reporting that cards fail after some time, but seems to be ok for me.Not relevant to this product, but I did get ONTRAC shipping(Amazon prime 2 day shipping) for this memory card and my Galaxy S4. After reading SO many negative reviews and feedback about this shipping company, I was crossing my fingers and hoping that they wouldn't do something stupid to my package. Fortunately, I got my package on time and nothing was damaged. One minor complain is that ONTRAC does not update their tracking history very often, or at all(based on my other purchases). As I was phoneless for couple days and really needed a phone, I checked the tracking history probably once every couple hours. It was showing that it has left the faculty for 2 1/2 days and was not updated at all until about an hour before I got my package saying that it went out for delivery on 9AM (I received my package around 5PM). Again, I got my package on time with no problem so I'm ok, but with the history of ONTRAC being so rubbish it just made me worry because I didn't wanted to be phoneless for 2-3 weeks.",
"I have been amazed at memory pricing, but this little card is inexpensive, fast and just what I needed for my new tablet.",
"I have owned a Kindle for several years now. I have had the 2nd generation Kindle and I have had the Kindle Keyboard. When my mom expressed interest in getting a Kindle I decided to give her my Kindle Keyboard because she doesnt have Wifi in her house and my older Kindle Keyboard had 3G, which is what she needed. And I decided to buy the Basic Kindle for myself because (1) I didnt want to wait for the Paperwhite to come out and (2) I just needed Wifi and (3)and most importantly I JUST WANT TO READ A BOOK, not listen to text-to-speach, or go shopping on Amazon, or listen to music, etc. All I want to do is read a book...thats it! This Kindle is perfect for that. Its smaller and lighter, the pages turn faster than the Keyboard version, it basically has everything I need to download a book and read a book with a much better price than the Paperwhite or Keyboard. Yes, you have to navigate through the keyboard on this kindle with a 5-way controller, but I rarely use the keyboard anyway. To download a book, I just search and buy books on my computer and send them to my Kindle...which is much quicker no matter what version of Kindle you have. So if you dont need, want, or use all the extras then I would definitely recommend the Basic Kindle for 69 with special offers, because who really pays attention to the screen savers anyway.",
I have come to trust the SanDisk brand for file storage and was not disappointed with this card.  It has held up to months of constant file writing and re-writing with use in a dash cam that loop records.  I recommend this card to anyone.,
"bought as a gift for my daughter. actually sounds better and easier to set up than expected. the personal assistant feature is really amazing, instant response to requests for information and music.",
Reasonably priced and worth every penny! I love it.,
dont even bother to try - will not show up in finder and will not show up if placed on any reader,
"After using an 8 Gig microsd in my galaxy s3 for a year, I knew I needed a new sd card when I got the s4. This sd card has worked out really well for me. I am no longer worried about running out of space when I take pictures on my new s4.",
I have been using it for over a year now in my galaxy S3 and it seems fast and reliable.  Do we really know how good they are until it goes out or crashes?,
"A great chip and works fine in my camera and a tablet if you are just streaming music from it, but if you are putting this in in something high demand like a Raspberry PI or CuBox-i the higher speed chips are better.",
"I have owned many an SD card in the past, and this is probably the best bang for the buck I've ever received in a card.  I'm not super nitpicky about data read/write speeds necessarily, but this card is plenty fast for me in my Samsung Galaxy Note II.  Pick one up while they are on sale!",
"We have been using Echo since April 2015. Prior to that time, my husband had been hospitalized for several weeks. He is currently wheelchair bound. We immediately installed the Hue bridge and lights as well as the WEMO outlet. With these, and dear, dear, Alexa, he has a great deal of control of his environment in ways that make him much more independent. Others might enjoy Echo for fun and convenience, but for him it is a lifeline! He has even had her turn the lights on in my bedroom when I didn't hear him call.We use the shopping list feature a lot, and my husband has added things to the list that he remembered, while I was already at the store. Should I mention he adds things like chocolate bars when I'm not looking No more paper lists! I just look at the app on my phone and things disappear as I check them off.We transport Echo from the living room to the bedroom, since it is easier for him not to have to use the remote, plus it is always there for his favorite music, an update on news, and to check the weather. Or, when he needs cheering up, I ask for a joke. Tosave plugging in behind his lift chairs, I have ordered a second plug. I love the easy reconnect to the WIFI.I was a bit worried at first about his word slurring with his Parkinson's, but it has worked the opposite way! I notice he focuses his words much better while giving commands. After he forgot her name early on, we added it so he could remember using the Zink hAppy App.My granddaughter was happy to check her math problems using Echo, and in addition to the music stations and Amazon play lists, Echo is a breeze to use as a Bluetooth device. I have used it to play my meditation apps and iTunes music.Read more",
I got a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 2 and I got this to increase memory. I had hoped to transfer files from my MacBook but it will not recognize the memory card. I need to go to the Apple Genius bar to see if they can figure it out.,

"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more",
"Great product, great price, great quality!  I've purchased 6 of these so far for family and friends.The only thing better than this would be a 128gb model!I only wished that laptops came with micro SD slots!",
"Card has failed several times in the phone I installed it in. I purchased it for the phone where it has resided for a month. In that time, it has required reformatting three times which makes its utility useless as a storage device.",
"I love everything about this case except for how it fits on the Echo Dot. I was expecting a snug fit however, it is very lose and so you have to make sure that if you pick it up to move it (and the power cable is disconnected), the dot will fall out of the case.",
What can I say? It's a micro SD card I use for a SanDisk Sansa Clip+. It has worked perfectly with no errors.,
Ordered this to go with the tablet I ordered for my fiance. It works well and she loves her tablet!,
"Good price, good quality. Put it in my phone for some extra storage, and it's held up very well since I got it.",
"It's a fast, affordable cheap microsd card. What more could I say? San disk too, so it's definitely a good brand to buy.",
"Must have for people who have an Amazon Prime account and an Echo. Portability and water resistant. Works great by the hot tub or pool, and let's you access the normal Alexis capabilities.",
This is a great little memory device. I now have several and they work without problem with my newer Android tablets. (Older versions before Jelly Bean have problems accessing all 64mB - jelly bean works great.),
"Name brand, great price, great shipping",
"Still working...fast. It's almost a mind-fart to think we can put this much (much more now of course) storage in such a tiny little space. Come on, I remember in the 90's when a 3 Gigabyte hard disk was $300!!! That was soooo expensive even considering inflation.This card, is much, much, much faster than my first 3 GB hard drive...sad...but cool...wait....ouch, headache!",
"I own the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 smartphone- and besides having a user-replaceable battery, this device also allows the user to pop in a Micro SD card.  More is better, too much is almost enough... and hence the 64-GB model, which permits storing insane numbers of songs on your phone-- in my case, over 7000!  (Three of the songs are great, 2 are OK, and the rest?  Not so good!)  Seriously- this is a 'must own' if your smart phone is not made by Apple!  If you own the iPhone, not so great, there are no user-accessible batteries or Micro SD cards in iPhones.  If you own Android- well, life will be considerably brighter once you pop this in, which took all of like 30 seconds.  You do not need to format it unless you wish to erase what you've already put on it.  Highly recommend - SanDisk is a trusted provider of flash memory devices, and buying from Amazon.com is a no-brainer.",
These are fantastic for laptops and tablets. I put all my music onto two cards and have all my music with me when I travel.,
"The item arrive in time, but was unfortunately defective as it would not accept a copy operation. Further investigation led to discovering the card had bad sectors. Refund is progressing without a hitch however, so not all was lost.",
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",

This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model. The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080). This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution. The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.Read more",
"I bought this SD card for use with my cell phone. It worked really well and as far as I could tell, transfers the data at a fast rate. No complaints.",
"This is one of those basic items that usually just work. In my case, I received one that just did not work. A couple of weeks ago, my phone reported an error and so I reformatted the card and transferred my music back onto it. Unfortunately it failed again two days ago and it won't even format now. I have had good luck with SanDisk before, but this one was not a good experience.",
"Not much to say about SD cards -- either they work or they don't.  This one appears well-built and required no formatting hassles and took to my Galaxy SIII as well as the original or better (the original Samsung card fried).  A month into it, and no problems.",
"UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more",

"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
Brand speaks for itselfRecommend to a size 64 GBPrice is a bit highSanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card,
Use in my Go Pro Hero 3+ works just as would be expected for a memory card. Price was good.,
This product has excellent quality! No problems so far. Fast reading and data transferring. I love it! Taking pictures like crazy without any worries. Reliable product indeed.,
"I was a bit concerned when I first ordered this microSD card.  Samsung's documentation says it is compatible with an SDHC card, but this one is SDXC.  I read a bunch on Google about incompatibilities, but they were older forum discussions.  I read the SDXC used to be incompatible, but that Samsung published an update late last year that allowed the Galaxy Note 10.1 to work with this card without the need for reformatting to a FAT file system.  For the price, I thought I didn't have much to lose and would give this a shot.My report:  The Galaxy Note 10.1 read the card perfectly when installed.  There was a small glitch where the Note asked to format the card after I removed it from the tablet and transferred about 25GB of data to the card (from my PC while it was in a card reader).  All I needed to do was to remove the card again, and reinsert and reboot the tablet, and the problem went away.  Have been using this for hours doing extensive read/writes to the card with no failures.  Will update if I have any issues, but for now, I am extremely pleased with the performance on this.",
no problem with setup on this.  Instructions were clear.  Quality of chip is high and I expect to get many years of service life from it.  When I'm finished with it I think I can use it with that jar of onion/sour cream dip I bought in 1985,
Has a very good Bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise she's pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions,
"The number 1 thing that's important about a product is that it works and works well, and this card does.Before purchasing, make sure your phone or camera supports this card. I'm currently using this with the Galaxy S3 and it's been working flawlessly. So far I have only used 16gigs of the sd card and the S3 phone loads everything in a couple of seconds every time I have restarted the phone.Just because the card is class 10 does not mean it will make your device faster. The device being used has to be capable of supporting the card for them to work together harmoniously.Also, some devices (like the Galaxy S3) do not require the card to be formatted and it can be used straight out of the box. With a 59 gig capacity (as the rest is reserved for the card software) I do not have to worry about running out of space anytime soon as I was with my previous 8 gig card.",
I almost got myself a 16GB but decided on the 32GB last minute.  I'm so glad I did - I filled up my Hero3 White edition with over 20k time-lapse images and a few hours of HD footage.  These things are solid and reliable.  I filled it up over a 6 day period doing some work in Haiti.,
"It amazing how much data they can fit on these tiny cards these days.  When I saw this 32gb class 10 card for $20, I snatched it up for my 10&#34; Android tablet to hold my library of kids DVD movies I converted to tablet video for my kids to watch while on the road.  It works great and the kids love it.",
excelent,
"There is a lot of conflicting info on the we about whether cards larger than 32gb work in this phone. The phone specs say that it only supports up to 32gb. I put it in, formatted it and got 59.7 gb of usable space, which is exactly what you would expect. I have been using it for ~3 weeks now and it has worked perfectly. Good price too.",
"By default it's formatted in exFAT, so don't expect your devices will recognize it if they don't support this system. The MS standard allows only 32 GB for FAT32. But who cares? :) There are free tools to format all 64 as FAT32. I personally used Linux and got it done in couple minutes. It was recognized by Samsung Tablet Note 10.1 right away. I will definitely buy one more for my other devices. One point to the people complaining about the speed. Both your device and adapter should support the speeds over 20 MB/S. If you try to use/test this card using USB2, then don't complain. :) You got what you wanted.",
"50 Despite the dirt cheap price, i find it to be great for casual use. Videos play nice, games even play nice, text is just not as sexy looking as higher resolution screens. Watch the video for full demo!The short/summed up version: it's the new budget king in the 6-8 size. It's screen is a little lower in resolution but still pleasant to look at, it has enough power for most of the typical tablet tasks, and it shares many of the same features as its higher priced brothers such as front and back cameras, b/g/n wifi, and good overall battery life (minus an hour) My favorite size tablet is 8, so if you're looking at the amazon fire lineup, i would take this over the 6 for sure, and would have a hard time picking the 8 fire at 3x the price. If you're not a prime member, it's still a good tablet, if you are a prime member: it's a great tablet.

"The first one had some sort of problem, and would stop responding to the phone or stop playing music, a reboot often fixed it for a period of time, but inevitably it would stop again.  Amazon replaced the unit quickly and the replacement works perfectly (I am so glad it wasn't my phone!).  I have almost 10,000 songs on my phone now, who needs a separate music player.  It would easily handle video, photos or a monster app collection as well, it's great taking a modest capacity phone and making it bigger than anyone else offers stock, for far less than you can buy the phone with the extra capacity.",

You are also correct to point out that this device does not support Mayday, although there are still multiple ways to get help for free directly from your device.

"Not much to say about this other than it works fine.  The included adapter was difficult to remove the microSDHC card from, but that may be due to my big fingers (plus the card is very small as one would expect from micro naming).  The speed is more than adequate with no buffering issues noticed from video capture on a phone at HD(720) resolution.  Recommended.",

It is fast and a great deal. You wont need anything bigger than this unless you are downloading tons of movies on your phone. it does its job quite well.,
"This is my third purchase. I own 4 of them and they've been working fine so far. I have them installed on my smart phone, cameras and even used as a portable storage device and I have not noticed any issues with them. Very good product.",
The SD to microSD card adapter that comes with this product is too small. It is impossible to remove the card from the adapter without damaging it.,
"I ordered this as soon as it was available and it arrived this morning. For background, I also have an Apple TV, which I hate but my kids love. I also have various WDTV models, Which I love. The reason the kids love the Apple TV is that the interface is so slick and quick, which the WDTV certainly lacks in. This Fire TV is even better IMO than the Apple TV and the WDTV doesn't even come close. Unfortunately, the Fire TV misses in a huge way for me by not allowing the play of external content through the USB port from attached storage or memory stick. If it had that capability, and hopefully it will in the future This would be the perfect device. This is why I am still hanging on to my WDTV as my go to player. It will play virtually any file format you throw at it which is a priority to me. I have been reading about the Plex app and that may satisfy my needs as well, but I haven't dug deeper or tested it out. If that is not the case for you, than the Fire TV would be a great option. I am not familiar with Roku, because I could never justify the purchase due to the inability to play content from local storage. Unfortunately I jumped the gun with the Fire TV because I saw that it did have a USB port and made the assumption it would support external content. Hopefully this will come in a future firmware release otherwise maybe Plex will be able to fill that gap for me. Bottom line, if external content is not important, I would recommend this Fire TV due to the availability of Prime content and the fact the interface is beautiful and very quick. The Apple TV should only be a consideration over this if you are a fanatic Apple loyalist, or you have a tremendous amount of itunes content you want to be able to utilize.",
"I bought this and put it my mobile phone - Samsung galaxy s3. I don't have a lot more to say. I put it in, formatted it, and it has been working very ewell for some months now. Seems to be very fast. No issues. Recommended.",
I bought it to my GoPro 3 Black and it worked very good with videos at 1080P...very cheap compared with the prices at Best Buy.,

"I recommend anybody to get the 64gb Scandisk Ultra from Amazon, if you are looking to expand your tablet or any device memory. This product was delivered on-time with simple to open packaging. Inserted into my Windows 8 tablet and was able to save, edit, and so on with no problem.",
"The read/write speeds are fantastic. Works great in my Galaxy Note 2. I absolutely love the space, it was worth every single penny.",
Received a defective one that did not want to format.  Returned it.  Bought a different brand instead although from past experience Sandisk has been fine.,
Works just like echo but portable!! Great stuff. As described!,
I bought this when it was on a special deal.  Am happy with my decision to purchase this and do recommend it.,
I use mine inside a dash camera which records continuously while the car is being driven. No problems so far. Having the SD adapter included is nice.,
"I got this to add more memory to my HTC EVO LTE phone. It works perfectly, is very fast on both reads and writes, and at 32GB, provides a lot of additional storage on top of the 8GB in the phone. I recommend this specific card for any Android phone. Sorry Apple users... No expansion slot for you! :)",
"I bought this as supplemental storage on my Asus Transformer TF201 tablet.  The card did not need any special formatting to work and just worked upon first installation. It stays plugged into my tablet non-stop and I've been using it for about 3 months for additional storage for music and videos without any problems.  I don't have any speed benchmarks, but I haven't noticed any slowness in copying or deleting large amounts of data on this device.  It does what it's supposed to, so therefore, I give it 5 stars!",
"I have other SD cards that begin to act a little buggy over time. All of my SanDisk cards are still running great, this card included.",
Great storage. Runs fast and gives me plenty of room. Probably overkill for my phone but I'm all about overkill!,
This is going to be used in a D-Link Pan and Tilt IP Camera.  I have other devices I have tested it in and it provides exactly the service it advertises.,
And you wouldn't believe what Sandisk put me through to get a warranty replacement.  However I finally got the replacement and it has been working fine ever since.,
Arrived on time and did everything as expected.More then enough cap to hold severail hours of recording_____ _______,
"This will be a very unscientific review as I did not conduct any benchmarks.Purchased this card for my Galaxy Note 2 since T-Mobile only offered the 16GB version of the phone.Review:I researched this purchase prior to buying it on Amazon so I was somewhat hesitant to purchase this card and have to jump through hoops to get it recognized by my Galaxy Note 2.When the card arrived I immediately put it into my phone.  The card was instantly recognized and the phone booted up and mounted the SD Card without any prompting.Boot seemed very fast, faster than the stock card that came with my phone.  Again, unscientifically, this card seems much much faster than my old card.  All my movies and photos seem to come up quickly without much delay.My usable space reported is 59.45GB.I highly recommend this card to anyone.  It is extremely fast and very easy to use (for my Galaxy Note 2 phone at least).Pros:-Phone boots faster-A lot of space to store movies, music and pictures-Worked the first time I plugged it in without any special hoops to jump throughCons:-None",
I have bought it for around 6 months. It works good so far & both read / write speed meet the described specification.,
"I have this in my phone, I use it for music and videos.Transfer speeds from my computer to the card are pretty speedy.It works great!",
"I bought 2 of these for my 2 sons to save their games, songs and whatever else on their DSs. Had more space than they will use in quite awhile. It was priced superbly!",
"Doing its thing, no complaints",
"What else can I say? That it is light and small? Not the fastest card on the market, but does the job. Copying files onto it is slow, but it is fast enough to play music or movies from it on your cellphone or other devices.",
"This card runs great on my AT&T Note II, but it took some work to get exFAT working. Stock ROM, rooted, custom kernel. I can't vouch for an unrooted, bone-stock device. However if you use custom kernels and want the benefits of exFAT, you have to find an exFAT-compatible kernel. I didn't realize this and thought the card was working, but after installing a compatible kernel, everything runs great.",
"I bought this memory card for my smartphone (Nokia Lumia 521) when my older 8GB micro SD card died on me (amazon basics brand).I threw on some MP3s on there to listen on my phone on my trip up the California coast since I knew some areas wouldn't have any radio or cell phone reception, and had no problems with it.I haven't done any speed tests on it as I'm not using it for anything that needs extreme speeds. Its has more than enough speed for capturing video and and pictures.Its a great deal for the amount of storage and its price.",
"SanDisk is one of the top brands for removable memory. As expected, this worked right out of the package. I use it with my GPS.",
Was hesitant to purchase but then my 'regular' phone sd card died and so decided to go for this class 10 for my tablet... excellent choice.,
I bought one for my note 3 and one for my girlfriend and her S4. She takes a lot of pictures and I have a lot of music on my phone so we both wanted the extra room. The cards read and write quickly also.,
Purchased this to use with our compact digital camera. This works as needed and runs quickly. As this is a class 10 it is to be expected. A great buy at a great price.,
"I'm currently using this product in my Canon Digital Camera, I took over 120 pictures & 20 videos while on vacation in Escondido, Mexico  with more than 85% room still left on the card! Also with me using a micro SD Card, if I wish to send the picture right away I can easily just snap the card into my cell phone to post the pictures to Facebook or email for example?",
"I don't have too much to say about an SD card, but I wanted to at least give it the 5 stars it deserves. We used it in a Galaxy S3 and it has worked flawlessly so far. I haven't  run any benchmarks to confirm the speed, etc but it does not seem to hinder the phone or camera (which we now have saving photos/videos to the SD card) in any way.I will point out the The S3 camera app did notify us that burst mode shots will still write to the phone's internal memory. Potentially due to the high date of data being written. That's good to know if you use burst mode a lot and were hoping to use an SD card for that purpose.",
"I recently received my Amazon Fire TV after months of researching which streaming device would be the best. Basically what you are paying for is the internal specs, which Amazon has every other device beat by far. The software limitations I am confident will be resolved soon, like HBOGo and Amazon MP3 apps being added. We got this device to replace cable/dish. With subscriptions to Netflix DVDs, Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus, there is very little we are missing by streaming and much we are saving The folks complaining about Hulu stopping in the middle of programming, I have had this happen here and there, but it has been at peak Internet use times only. During the day, when folks are at work, I have had 0 problems streaming. Just make sure you have good, high speed internet and a cable modem router that can fully support the number of devices being used at one time. I am totally happy with our purchase of the Amazon FireTV",
"My hubby is now complete and very happy that he has ths for his Go Pro. Haven't tested it out yet, but we will soon.",
"The first one I received kept unmounting from my Samsung Galaxy S4.  It was a new phone so I wasn't sure if the problem was the memory card or the phone, but I sent the card back for a replacement and the second one has worked fine.  Just under 6000 songs loaded uses just over half the space.  Love that!",
"When I purchased my Kindle Fire HD 8, this was the recommended case at checkout. I purchased it thinking that an Amazon sourced cased should work and fit well. I'm very happy with my choice of this case both with its style/look and function. The price is much lower than that of the case in which I keep my Kindle Paperwhite but is still fairly expensive given the cost of the Fire.To my match my black Kindle Fire, I chose the charcoal black version which is actually a tweed style look in various shades of gray and black. It has the look and feel of fabric versus the plastic covers I have used on my Paperwhite. The inside is a black microfiber cloth for screen protection. It does not have an internal pocket. My Kindle Fire fits securely in the plastic shell and can stand both landscape and portrait with a flip of the case.The case has a magnetic cover which keeps it shut or open without the front cover having to be held manually in place. Whether the case is open or closed, the ports for charging, the MicroSD port and headphones as well as the control function buttons are exposed. When it is closed, the cover covers the speakers and the front facing camera lens. When the cover is fully open and folded to the back, the rear camera lens is covered (the front facing lens is fully exposed when the case is open.) If you wish to use the camera for photos or video while it is in the case, you can hold the front cover in your off-hand while it is in use.As I have a tendency to leave my Paperwhite on (and run down the battery fairly regularly), I appreciate that this cover automatically turns itself off and on when you close or open it.",
Use this in my Samsung galaxy s4. Never have an issue. I recommend at least a 32 gigabyte card if you have a smart phone,
"The card I received works perfectly in my Samsung Note 2. It comes with a converter to normal SD size, and I used it to copy music and photos from my iMac to the card. It picked up straight away in my mobile device and works fast enough for taking pictures and videos with the mobile.Delivery was fast as usual from Amazon, and packaging was good.On a sidenote, I own a couple of DSLR cameras and generally prefer the SanDisk brand for my memory cards. I've seen other brands fail at the most inappropriate of times, but never had a failure on a SanDisk.",
"Due to other reviews I was a little hesitant to order this unit.  My experience was pain free; I installed it and powered-on the phone.  My Lumia 810 (WP8) automatically recognized the new memory and prompted me to use it for new pictures, music and videos.  Hoorary!",
"Major issues, bought FROM san disk but only worked briefly, now when I try to reformat it reports itself as a 30 meg removeable drive in both windows and macos--not sure if its defective or a mislabeled one--but got direct from amazon so just very disapointed. Will stick with transcend from now on I think.",
"I've had this Kindle for a while now. Many of the reviews say it all so I don't think I could add much. But I feel like I need to speak on behalf of this Kindle to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought. If this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it. So I have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us allDo you have any clue what you bought Let's all say it out loud: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!!!!!! It is an entry level model with no light. Amazon has always sold non lighted Kindles, and I still have many of them. They are a cheap way to get into the e-reader scene. Can you read a real book in the dark Of course not. So these non lighted Kindles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light. It is ridiculous to buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because it doesn't have a light. Read the product descriptions. This Kindle has no light, the Paperwhite and Voyage do.Scream all to the heavens: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE PAGE TURNING BUTTONS!!!! To buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because your old Kindle had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane. Could you not see when you clicked on BUY that this Kindle had no page turning buttons. Sometimes I think there are two kinds of Kindle owners: those who want page turning buttons and those who don't mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page. If you can tell by my sarcasm, I belong to the latter bunch.Then of course there are the technically deficient that have no clue what wifi is, are unable to sign on, and blame it on the Kindle. BAM! another 1 star review.Read more",
Great companion if you already have an echo and need something on the go. Love that this stream and plays Prime music. Battery life could be a little better and sound is good for speaker this size but not the best.,
Amazing price for this micro SD.  Brings adapter with it.  Class 10.  Great product. I am very happy with this purchase.,
Simply excellent.  This is the second 32 GB Ultra I have purchased for my Samsung Galaxy II.  Both are working perfectly.  Data access rate is exceptional for movies.  System both stores and overrides data very easily.,
"This is an ultra fast SanDisk branded SD card that's great for digital cameras, especially for video. I got it for my smartphone, mainly for the 32 GB capacity, and it fills the bill at a very low price with Prime shipping. You can't get better quality flash cards than SanDisk. I'm still amazed that they can cram such a huge amount of memory on such a tiny chip.  One megabyte of data in text from printed out would fill a pickup truck. This chip has 32 thousand megabytes.  Think about having 32,000 pickup trucks full of text in a chip smaller than your pinky fingernail!",
"I wanted one of these badly, in fact I ordered two. Aside from someone stealing the first package they sent me, I am glad I could just go on amazon, see the super cheap price and have it delivered in 2 days, which is quicker than I could go and get one living here in NYC.  Now I have tons of stuff I can quickly load onto it and put into my Asus Transformer t700 instead of waiting for the super slow usb cable transfer directly to the tablet.  The other one I put in my Galaxy S4, which is sheer overkill but I dont have to worry about running out of space",
"I bought this Micro SD card to replace the cheap no-name card I had been using in my Nextboox tablet for the last six months or so.  When the Brand X card suddenly stopped working, I opted to spring for the extra $$ and buy a branded replacement.  So far, everything is working fine.  I hope I am not disappointed six months from now and have to replace this one, too.",
"Product works as advertised. No issues with install or general use in my mobile phone. It doesn't seem particularly snappy, but that may be more the phone than anything else.",
I have this installed in my BlackBerry Z10. I have the camera on my phone set to store directly to this little card. It's really a great feeling to take photos all day long and not worry about filling the card up. I really recommend it if you have a phone that allows for external memory expansion. Sorry iPhone users.,
"Love this chip,... bought this for my Samsung S4, it works well and fast.... No issues with it, so I bought one for my mom....",
Works great in the GO PRO. too big for my PC to recognize it in the adapter  though with Windows XP. Have not tried 8 yet.,
Got this on sale for 100! Replaces my 500 cds! Must buy as long as you have Prime!,
It does the job and the price was right. It came quickly so I'm very happy for the purchase.  I would recommend it and would but it again.,
"I ordered this for my son and he loves it. More memory space than the one I have of 32. I plan on getting another one for me because I love to download a lot of videos, music, and take pictures",
"Quick speeds and a ton of memory.If you have an expandable slot, get this.It was nice being able to store all my photos, videos, and music on my phone finally.",
Received undamaged in protective package within delivery schedule of provided estimate.  Provided adapter not used.  Memory Card inserted in Garmin 5000 series GPS.  Fit good.  Works good. Did not test actual card speed.,
Bought this for my new Samsung Galaxy S4.  It worked right away with no troubles.  Only time will tell. :),
"I liked the color; liked that I didn't have to worry about it getting confused with other microSD cards that I had lying around.  It functions as I expected, given that it was made by SanDisk",
Works well no problems with SanDisk products. Always a good risk to use this brand of card. Price was right and shipping was fast.,
"This was a great deal and now I have plenty of storage space for my phone.I can store my ringtones, hundreds of songs and at least 6 movies.This is also the  new micro-SDXC Card which is designed for high speed transfer.",
"Not a steal at $62 but anything under $1 per GB is a decent price for high end SanDisk Class 10 memory. The real value was in being assured of authentic SanDisk product and a very fast delivery. I would buy again from this seller.  The 64GB microSD installed, reformatted to NSFS with no issues, and performs as advertised.",
"The product is excellent, so far. It fits my smartphone and tablet also excellent in recording in HD also performing on an HD monitor.So far, all SanDisk cards (regular and Micro, have performed very well.excellent for my needs. I use three sizes 8 gigs for my Archos MP player and 16/32 gigs for my smartphone and tablet.My no name tablet has a micro HDMI port that works very well.",
Can't tel you much about it. Its a memory card and I can't compare it to other products out there.,
This is the third card I've ordered and I will buy a fourth when needed. The frustration free packaging is amazing! It's an envelope that has a pull-tab. Can't get any simpler than that! The card itself is a class 10+ and I have not had any issues with any of the ones I've bought. This one went to my brother to upgrade the storage on his phone.,
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
"With the onboard memory, plus this expansion card, my android tablet has more memory than my iPad.  Can I tell if the fast memory is really fast?  No, not really.  It seems to be compatible with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, no error messages, so I guess life is good.",
"I finally have enough room for everything.  I formatted my 64gb Sandisk micro SD card using EaseUS Partition Master 9.2.1 Home Edition.  I used the FAT32 format.  My T-Mobile Prism phone read the card giving me 59.47 gb free.  My Samsung Galaxy 2 7.0 tablet read it the same way.  I am very happy that any of my devices will read this card when I format it as FAT32.  There is enough room to hold my my entire CD collection (300 cds), my entire book collection (250+ books), and my entire collection of sermons (I lost count).  I still have 23gb left!!!  I am too happy.  Bottom line, folks, if my cheap android phone will read it, so will everything else.  Who needs cloud drives and streaming when you can take it with you!!!!  Thank God for Sandisk,  I am hoping someone comes up with 128gb soon. hahaha!",
"Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version. For my 7 version review, please search for my HDX 7 review.My profile: Im a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do. It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more",
"No problem; it fits and it seems fast.  The colors are a good addition because when it pops out on the floor or something, you can find it.",
I use this in my phone and transfer information back an forth from phone to laptop. Great for holding lots of items. Have no problems with it and will probably get another or larger size,
Can never go wrong with SanDisk products. You never run into the problem of needing to reformat the disk and I usually store my music on it and plug it into my car instead of carrying an annoying ipod which needs to be synced all the time for new music. With microSD you just drag and drop :),
"Really the gold standard.  I will reserve 5 stars until they blow me away on the price.  Otherwise, this is an excellent buy.",
I bought this for my Galaxy S4 to expand its storage capacity and it has worked great.  Fast transfer speeds as well.,
"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more",
"I've purchased several of these little babies over the years, and I always buy SanDisk. I've never had one fail, the price is great for the amount of storage you get.",
"Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good.",
i have this in  my go pro hero 3 black.  works good hold a ton of videos and pics.  fair price after shopping around thanks prime!  this is the maximum the go pro can take so have at it!,
This sd card is perfect for my phone. It is the right size and especially the right price. After looking all over Amazon price for this card was almost $10 lower than everyone else's.,
Worked well after reformatting. Good thing I was able to download the free app on line after reformatting. Memory to spare. I like being able to download and snap photos without thinking how much space left in the phone.,
"While out and about in a photo shoot I had this card fail on me. Luckily I'm a backup freak and was just starting out for the day so I only lost a few pictures. Card completely died and had to be sent back to Sandisk for a replacement.The whole process took a little over a week and communication was excellent so 5 stars on sandisk support.I know about memory so I always have multiple cards available and if I'm out for an extended time, spread my work out over cards to minimize risk.What about the average person who throws all their data on this disk and looses precious memories. Sure  they are at fault for not backing up their data. Unless you are shooting HD videos though, chances are you're not going to fill this card up in a day.Unless you either need the storage for HD video or something or your data is not important I'd say it makes more sense to just get several  16GB cards equaling 64GB at roughly the same or less price depending on brand.Again Sandisk support was great and they even asked if I needed data retrieved. I can't recommend this card though.",
as fast as amazon prime 2 day shipping...its rocking inside my samsung galaxy s4! plug and play fun!now i have all the space i need with all the speed i want!,
"Ok first off, if you are looking to get one of these things dont put all your eggs on one basket as far as other reviewers go. The bad ones I think are just haters, apple lovers, people who dont have one, or have nothing better to do but to not give thing a proper review.I got mine yesterday and had a few hours to play with it and use it. I have XBox 360 and used that for my Netflix and Amazon Prime but wanted something else to do that with. So Amazon came out with this and ordered it. Here is a list of good and bad. But understand I dont own apple or Roku.The Good:1. The speed and response on this thing is VERY VERY fast.2. The video quality is great. It truly is 1080p. I think that is better the what my XBox puts out3. The sound quality is great. I used a HDMI plugged it in to my 5.1 and sounds great.4. The hook up was very easy and straight forward. It is a plug and play.5. Hooking up to home network was very simple. I use the wireless and it so far runs flawlessly.6. The remote is small and very simple and not complicated very straight forward and very smooth.7. The movie and show load up time is very instant. With my Netflix it took no time at all to load up unlike my Xbox.8. This is the best part I thing anyway and so far no has said anything about this is...That you can take it with you on a trip. As long as the T.V has a HDMI and you can get on the wireless you can watch your programs or movies on any T.V. I think that is the best part about it all.9. It is small and very light.10. The voice search works really well.Cons and these may not be cons or bad for you.1. The voice search will only find movies or programs on Amazon Prime. But from what I hear that is cause of a deal thing with the other providers and that may change in the further.2. You can not power it down or put it to sleep. But for me that is no big deal. And really you can just unplug it if you want.Summery:Over all I find this unit works really well and it is very responsive. I have yet to see any lag with the things that I have watched or played with.Note: I have not used the games for this so this is only for the programs. I put it through its paces for the few hours that I have used it and so far I think that Amazon did a pretty good job with this.Note: After looking at the box and reading the back of the box there is a note that says there will be a Spring 2014 update. So my thinking is that the stuff that is missing or things that are not there will be coming soon. Just remember that this JUST came out a few days ago and I am sure that things will only get better in time.",
"I had been using a no name micro SD card in my phone for a while now. It was made by 3C, but it was 16GB and class 10 for really cheap. It actually didn't give me any problems at all so would buy another one in a heartbeat.Anyways, my son wanted more games on his PSP (my PSP actually) so I used that 16GB card there with an adapter so I was in the market for a new card.I got this card because I trust the SanDisk brand, it was 32GB, and the price was cheaper than most. I plugged it in my phone and have not had a problem at all. I can't tell you anything specifically positive, but that is okay in my book considering it means I don't have anything negative to say either. No news is good news sometimes. Everything is smooth and there are no issues. I would buy this card again, recommend it to anybody who needs one, or buy a larger size from them when the time eventually comes.",
"I am not pleased, every movie I select is a pay for view. It's a good thing Netflix on it. Every movie that is a pay for view can be found on Netflix. I don't need this device, Netflix is available on Cable one.",
received my Kindle and it was in good shape package not Damaged.I see the difference with the kindle fire HD compared to HDX cause their isn't any.One has camera and the other didn't. I plan on keeping my KINDLE fire Hd Thanks amazon I love it.,
Works great with the HD 720P Dual Lens IR Night Vision Car DVR Camera Dash Cam Video Recorder Motion Detection.,
"I have always been a sandisk guy.  This cards works both in my note 3 and s4, gives me 119gb after format.  Can't ask for much more, including the fact that sandisk stands by their products and has excellent customer service.  I could never imagine buying  a micro sd , sd , or ssd from anyone else.",
I used this i my GoPro 3 Black and it worked flawlessly. Shooting at 47 FPS in HD without a hitch.,
"Most mobile devices and tablets that are of any count state that the limit to their sd storage is 32GB...but on a few of those they can and do read sd cards that are in fact larger than this.  I would suggest anyone that thinks they need space beyond those stated limits of their device do a quick search on line for their particular MAKE and Model cellphone or tablet to see what size SD's others have been successful at using. Once you have found out and that you can in fact use such an SD...go and search online for HDD Raw Copy Tool from HDD GURU...and it will allow you to make an image of your old SD to apply to the new SD and/or even make a backup of one's SD.  Since the SD drives are different sizes when this image is applied to the larger...you will need to use a partition manager, such as MiniTool partition wizard (which is free for home use) and resize the partition of the larger drive.  This will allow you to take advantage of the whole drive space. I love the upgrade and added space...can't go wrong with this price for a class 10 SD of this size.",
I remember when I built computers that had 5' x 3' 2GB hard drives; and by now most have Googled to learn of the room sized computers with basketball sized transistors.Micro computer; how long before our entire life will fit on something smaller than the point of a needle . . .?This SDXC disk has worked well with my Nokia Lumia Windows 8 phone. My wife has one in her Android phone and with kids taking pictures and making movies 64GB is starting to look like to little an amount of storage.,
"After I put this card in my new S4, my camera would hang and just not respond to anything. Some apps also stopped working.  I put in my old 16GB card and everything worked fine.",
"Works great! Perfect price,I'm using mine for my digital camera, and my DJI Phantom FC40.The chip holds tons of data and is exactly what I needed!Highly recommend for anyone needing both micro and standard SD. It's great to have the ability to plug and play to get the data!Buy it, Buy it! BUY IT!For the money I should have got the 64GB card.I will be buying more.",
I purchased this to use with my Samsung tablet. It works perfectly and stores a lot of information. I would buy this product again. SanDisk knows how to make memory cards that last!,
I am a huge fan of Amazon. Every one of my kindles have been an up grade from the last. All have delivered the highest quality and the best service. I highly recommend them to everyone. My HDX is awesome.,
What a bargain!  64GB of memory for all of your music and movies.  I bought this and the Galaxy S4 and couldn't be happier.  This much memory in an iPhone would cost an arm and leg.Comes with a SD size attachment so you can easily transfer files straight from your computer.,
"Worked great in my galaxy s4 and died about 2 months later, what a waste of a lot of money!",
"I am thoroughly impressed with my Echo Dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs. a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop. The construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the Echo. This case/cover will give your Echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in, but still offer the great functionality of Alexa.",
Good transfer speed,
Crashed... Lost everything... Thanks SanDisk.  Used in gs4..not a solid product couple years worth of stuff gone in an instant.,
"purchased in Florida so the price was just fab, the card is excellent and very fast with my Gopro hero 3 and an absolute must",
This super micro SD card was required for the Sony Action Cam that I bought for use with my Phantom quad copter. Super small and therefore easy to misplace. I like my CF cards I use for my cameras because you can hold on to them better. I like sandisk products as that's all I use.,
"This is a great disk and I have never had any problems with the product.  What can you say positive or negative about a product that does it's intended purpose of storing memory.  Well made, simple to use, and never a problem to date!",
"It's an sd card, this one's fast. The read and write speeds are pretty equal on this one. Approaching 20mbits per second for read and write. I installed linux to this drive for my cubieboard. Yeah, read and write speed would definitely be an ultimate determiner of over all system performance with this credit card sized computer.Sandisk makes nice stuff don't they?",
I use this with my GoPro 3+ Black. It works well. It'd be nice if it came with a little USB 3.0 reader like some other brands.,
Not cheap but really quite amazing that they can now fit so much info on such a small item. Already have a 16 GB version and expect this will perform the same. Comes with an adapter and also a plastic case that holds both the micro sd card and adapter which is nice.Almost wish they made a bigger capacity version as I use this with a GoPro and even this 64 GB model will fill up quickly.,
"No complaints matched description, was delivered on time and works well. Would easily recommend this to anyone looking to memory for their mobile device etc",
"Fast memorycard, the only type of memory card I'll purchase. I've grown as they have grown. 4, 8, 16, 32,64 GB",
"Catch them on sale here on Amazon! High speed, qualitty vendor (SanDisk), high capacity micro sd card. Highly recommended to anyone. Using in my Microsoft Surface and Windows Phone 8.",
This card has worked flawlessly in my phone for about three months! I had an smaller and slower card in it that this replaced. When doing pictures and video you can definitely tell the difference in write speed between a class ten and four.,
"What they charge at retailers for SD Cards is ridiculous.  I always order via Amazon, and never a dissapointment!  Great SD Card, works great, as expected.",
"Simply put the card works well in my NOTE 3, gives me the extra space needed and to date has worked flawlessly. I upgraded from a 64GB Sandisk to the 128GB with no issues. Plenty of space available now in my phone and I can keep movies and music local. Some people have scoffed online about using such a large card but the reality of it is that you don't always have data service and when that time comes, such as when you're on a plane, its nice to have access to some movies and music that you've kept on local storage.So far its worked in my NOTE 3 and SG4.",
Pros:Maximum external storage for my SGS3.Plenty of space on my phone now to store music and pictures.Fast data transfer.Cons:none.Other:Shipped super fast (think i actually got it next day) packaged well.,
works as advertised.  Wish more companies made good products.  I still have plenty of storage available and it runs quick and safely.,
"First off, I've always bought Sandisk for the warranty under the reasoning that a lifetime warranty means they must be a little better than the others and Sandisk's lesser lines. I have 5 Class 6 SD 8GB Extreme III series cards all pushing 5 years old now with zero problems, all of which write nearly twice as fast. Not sure what the limitation is, Class 10 UHS-1, and 5 year newer tech should blow these away.  The 'micro' packaging shouldn't make a difference either.  I can only guess it's marketing differentiation.Again this card will write at published specs but you may want to check out the Sony SR32UYA/TQMN of the same capacity, it reads and writes faster and is a similar price, though only a one year warranty. I picked it up with a Hisense 7 Pro tablet (awesome) and couldn't wait, and they were on sale locally for $26. Was a pleasant surprise. Came with a SD adapter as well and some file recovery software (a link).  Not a fan of Sony web sites support or or documentation for any of their gear the last 15 years but these are commodities now I suppose and you can't expect much any longer. I now kind of think if these things work 30 days, they'll probably work 5-10 years until they are obsolete. FYI:The Sandisk and Sony are both made in China.",
"They work great and I haven't had any issues with these cards.  I don't like using the adapters, but in a pinch I also used this in my Canon HS300 camera for 1080 video and photos with no issue.  They have very fast read/write speeds and have been quite reliable so far for me.",
"This is a great product. I also have a Dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus, the hands free mode works just like the Dot, and the sound is great. I use the Tap all the time; working on projects, making shopping lists, playing games, to turning on the lights. I looked at the Echo but even with a battery pack it didn't seem very mobile.",
"I use this in my Samsung Galaxy SIII and it has been great. There have been a few instances when the card was not recognized, but simply rebooting the phone fixed the problem. I am unsure whether this is a Samsung issue (probably), or a SanDisk issue, but it has only happened 2 to 3 times over the course of a year and a half. Overall, the write speeds are fast enough that you can record 1080p video directly to the card, which is exactly what I wanted it for. It does come with a full-size SD card enclosure, allowing you to use this in devices that require that type of memory card. Recommended!",
"This has been a very nice addition, it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it.",
"Called GoPro - they recommended this specific card.  They said the 64GB cards have been causing problems.  You can run your GoPro Hero3 with 2x Batteries attached to it, and you still won't fill up this card (even on HD Video).I went on a 2 week surf voyage across Hawaii and 2 of these badboys documented my whole trip!",
Its in my GoPro and the memory card easily captures 2 hrs of video.It can get more the battery only lasts 2 hrs.,
"I really like the Fire TV box so far. The voice search thing is pretty good, but I just wish it had the ability to surf the internet.",
This product works great with my amazon account and best part is it does not listen too all my conversations. While it is an option I prefer to hit the button for it to recognize a voice command. That way its not listening till I tell it to unlike Google's device and the other amazon devices.,
"Great sound and portablebility. Nice style, lithium battery, requires wifi and there are internet radio stations and news. Amazon has features available as well. I use mine a lot.",
It's pretty and matches my Fire tablet and I like that it's slim and doesn't add a lot of bulk to the tablet. It could be improved if it had a hand strap to make holding it easier but I bought a separate hand strap that fits with it.,
"I recently upgraded from my trusty Droid X to the Samsung Galaxy S4.Given it's hi-def videos and pictures I wanted a big and fast memory card.This faster card loads the gallery so much faster than one in the X.Otherwise, it's a memory card and it works well.",
This is a nice item..I can set reminders get news and weather..all by the tap of a button,
"Works great in the Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. I purchased one for my phone and one for my son's phone and they both work great! We've had no problems with either card. My son loves that he was able to put his whole music library, several translator apps and bible versions, along with several movies on his phone to take with him on a mission trip to Peru and still had room to store thousands of photos he took while there. Being able to use a card like this is one of the main reasons I switched from an iPhone to an S3. Love it!",
"Just got a new Razor Max HD with 32 GB and wanted to add more memory, paid a few more bucks for Sandisk and it's always worth it!  The phone recognized the additional memory and I'm good to go with 64 GB now.",
"I got this for my Samsung Galaxy Note. After reading various reviews and comparing different micro SD cards, I decided to get this. One of the main reason was because of the speed of this card (UHS-1). The card has been good to me and I'm happy with my purchase.",
"Arrived fast, unpacked easily, installed quickly, operates without problems.  I am happy with the purchase. It's currently installed on my Samasun ATIV Smart PC",
"I have only had this for about 2 months and it is already dead. My GoPro doesnt see the memory card, my PC doesnt see the memory card, both of my laptops do not see it.",
My old microsd causes images taken to get corrupted probably because of the write speed it can't handle. This one works great! It has been a a few months and it still working good. I haven't seen any problem at. It seems pretty fast compare to my old  transcend. I would recommend it as Sandisk is already proven. It might cost a little more but it seems more reliable.,
"first off i got mine at wal-mart but i'm considering the 64GB version as of now but the 16GB card i have is really fast i've actually transferred all i can to it from my Galaxy SIII because for what ever reason it reads of the card faster than it does from the phones internal 16GB of memory?!?!? i've always used snadisk stuff everything from flash drives, sd cards, and now even a SSD! they make great stuff",
"Great MicroSD, fast and holds a ton of memory.  If you really need one buy it and you won't be disappointed.",
Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Tab3. Transfer speeds are excellent with this card.I would recommend this card to everyone.,
"Was working fine for 2 months. Randomly stopped working. Is not recognized by my computer or cell phone. I am beyond the Amazon return window, so this absolutely sucks.Wasted my money.",
"Got this for Galaxy Note 2. Started receiving ""unexpectedly removed"" messages. Now card is dead and no longer working.  This can be Googled for known issues. Will be contacting Amazon for replacement.  Felt compelled to share.",
"I purchased this item to expand my Samsung Galaxy tab3 7.0 memory and it fit well and is what I wanted, I would recommend this item.",
I live in a small apartment and this fan kept the whole place cool.,
"Super fast reading and writing. This thing performs under extreme condition; writing multiple large files, videos and photos, all at the same time. Have owned it for about 2 weeks now, and extremely happy with it.Formatting is super easy and fast",
Out of the three different brands of micro sd cards the Sandisk is the only one that is still with me.  the other two just quit working.  I have bought several more of these cards and have had no problem except I wished I would have bought ones with more memory.  excellent product.,
I bought this as a Christmas gift and it sounds amazing. And of course the integration is wonderful too.,
"I bought this for my GoPro and it does great. The only problem I experience with it is, if you download your pictures and videos from the day, you should re-format the card before trying to use it again. It seems to get confused where you left off when you re-install it. I lost out on getting some pictures and video because of not doing this on the second day of my SCUBA vacation. When I would start the GoPro in video mode, it would record about 6-15 seconds then stop automatically. Haven't have anymore problems since re-formatting after each night's downloading. The videos, set on 1080 looks great.",
SanDisk is a great product all around.  I bought this for my son's Samsung Galaxy Tab and it fit perfectly.  We've thrown about three movies on there already and I'm planning on adding a couple more.  I would definitely guy from them again.,
"rec and was happy.  good price, but we get want we pay for. the scan dic. would no por matt",
"Holds lots of data with fast read/write capabilities. Sometimes I wish I had gone for the 64GB version, but the 32GB is great for adding memory to a SSD tablet like the Surface Pro.",
"I bought this card because I hope to transition from a PC to a smartphone in the near future. For now I use an adapter to run it on the PC. The write times aren't as good as I had hoped, but they're acceptable overall. Plenty of storage space for my files, some of my music, pics, that sort of thing. Have also run portable applications on it and they seem to perform well for the most part. Overall, a solid little card with just enough speed to get the majority of my tasks done.Sidenote: the card came formatted with exFAT by default. The onyl way I could downgrade to FAT32 was to use a third party app. For some reason, the card can't be read by my phone, but the phone is an older model Samsung, so that could be the issue.",
"I inserted this into my Galaxy Note, powered the phone on and went into storage. I pressed on 'mount sd card' it said it didn't understand the filesystem and asked if I wanted to format it. I did and then I saw 59 gigs of free space.Works great and got it for 43 bucks off Amazon.Con:It's extremely slow to write to. If I try to write a 3gb file from my PC to the card it takes about 26 minutes (2MB a sec). If I write to the internal SD card on my phone it writes at 10MB a sec. I don't understand why it's that slow. I can accept that it will be slower than an internal SD however I didn't know it would be dog slow. My 32GB samsung micro sd was much faster...",
I love my new toy. Alexa is my personal girl Friday. She understands what I want and retrieves it. Easy to set up and use.,
There really isn't much to say about a micro SD card: it either works or it doesn't. I bought this to install in my phone and it seems to be working fine. The fit was perfect and the performance is totally satisfactory. I've never had any trouble with SanDisk products and this will likely be no exception. It was a great value compared to places I had priced locally.,
"I use this card in a Galaxy Note 10.1 and I have been very pleased with its performance.  It is noticeably faster than the class 4 card I replaced.  I use it for storing (and then watching) movies, and it plays them back with no observable buffering time.  It is also fast for writing photos or videos that I shoot using the camera on the tablet.  And the cost was among the lowest for cards of this storage size and speed class.",
Got for my Samsung Galaxy Tab2 7.0 . Plugged it in and it works.That is about all there is to it.,
"Perfect card for my Galaxy S3 - lots of capacity at a decent price, and not a no-name brand either.",
You can take everywhere your music and with wifi you are connected with the world. The best is that the battery lasts a long time.,
"With the adapter I can easily use it in my camera, tablet, desktop P.C. & &#34;Smart&#34; T.V. &#34;Es muy bueno&#34; !",
This memory card works like any other card.  I've hard zero problems with it and it was easy to install.  I would buy it again.,
"Got this to plug into a 1/2 adapter for the Raspberry Pi. I had to play with the Pi case a bit, but it all fits nicely without the full size sd card sticking out.",
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
I bought a new phone and got this chip because it was the largest the phone would accept.  I keep a lot of pictures on it.  100% satisfied.,
Purchased this for my Galaxy S3 phone. The phone has 16 GB internal memory and you can't use this with it. Luckily it came with an adapter and I use it in my card reader for storage. I go from the PC to the phone. Its worth the money but remember its useless with the Galaxy S3,
"I HAVE BOTH THE ECHO AND THE TAP, THEY ARE SPECTACULAR",
"I used this for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 . Like the others are saying, it had to be formatted in Fat 32. You can put your apps on your SD card with an app called ""Link2SD"". You just have to partition the SD card in order to be able to use it. Whether you get this card or a smaller one, you need one period for the Tab 2 because you can't do much without a wifi connection if you just have the internal memory and you want to download a lot of apps.",
got as a gift. Might not have got for my self- but love it and glad I had a birthday - lol,
Use this all the time in the GoPro. It's a great buy! Super cool that it comes with a SD adapter too!,
Shopped around a bit and this was by far the best deal on this card. Works great in Galaxy S3.,
"Sandisk is a very reputable company, and this class10 microsdhc card is quick.  I use it in my Galaxy S3 and it records video and photos without skipping a beat.",
Sandisk has the name but in my experience the quality and speed is not there. My lexar lasted longer and outperformed this chip.,
I bought this to use with a portable radio that accepts the micro memory card.  The 581 pieces of music I put on it took up less than 4 Gig so I have used it with the adapter in a camera as well.  It  does the job,
Works just fine for the Go-Pro I bought a few months ago. It's works just great for what it's made for.,
The memory card works as advertised and I have had no issues while using it with my GoPro Hero 3.,
It was good until I lost it in the house.  I think they should put a big ass light on it so I won't loose it.,
This worked in a Sansa clip zip when another generic brand didn't.  No complaints other than a couple CBS higher price.,
"The memory card was exactly what I was looking for. It came on time, in fact it came early. Now I have upgraded the memory for my tablet and can download movies to take with me any time I need to.",
I LOVE THE FIRE TV. IT IS JUST FANTASTIC. I AM NOW NOW WATCHING MY ULTRAVIOLET COLLECTION WITH FLIXSTER APP FROM FIRE TV AND PLAYS ABSOLUTLELY FANTASTIC.,
I love this 64 GB microSD.  I dont ever have to think about it now.  I love that we can get such a large amount of memory for our devices.,
"Had to format on my computer because I wanted to use with AOKP and needed to get FAT32, but once done the performance has been excellent :)",
Works as advertised. This is better for using with the newer products. I have noticed a increase in speed with my Note 2 and Note 8 when compared with previous version of SanDisk micro SD.,
"At 32 GB, this holds plenty of music, movies, apps and files. At about 75 cents a gig, this is a great deal.",
"I bought two of these from a major electronics retailer to make sure I don't get a bootleg one and they both crapped out on me. I usually buy from amazon but I needed them rig away . So unless that company has bought a large batch of bootleg cards or maybe I'm retarded. I bought them from the same store but different locations. I have switched brands now. Not taking anymore chances just in case a flood of bootleg ones hit the retail chains too. It worked fine at first but as the card filled up both times, both times they died and my pc or phone couldn't reformat it or recognize it. Good luck if you buy this major name brand, I thought they were the best too but not for me I guess.",
It's hard to believe how affordable digital has become. 32 GB in a device one quarter the sie of postage stamp would have been science fiction less than a generation ago.I picked this up for portable music when I didn't want to schlep (or risk) a phone or iPod. Works great with all SD card readers.Select with confidence.,
Can charge and take anywhere in the house! Holds a long charge.,
The recent map update on my Garmin GPS ran it out of memory.  Maps are getting more and more detailed.  I used this to up the memory and got back to the Full North America Map. It cam with the adapter to fit my PC SD slot too.,
Great transfer speeds for my Tablet. Going on a month now and it works just fine. Highly recommend it to anyne.,
"Amazon as the best prices for these, period. I used this card in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 8.0.  No issues!",
"I bought this card for my car's windshield mounted 1080P dash camera. When my cam arrived I just inserted a 16gb card that I had on hand. It is a 'type 6' and I didn't realize that it could degrade the cam's performance. After reading in an online forum that &#34;any video or photo application will benefit greatly from a 'type 10' memory card&#34;, I ordered the SanDisk 16gb Type 10 Micro SD card. Wow! what a difference! The stuttering video that I thought was just inherent to the camera itself is now gone. I believe the color rendition is better as well.This card was by far the best price of any supplier. It arrived quickly and solved a problem that I wasn't even sure I had.",
the micro sd works great as described. but beware that the micro sd adapters are faulty. the micro sd will get stuck in the adapter. you will have to carefully rip apart the adapter to get the micro sd out thus damaging the apapter.,
Got this along with SANOXY Micro USB OTG to USB 2.0 Adapter and Anker Uspeed USB 3.0 Card Reader 8-in-1. Works as described and I now have 64GB of extra space! I use this in my Transformer Infinity tablet as well for a total of 128GB of storage!,
"Using this as mass storage for my Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet 2. Have not done actual benchmarks, but I don't notice a difference between this and the on-board flash memory. I have my My Documents folder redirected to this card, and I have also installed several programs to it. All seem to operate acceptably.",
I bought this for my Samsung GS4 and it is working quite well. I have had it for several months without issues. I do not know how it performs vs what is advertised but for my purposes I don't care as much. It seems to load quickly on my phone as well as saving files.,
This speaker is great for the price. I love how the speaker is 360 degrees so you get the same sound in any part of the room.,
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
SanDisk never disappoints. As always SanDisk products are worth every penny. Nice product and quality and works great. I recommend this product to everyone.,
"I've always bought SanDisk SD cards, and have never been disappointed. This one is no exception. I'm using it in my Galaxy S III and have no problems. Transfer speeds are as advertised. Great card, great price.",
Best disk I have tried thus far for my gopro black. No problems what so ever in the snow or while in the extreme heat whit plenty of room for storage.,
"Perfect card, all you need to keep all the action in this 64gb. I acquired this card for a GoPro camera and fits perfectly, its all you need to capture all the action when you need it.",
"The product is OK, but my card does not acheive the rated write speed of 10 MB/sec.  Most applications probably don't need to hit 10 MB/sec, but my GoPro Hero 3 does need the full bandwidth and thus would bomb on me sometimes.  As tested, my card got between 8-10 MB/sec using the larger block sizes.  I complained to Sandisk about it and they allowed me to send it in for a replacement which I did (and took almost 2 weeks), but the replacement behaved the same way.  I would say this card is OK for most applications, but if you need top end speed, I would go with another card.  I bought my card in May 2013 and had it replaced in August 2013 so hopefully they have fixed this problem by now.",
"**Update 6.24.14**My 128 GB card stopped allowing writes via any of my card-readers on a Windows PC--either when it was inside any of several full-size SD card adapters (with the write-protect tab in either position) or plugged directly into the microSD slot of the reader.  MicroSD cards have no write-protect tab, so I was quite surprised and worried by this.  After failing to find any workable solution by searching online, I finally put it in my Chromebook and created a new folder on it there, then stuck it back in my Windows PC and it no longer gave me a write-protect error.  If anyone has a similar problem, I'd recommend doing something similar by putting it in any other PC, laptop, camera, etc you have available and try writing to it there.----------------------------------------------This portion of my review is necessarily being written as an update to my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, since Amazon disallows multiple reviews for what they consider the same item.  This portion concerns the 128 GB version of this card:I don't need a fast card, so the speeds on this card were not that important, besides which my test PC is not exactly high-end. Therefore I didn't count off for the speed results I got below, using a USB 2.0 card adapter, but I thought they might be relevant to some readers. While the card did reach the Class-10 and/or UHS-I requirements, it came in at under 2/3 of the claimed ""read speeds up to 30 MB/s for fast file transfer.""  Then again, running on a second PC using a different USB 2.0 card reader, none of the speeds even hit 5 MB/s, so this seems to be highly system-dependent.I only just got the card this week, and so far it works on *select* SDXC-compatible devices and exFAT-compatible operating systems:  some SDXC-compatible devices, such as the Panasonic HDC-TM40, do not allow cards larger than 64 GB (for whatever reason); this was stated in the manual, and I've confirmed this card is recognized as broken/corrupt/unusable in that device, whereas 64 GB exFAT cards work fine.  The 128 GB works fine (with original exFAT formatting) in my Toshiba Excite 7.7 Android tablet, and (predictably) not at all in my non-SDXC-compatible Galaxy Note 2 (though it possibly would if reformatted to FAT32, since a 64 GB card in FAT32 works fine there).I'll update my review to reflect any problems, issues, etc that I notice in the coming days & weeks.-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 (C) 2007-2013 hiyohiyoCrystal Dew World : [url removed as per Amazon rules]-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]Sequential Read : 18.694 MB/sSequential Write : 11.921 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 18.502 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 0.680 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) : 3.339 MB/s [ 815.1 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) : 1.581 MB/s [ 386.1 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) : 3.151 MB/s [ 769.4 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) : 1.564 MB/s [ 381.8 IOPS]Test : 1000 MB [G: 0.0% (0.0/119.1 GB)] (x5)Date : 2014/04/24 16:53:49OS : Windows XP Professional SP3 [5.1 Build 2600] (x86)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following is my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, published April 24, 2013:This is a high-quality card.  I've used it in a variety of devices, through multiple readers on different pcs, in an HD camcorder using a micro to full-sized SD adapter, and I've never once had a problem with it.  It even works at full capacity in *some* microSDHC-only devices once its reformatted to FAT32 (such as my SanDisk Clip+ FLAC player and supposedly even PSPs via a proper adapter, though I haven't yet tested my PSP).  I keep anticipating someone coming out with a card with equal or better capacity and speeds at a comparable price, but I haven't seen one yet.  If these were cheaper, I'd have several by now.Make sure your device can handle micro or full-sized SDXC cards, or is one of those rare gems that state they support only as high as SDHC but have been tested to work with SDXC cards such as this one once they've been manually reformatted to FAT32.",
"Let me guess: you love books, but you're not sure you want to get a kindle because you love the feel of books, rightI'm here to tell you that the kindle is the perfect balance of book and digital format.SHORT REVIEWYes, you should buy a kindle. Get the paperwhite with no ads. You're welcome.LONG REVIEWI love physical books too, I'm with you. But I know myself, and I know that once I forget to take the book I'm reading with me, that's it. I'll start another book and rarely finish the first. I also know if I try and read on my phone or iPad that I'll get distracted and start wondering about what's happening on the internet (Instagram's not gonna scroll ITSELF). Either way I'm not finishing the book.WHY KINDLEThe kindle takes the best of both worlds and mashes them together. The e ink display is honestly incredible. I wish iPhones had an e ink display. It really looks just like a printed page. So you get the experience of reading a physical paper book, but with the perks of being digital.Namely:- Share what book you're reading to Goodreads, Facebook, or twitter (so you can look SMORT)- Built in dictionary (so you can learn the proper spelling of the word SMORT)- Export your highlights as a PDFPlus, it'll also sync with the kindle app on your phone so you can squeeze in the final few pages of the chapter while you're in the bathroom (don't pretend you don't do that.

"The latest software update included hands free mode. So this can do everything that the stationary Echo speaker does, but is fully portable. Personally, I don't want the device to record everything I say all the time, so I only use the tap mode. The sound quality is good for a speaker of this size. This is especially a great choice if you have a mobile hotspot with unlimited data. You can now bring Alexa on the go.",
"When you buy a Micro SD card and you get a class 4, your apps will run slow and your camera will be slow. Spend the money on a class 10 for the speed of the card to ensure your device works up to its full potential. Listen to me, I am a certified Geek.",
"Since there are almost three thousands reviews already, I bet almost everything about reading and writing speeds have been covered. I'll just try to provide some specifics from my experience in case if somebody is searching with these keywords. I've copied some WAV and MP3 files to this card from a fast PC (3.4 GHz, 16GB RAM, 7,200 RPM HDD, 64-bit Win 7, etc.) with a built-in card reader. The card reader maybe my bottleneck. Anyway, the observed average writing speed was around 9.5MB/s.Tried this card in Nokia 3555b. Logically this phone cannot read more than 8GB MicroSDHC cards, but it it. However, it saw the card as being only a 2GB card. Tried inMotorola Flipout Unlocked GSM Quad-Band Android Phone with Bluetooth, Camera, QWERTY Keyboard and Wi-Fi - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black. Played those WAV and MP3 files and it worked very well. Tried inMotorola MB520 Bravo Unlocked Phone with Android OS, 3MP Camera, FM Radio and GPS - US Warranty - Blackwith the same files, and it worked well too. No hiccups. Then inserted (and left it in) inBLU Studio 5.3 II Unlocked Dual Sim Phone with Dual-Core 1GHz Processor, Android 4.1, 5.3-inch IPS Capacitive Touch, and 8MP Camera - U.S. Warranty (Black). So far so good. Will update this review if problems will arise.It was sold and fulfilled by Amazon in a frustration-free packaging. I love this packaging not only because it does not have nasty blister pack that cuts your fingers, but also because it is eco-friendly.",

"It blows my mind theres not a class action lawsuit against amazon for their crappy fire tv remotes. After mine died, like every other fire tv owner, i refused to buy the same crappy expensive remote only to have it die again. I found this cheaper option, it works just fine with the newer fire TV, it obviously doesnt have the alaxala voice command but i never used that anyway.",
This card is fast with no hang ups etc.  Price was very good.  I installed in my phone and have many pictures and a few videos on it so far.  Would buy this card again in a heart beat.,
I use this in my smartphone (Samsung). Push in in and go. No problem. Good price. Enjoying a lot more music now.,
"If you need a memory card, this one works as advertised... It is fast and reliable.  I have never had a problem with this brand.",

"Bought it, installed it in my Droid RazrM never removed it and it died at a little over 6 months now. Did not store apps or anything. just pictures and video from the phone.",
A great looking cover for the Echo Dot. It gives the Dot a softer and more elegant look. I feel that it is a little pricy for what you get but I do not regret my decision to buy this case.,
"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysOctober 11, 2013Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound, and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD. As you correctly point out, the new Kindle Fire HD is the successor to last year's entry level Kindle Fire, which does not include features such as camera, microphone, or HDMI port. You are also correct to point out that this device does not support Mayday, although there are still multiple ways to get help for free directly from your device. We hope you enjoy the new features and services. Thanks, The Kindle Team",

"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more",
I bought this card for my Samsung Galaxy phone. I have mounted the card and my apps are using it but I can't seem to get my photos to store there. It works just fine and gives me the added storage capacity I want I now need to figure out how to use it. This brand is really the only brand I would consider buying.,
"there is a lot of fake memory being sold right now, this is legit, works, and is the stated capacity. It benchmarked as fast as my device is (~10 mb/sec) This is my devices limitation not the cards I'm sure it is faster in devices that support higher speeds.",
"This card worked in my Galaxy S3 right off the bat.  I did not need to format it or anything.  After about 2 weeks, I was watching a video on my phone and it locked up.  Then the phone showed that the card was damaged.  Now I am unable to copy anything over 100mb to or from the card.  Viewing photos from the gallery also locks up the phone.  Amazon customer service is great, however.  They sent me a new card.  I will update my review after I am able to use the new one for at least a month without any errors.****UPDATE****After having the second card for a few weeks, it also had the same issues.  Even worse, the card was completely unreadable after it locked up.  The card showed about 5 GB of data being used, but could not be accessed via the phone or in a computer.  Sent this one back and will be going back to my trusty 16GB card.",
I mounted this in my S5 and it worked flawlessly from the start. Transfer speed are great using the S5's USB 3.0 capabilities.,
"Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version. For my 7 version review, please search for my HDX 7 review.My profile: Im a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do. It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more",
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
"I bought one of the first Paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and I suppose Ive read, on average, a book every three days for the past however many years on it. I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the Kindle.Of course, there are aspects of the Paperwhite which I would like to critique. Ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.As a member of BookBub, I get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. I take on many of them, however, Ive found that, even with the best will in the world, I cant keep up. Some days it seems that for every book I read, Ive bought two. Theres just so much good stuff out there! The accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my Paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. Its now at about 400.With this in mind, Ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the Kindle has become positively glacial. Not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. The general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a Kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. This drives me mad. Amazon states it can hold thousands of books. I believe them. But I figure I would need a second Paperwhite to read while Im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.Read more",

Q: What's the difference between a 19.99 Amazon 5W USB Official OEM Charger and Power Supply and a 5.95 5V 1A (1000mA) USB port power supply - UL ListedA: 14.04 Calling it a 5W charger rather than a 5V 1A charger is a distinction without a difference.,
"My previous kindle was a DX, this is my second kindle in years. Love the form factor and all but I do miss the physical buttons for page turning. There is a glitch in the software though.

Chose this over a regular Bluetooth speaker and am so glad I did. Alexa really helps me be hands free and get things done. The sound quality is great. I've used it in the bathroom and no issues with steam.,
I'm a nerd and a hoarder. I waited a year for more memory than 64gb. I wanted to carry my extensive digital comic collection on my tablet. No longer waiting. Happy nerd.,
"It's 64GB and it's in my phone.  Really, that's all you need for a review.  What more could you want?  I have all my music, several movies and I can record stuff on camera at full HD without worrying about running out of space.  No issues at all.  Did I mention it's 64GB?",
"Speaker is pretty loud and I love that I can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the ""home"" button to use Alexa",
Love it. It works great and is fairly cheap compared to other 64gb SD cards without sacrificing quality. SanDisk has always made great products.,
"I purposely waited almost 4 months before leaving a review. I wanted to see if any issues developed before leaving feedback. I was not disappointed. The refurbished fire arrived in perfect condition, no scratches or wear. I purchased a screen cover immediately to insure it would remain in good shape. After 4 months, it works like a champ. No issues whatsoever. VERY PLEASED and would not hesitate purchasing refurbished item again. Amazon has ALWAYS treated me superbly with any issues I might have with orders or returns.",

This is a great product! Would definitely recommend this item!,
"This speedy high capacity memory augmentation recalls more than my 27 years in school. Great price, excellent product. Expect no complaints from your purchase.",
Got this to go in my daughters Microsoft Surface RT and it is doing great! She loaded a movie on it and is happy her device has some extra memory :-),
The only thing is if you use this product on Andiod you must format .  Windows machines don't seem to supot FAT32  .  winwods machines will open files but the format program on Win only formats NTFS and EXFAT  which is limting because Andriod uses FAT32.,
"Bought two of these for me and my daughters Samsung Galaxy S3, and they store so much on them. I love my phone even more.",
"I purchased this memory card to use to expand the memory of my new Surface RT tablet. This memory card appealed to me first because I have always liked SanDisk products. Second, the price you this particular 64 GB card is a steal. The memory card includes both an adapter for the PC and a clear plastic case. Though I've only been using this card for a few weeks, I purchased a similar card earlier this year to use in my smartphone, and so far so good. I highly recommend this item if you need to expand the storage on your tablet.",
Can't beat the price on this one. 64GB and SD card reader. I use this is in my go Pro 3+ works fantastic.,
"Works in a HTC Rezound.  Was running short of space on a 64GB Sandisk so I ordered this when it came out, fast and no issues.",
pretty good! had a hiccup then they were pretty helpful and fixing the problem! used for my go pro and works freaking great!,
so fr it been great  i need it for my not 0. 2014 table  too bad it cost so much but  it is what it is,
"Have not had any issues, works as intended. I would recommend this and the price was just right. So, if you buy a tablet (that supports 32gb) just get one, or two.",
"What more can I say. They always work for me. At one time, they were more expensive than other brands. If you look for deals, that is no longer true.",
"I understood it did not have the wake command. But it would be better if it had it.Other than that, everything is wonderful with this speaker! Really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps, just ask Alexa and she plays the most recent episode!",
This card is of excellent quality and it does exactly what it should do.I use SanDisk almost exclusively and I've never been let down by one yet.,
I use this in my Go Pro. Never had an issue with it recording 1080p video it doesn't skip a beat.  It's hard to beat any of the prices on sd cards on amazon this is always the first place I check.,
Works fine with photo shooting and video recording in EOS camera with the SD adapter. Perfect for tablet and phone memory.,
"I use SanDisk SDHC cards in my Nikon cameras. I am using this one in a SANSA ZIP CLIP which is an MP3 player.  I am very happy.Cons:  none that I can think ofPros: Fast memory, small form factor, and excessively inexpensive ($18 for 32GB)",
"I have a GoPro 3 camera with which the cards (64Gb and 32Gb editions) work perfect.Formatting went perfect, movie recording and picture taking without any problem for the last 6 months now.However, I tried to use it in a Contour+ and the Contour GPS and both cameras are unable to use the cards, I presume these cards do not fit the Contour specifications (unable to format, no way to record on the card).So make sure the card is compatible for its intended use.",

Enough storage to my DSLR.Really low price for a Class 10 card.U can use several of this and make a Linux based SSD.,
Works as described.  I use it in my Samsung S5 and it was a plug and play.  Hope to have this phone until I am done with Cellphones they are getting to high priced.  everything was transfered from my old phone on to this and still have plenty of space left.,
I have 2.Phone for over a year and no problems.Use with adapter in camera and laptop for 4-5 months without any trouble.Will continue to use SanDisk,
It's a microSD chip. It's the storage amount I specified. It's sitting in the back of my Samsung Galaxy S3. It's nothing more than exactly what I asked for.,
"I purchased this for my grandson for his tablet. I actually purchased 2. He loves his games so I wanted to be sure he had plenty of space to save everything he wanted. They must be working, I've heard no complaints.",

"Over the years, I've found SanDisk memory to be durable and reliable. This 16 GB Class 10 card appears to be no exception. So far, it's performed well. I especially appreciate the fast write speed. For the money, it's a good deal.",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
I take my tablet to the gym in the morning and either watch movies stored on this card or stream Slingbox from the house. This allows me to store a lot of movies at one time. Works great.,
Look no further. Perfect for my galaxy devices. I purchased a few of these and switch them between devices for quick data transfer. Highly recommended.,
Didn't want to spend $200 on the Echo for someone who's not use to using a Bluetooth speaker. Great buy and functions well.,
"As soon as I got the card, I popped it into my phone and starting piling my music onto it, but then I noticed... 900 kb/s transfer speed?! I thought I got a class 10! Turns out, the device the card is mounted in has a factor on write speed. I plugged the card into the included SD card adapter and used a different reader and it was capping at 6 MB/s, so I'm pretty happy.One thing though; you don't get 32GB of usable space with this card, or any other card for that matter! You get around 29GB with this card in particular. It's normal, don't worry.",
"This was really worth the wait. I bought the Echo Show for my parents, who are elderly, and have a variety of ailments. Since they have arthritis, and a few other issues, I didn't want them to go and answer the doorbell, just to find it's someone soliciting them to buy random junk. So, last year, I bought and installed the Ring Doorbell Pro in their house, which works very well. The Ring Doorbell Pro is hardwired and not battery operated. After the skill was enabled, I could tell Alexa to show me the front doorbell and a video feed automatically pops up. You really need a good Wi-Fi router with the Echo show as the video will be jerky since the video is very high quality. If you have a good Wi-Fi router, the video comes up very quickly and runs very smooth. I thought the doorbell would launch the app on the Echo Show automatically, but it does not. You have to initiate the connection yourself. Hopefully this will be an option in the next iteration of this skill. I can think of a whole bunch of ideas for this skill to do, but for a very first implementation, it works great with the hardwired version of the Ring Doorbell Pro.The battery powered Ring products do not work as great though. When trying to connect the Echo Show to a battery powered Ring device, I get a message saying something like, The camera is asleep and needs to wake up and it could take 30 sec. This happens with my Ring Stickup Camera. So, if you want the best experience, you should buy the Ring Doorbell Pro instead of the battery powered versions.One of my parents just came out of the hospital and sometimes just doesn't have the energy to even pick up a cell phone when we call. So, we have another Echo Show, just for her, in drop in mode.Read more",
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",
I have it in my phone and it never skips a beat. File transfers are speedy and have not had any corruption issues or memory fade issues as I would expect from the Sandisk brand. Great card to own. Why entrust your precious files to a slightly cheaper piece of crap? If you lose everything can you forgive yourself for not spending the extra couple bucks on a trusted product that goes through good QA?,
Using it in my LG smartphone and they recommended this speed memory card.  So I ordered it and it booted and went into service with no problem.  No reason to think I will have a problem.,

"We already have an echo so I didn't think we needed the tap and procrastinated getting it. Now we use it everyday -- mostly to stream Amazon prime, TuneIn, or Pandora channels.It is funny how the latest technology sometimes brings us back to where we were when I was a kid -- having a ""beat box"" to carry around room to room and outside. We use the tap as a 2016 version of a ""beat box"" that is much smaller, rechargeable, and way easier to tune! And with side benefits of controlling our lights, HVAC, and with Alexa onboard ready to answer the random trivia questions.The sound quality could be a bit better, but surprisingly good. Adjusting the volume isn't as easy as it should be. The battery lasts a long time and its a snap to use a bluetooth speaker as well.",

"I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S3 because I could expand the memory, and this card is how I did it. The phone came with 16 Gb, and this cranked it up to 80 Gb for only about $65 more (buying this much memory already installed would have been much more expensive). I have about a half dozen albums, around 40 or 50 TV episodes, and maybe 16 full length movies on the card, with room to spare - very nice when sitting on a long plane ride! The only problem occurred the day after I put the card in - it gave me an error message, but when I removed and reseated the card, no problem, and none in the months since then.",
"What more can I say, open the box plug it in and it works !!!! Thats all you can say about this item.",
"It is exactly what it is advertised to be. Shipped fast, and I love the converter that comes with it so I can plug it into my computer.",
"Read the reviews and settled on this card to use in my cell phone.  So far so good.  No problems whatsoever.  Have tons of space to store all my mp3s, photos and videos.  Great read/access speed due to being HC-1 class.  Excellent price as I got this shortly after Black Friday sale.",
I use it in my Samsung Galaxy 3 cell phone and it works great.  Good value and quality. I highly recommend it.,
if you have a Microsoft Surface or phone that takes these.  I use it in my elago drive and Nikon DSLR.,
"needed more room on the phone and I picked this card up. Popped it in and let the phone format it, works just fine. Specs say that this phone max out with 32 GB card but that's just not true.  Really glad I got this card, it's fast so when I am taking photo's in burst mode it moves every one.... Not missing out on photo's due to a slow card.",
Love having someone to take notes for me and play music on demand.,
"I used this for a few months in my phone, then it decided to quit mounting. I lost some pictures of pets who died shortly after. I got a replacement card, but I had to send in the old one, giving up any chance of recovering its contents. The new one's worked fine, but failing after 3 months in inexcusable.",
"it has been awesome, and just enough in size. I have been putting movies in the range of 900mb to 3.5 gb. No issues. Also plays lossless music with no issues as well.",
This card is so small and yet holds this much storage. No problems with speed or reliability. Can definitely recommend.,
I bought this for my GoPro hero3 Black and it works flawlessly. When capturing in 1080p 60fps it has no problem keeping data and writing. Never had any errors or malfunctions. I've even captured using 4k and had no problems. For the people saying this doesn't work I'm guessing the problem isn't with the card but with either your GoPro or computer.Overall this card works perfectly and is much cheaper on Amazon. Don't bother buying in stores where they will charge you twice as much.,
Does what it is supposed to do. Performance is good and never seems to slow down the phone. Great product so far,
"We ordered these and used them in my Galaxy Note 2 and my wife's Razr M. After a few months we noticed that they would cause the phone to freeze up. The phones would start showing that it was mounting and unmounting the SD card early on but toward the end they just froze up the phone. Once we trashed the cards, the phones worked fine. We bought a different brand and no trouble since. I don't know why these red & gray ones have issues but stay away from them.",
"ok, i'm not going to lie, this thing as the fastest setup. i thought i was seeing things when i turned it on for the first time. apparently this device is connected to your amazon prime account so once you turn it on, it automatically literally goes straight to your prime account without signing in. i seriously had to call customer service because i was really creeped out on if i signed in or not. anyway, this thing is way better than the roku. though i do wish they had a iphone app for it because the remote is so small and i tend to lose it alot. its pretty much the same formate on the roku when it comes to Netflix and Hulu. it goes to the next episode atomically like samsung smart tv and the roku but i guess its a common thing but amazon prime you have to select the next episode itself. i seem to see this in a lot of other streaming devices.",
"Works, was priced right, has adaptor.Now I have to fill in more words to meet the minimum requirement. e",
I bought this micro SD card for my Samsung pocket camera.I was amazed at how much storage I could shoot video in HD 1080 on such a tiny card.So far it is performing  nicely.,
Great price and holds tons of stuff. The class 10 is way faster then any other card I have purchased,
"I purchased this primarily for use with the GoPro camera because it doesn't come with one. To my surprise, this mimi disc not only has high memory and speed; it also came with the full size adapter and all for a great price.",
"I like the case for the primary reason that I bought it--to protect my new kindle, but as a stand it has its drawbacks. I am not comfortable at all with trying to use it in the vertical position, and in the horizontal it is stable enough for watching movies or videos, but at home I have another stand that I use if I am playing any of my games on the tablet. Good price, and I am pleased with it as protection for my tablet. Not near as pleased with it as a viable stand.",
"Got this SD card for my Blackberry Z10, now I have 80gb of total storage! Try doing that iPhone5 lovers!",
"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
What can I say about it works as promised and just what I needed for my new cell phone  what more do you need,
I was not overly impressed with this system. I didn't realize you have to buy Amazon prime in order to use the functions. It didn't connect easily to my phone. It wouldn't just stream music saved on my iPhone. I had to download a music app and then load my music into the app. It wouldn't work. Way too much work and added expenses in order to use. Wasn't happy with that so I returned it and purchased a jbl portable Bluetooth speaker.,
I've been using this card for over 2 months and it works perfectly. I installed it in a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it was immediately recognized. No need for formatting or other special handling.,
"Got extremely solid speeds with it, no slack on my Android.  Solid Micro SD card with gigantic space.It works.  Awesomely.",
"The card does all it promises to do, but I have a gripe: the nail-ridge near the outer end of the card is not defined enough, which makes it rather difficult to extract the card from a reader or adapter.This is the first MicroSD card I have that has had this problem.",
"I've had this for about a week now and so far no problems. Due to my laziness, I didn't do a lot of research beforehand and didn't find out about the problem these cards had with the Galaxy S4, which is the phone I have, until after I had bought the card (apparently the cards kept unmounting themselves, even if you remounted it in the settings). Fortunately, SanDisk caught wind of the problem a couple months ago and fixed it, so kudos to them.",
i got this instead of the black one because it looked better built than the black one. i'm using it with a 8gb stanza sip clip. but the people at Sandisk said to use the black one instead,
The problem with rating and reviewing an item such as this one is.. does it work or not..  My experience with SanDisk memory cards has been they work and can take a beating.. and a washing...  what else can I ask for?,
"I use this memory card for my tablet that has many pictures and games and also my music, one can not go wrong with lots of music and this memory card really helps me keep it all.",
Just what I needed for more storage on my phone. Don't know why but I've always bought the SanDisk brand and always been happy with the product. I have a few of these in varying sizes.Deb,
bought for my go pro and i love how much info it can hold.. graet price couldn't go wrong.,
"Awesome SD card, awesome price, awesome speed, awesome quality, I really like this micro-sd card and hope it never fails.",
"Love Sandisk, never had a problem with them and still have not. Popped this into my Samsung Galaxy Relay 4g running Android 4.0.4 and the phone detected it without a problem. Has the write speeds expected and gets the job done. Would recommend a different card if you plan to go to 64gb, buy the Samsung UHS-1 SDXC, writes at much higher speeds and has less lag. Would buy this again for the cheap price, fifty elsewhere.Sincerely, iSklcndykid",
Excellent SD card and very good value. Have had no issues with mine or my wife's. Definitely recommend this SD card,
"Can't go wrong with SanDisk memory. Have bought these for phones, gaming and a GoPro.  Good capacity, convenient and durable.",
I use this in my dash cam and it has worked perfectly for months in the hot sun and freezing cold.,
Awesome card.. glad to be able to use it with my DSLR!,
"I got it from amazon for an amazing price of $17.99I bought one 64, and in total 3 32GB cardsThey work great on my gopro Hero 3 - and they are the main recommended one there.with the adapter I also can use them on my Nikon D800E and I am getting 19 Pictures in Burst mode until the camera slows down when I am shooting in raw full speed - after that it takes about a minute till i can do it again - but we are talking about 900MB pictures to save.... or what do I need USB sticks? - this is smaller and faster!",
"Still working fine in my Galaxy SII.  No complaints.  I do have a complaint about my Galaxy occasionally erasing everything on it, but I'm sure that's not the card's fault.",
No issues with this. Formatted the cards I reviewed from Amazon. Put them in the devices and they're running great.,
"This is the fastest SD card i ever own, 30mb/s i recorded full HD videos... And this card help me a lot with it.",
Works as it should and have not had any issues with it so far. I also was able to purchase it here for much less then Wal-Mart.,
"I have purchased several Amazon Fire cases in the past and have been delighted in the streamlined design and the vinyl covering. Very easy to keep clean. This new design for the fire HD 8 is FABRIC. How long do you imagine a yellow fabric cover is going to stay clean I cannot see any easy way to clean it, like I do with the vinyl covers. I bought one for myself as well as my Mother. I will keep them but I sure hope they don't turn around and produce vinyl ones after all the concerns I am sure will be coming. I won't be able to afford two more.",
"is very good micro sd , i use with my samsung galazy s 4 and work perfectly , have more space to my music",
"I started useing it the minute I got it, transferred 30g from my old SD card to the new 64g Micro Card with no problem.  Arrived on time and packaged well.",
I went from 2g to this 32g card and really love it. The price is WAY lower than the Verizon stores. You will NOT have storage issues after popping this in your phone.,
"I'm a light user. I don't store a lot of media on my phone, and don't play a lot of games or watch a lot videos. I keep my media on here (music, photos, docs, etc), and backups. I don't notice much of a lag. Any lag I do notice (maybe every couple of months) I attribute to the phone, not the card. A shutdown and re-start usually solves that. Great to have, and way more space than I'll ever use. If you're not a heavy user, you may not need this much storage space, but for about $20, why not just get it and know you'll never run out of space.",
"Using it on my Galaxy s3, and it just worked out of the box.No problems whatsoever, was instantly detected and ready to go.",
I bought this micro SDHC card for my Nook HD+ device because I was going to install N2A and it worked perfectly.,
"This card was great! I originally bought it because it was cheap for being a class 10 card and having 32GB of storage. No problems so far.Pros:Cheap, most other cards would cost a lot moreClass 10, 32GBFastWorks on smartphoneCon:None so far",
Does as it is supposed to.,
Works just fine installed on my new MS Surface Pro...too bad Windows 8 user experience is lacking! Delivered and works as expected from SanDisk.,
"We got this the day it came out. I have a four year old daughter, and she loves it! We have an iPad for her, but it was getting very expensive because so many of the games have buttons that you can click which then tell you about things you need to buy and she would have to have them. This tablet restricts all in app purchasing. Yay! We tried the older version of this tablet but it kept freezing and did not perform well. But so far, this one works well. I have two requests to Amazon, and I am hoping that someone from Amazon reads my review so they can make this change. Please change Amazon Freetime so that it puts the story apps that are under apps into the books sections. There are many wonderful stories that are read out loud but they are in the apps section instead of the books section, so then when I restrict her tablet to books only, she can't access them. I would love it so much if you they would fix this. A few examples of the stories she can't access when I restrict her to books because they are considers apps are the following: Nighty Night!, Charlie Brown's, The Berenstain Bears, and Dino-Store Story. The other recommendation I have is to please hide from view the activities that are restricted. As it is now, she can see all the apps but gets an error message when she selects them. I really like this product, and I think it so great for children. It just needs a few little improvements to the Freetime interface.",
"i bought this sandisk ultra 32 gb micro SDHC memory card for my go pro hero white edition, is really good anD works perfecly, try it, you wont regret!!",

this item came on time nice works well  they want 12 more words i just dont have then . .,
"Works Great!  I was running out of room on my 32GB card on my Galaxy Note 3.  This solved my problems nicely!  Now I have enough space for movies, music and photos on my device!  I don't think I will be running out of space for a while!",

"Since other people have gone into detail on the device, I will answer only the burning questions I had before I received mine. I was very happy with my Paperwhite and would not have bought this had mine not been stolen/lost (not sure which). My husband still has his Paperwhite, so I was able to compare them side by side.CAN I USE THE WALL CHARGER FROM MY PAPERWHITE TO CHARGE THE VOYAGEYes.CAN PRESSING THE PAGE TURNERS CAUSE REPETITIVE USE ISSUESI don't think so. You can turn down the pressure it needs (which is very slight) or you can turn it off completely and turn pages with a tap. It's actually nice to have both options.CAN YOU SEE WHERE TO TURN THE PAGES IN THE DARKNo. You can guess where the page forward area is, but the page back is a dot, so guessing would be difficult. But you can still tap to turn pages. Using a cover helps, as the edge of the cover would be right over the dot.DOES THE FEEDBACK BUZZ ANNOY YOU WHEN YOU TURN PAGESI think it does take a little getting used to, but you can turn it down, and I think I will not notice it after a while. (There's no sound it's purely tactile.) Months later: It's not distracting you forget about it.IS THE ADJUSTABLE LIGHT NICEI still do it manually. It doesn't adjust the way I'd like it to. Not as bright in good light as I'd like, and not as dim while my husband is sleeping next to me. Note that if you want to use the night light, you have to set that separately from Auto Adjust. Settings/Device Options/Screen Light. I'm not actually sure that the night light is working. It was at 18 when I turned off the light (this is quite bright), and I checked it about 10 minutes later, and it was at 17.Read more",
"Still don't feel is very fast or is just my phone, I guess I will need to remove it and run some R/W tests. Still Its ok.",
"We can't beat Class 10 flash memory speeds, at least for now.  This unit works assuringly F A S T and reliably ... for a reasonable price, too.  I have no hesitation in recommending it ... or buying the SanDisk brand, again.",
Works great! My tablet loves it. I always buy SanDisk products and have never had a problem with any of them.,
"I couldn't decide on which one to buy. They all do the same things, but ended up buying the tap which is portable. I take it on my deck with a cup of coffee and listen to the music I put in through pandora and iheart radio. I absolutely love it, and so does my husband.",
Love the micro sd card. It's everything i wanted and needed. The packaging was hassle free and easy to open,
"My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new friend named Alexa!

Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.Happy HolidaysRoy",
This Micro SD card works great in my Hero 3 Black edition. I have never had any problems with any SanDisk product that I have owned.,
"fast card., and so far, reliable. Reformatted to NTFS with no problem. No problems in a Dell Venue 8 pro.",
Got this for my new Galaxy S3. It works great. Tripled my memory and it's compatible! Worth every cent to be able to carry a TON of music and podcasts.,
"This was a good investment for my galaxy note 2, i had to use the perseus kernel to swap the internal memory with this little guy, so right now, my phone reports internal memory of 59GB, so that's great. It's good saving pictures, full hd videos, games, etc.",
"SanDisk makes quality products and you can count on them at a small price than the competition. Again, why pay more for the same thing when this fits the bill for your needs. Save your extra money or give it to a needy family member....We recommend this product with an A+ rating.",
It went into my phone and stores my pictures well.  I just take it out and plug it into my laptop and transfer pictures.,
works well in my Samsung S5 no issue,
"Not much to say, its a memory card but it works great in my Go Pro Hero 3 Silver Edition.  Using 960x60, this card gave me 8.5 hrs of video recording time.  Definitely a good buy",
Does a good job at a nice price. I like this. It came on time and fits well in my Dell Venue Pro,
"There's not a lot one can say about a micro SD card. This one has this cool red stripe on it. It's Class 10, making it fast. It works. 'Nuff said.My application was for mounting in a Microsoft Surface RT tablet. I encrypted it with BitLocker to be safe. No problems.",
Added additional storage on my Surface Tablet.  It allows me the storage of items that I want or need to transport to other devices.,
"this class 10 Micro SD card has worked flawlessly,  the adapter has also worked well, but the parts are so small it can sometimes be hard to handle.  worked great overall.  good performance.",
"use it with my GS4,,no data corrupt/loss issues encountered. Also being Class 10 it holds true to speed claims.would highly recommend.",
This is a terrific memory card! I use it with my go pro to capture 1080 video and its got ALOT of space!,
"Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version.

Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added.

"Works amazingly in my Nokia Lumia 2520. Highly suggest this item and distributor to everyone, fast service.",
Needed to update the card in my Galaxy S4. Bought this one on sale. Installed it and it works fine. Loaded it up with music and have also used it for storing photos and videos from the phone. Big fan of SanDisk products.,
"Although it may be overkill for the application, considering its capacity, this appears to work very well for firmware memory for the Raspberry Pi, and at the price I bought it for on last year's Cyber-Monday, I wish I could buy a few more of them for the same price.  I haven't tried it with the RPi overclocked, but it's worked without a glitch at the normal RPi clock rate.  I've also used the 32GB version of this in my music player, and it has worked well also.",
"I had to return this and get another one, as the first was faulty. I hear this is semi-common.Must not have enough testing, i might suggest buying two and returning one if you are in desperate or sudden need of one of these chips, no matter what size.",
"Is just what it says it is.  Works great and holds a ton of photos in our camera.  Haven't had any issues with it, but I'm not a techy so can't really compare it to other brands.",
I can't believe 32gb fits in such a small space. It blows my mind. My first computer only had half a gb for a hard drive and was the size of a book. What is this sorcery!?!,
"Had a 16GB card in my S4 and my wife didn't have a memory card in her S3, so I bought a couple of these for us. I needed a bigger card because I load custom ROMs and such and she needed one for her media. They work great and have a pretty nice capacity!",
I have used this with Sony camcorder for more than a year now. It works well and copes with the high data volume of a camcorder video.,
"Decent storage, used on my GoPro Hero Camera. Windows XP doesn't recognise card and infomation. Would definately buy again, if needed.",

"If you like the Amazon Echo and want it to be portable, this is the solution. The stereo speaker sounds good for how small it is. The built in Alexa functionality makes it a better choice than other similar sized (and priced) portable speakers.",

"Great storage for my android phone, practically unlimited space for music.  Easy to install, and it has been reliable so far.",
"For $20 I can't complain about those speeds too much.  I put this little guy into a super mini MicroSD reader to stick into my truck stereo for MP3 storage.  I use a USB3 memory card reader to populate the card with music, and my truck stereo seems happy with it.",
"I only purchased this because I loved the sound quality. Alexa is just a added bonus personally as I rarely hit the ""tap"" button to ask her anything. The few times I asked her questions, she hasn't disappointed. EXTRA: Now what would make this device amazing is if Alexa was able to connect to my Apple Music playlist! If only...",
"The Tap is essentially a smaller version of the Echo that has Alexa capability like Echo does, but also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker. You do need to tap it to ask Alexa to do anything, but otherwise it works the same as Echo. I prefer the Echo, but the Tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their Echo.",
the packaging opens very easy and the micro sd card works flawlessly in my razor maxx hd and asus transformer.,
The internal memory on my ASUS tablet is kinda slow.  I installed this bad boy into my tablet and install the OS onto it.  Now the tablet runs nice and fast!,
"I bought this card, originally for my Galaxy Note II, with the intentions of using it as my primary downloader, but I could not get it to format correctly for the phone, even using third party format software.I then tried it in my Galaxy Tab2 7.0plus......same problems.I finally, and ridiculously, put the card in my Nikon D5100 camera. I could take a whopping 8k photos, on high/large settings (not that I would ever need to take that many photos in one session). This was the last option I had, to use the card.It worked well, taking photos of a holiday, and thankfully, it did not fail before I could get my photos onto a computer. Since then, I have inserted it back in the camera, and reformatted (like you always should), and bam, one photo is good, after that, failure, every single time. So now I have a 64GB card, that is capable of taking and storing ONE PHOTO at a time, before I must run a ""fix file system"" on my computer.Don't waste your money on this card, over priced, not really faster than the other cards I have, and zero longevity. This may be a one off, but I think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exFAT, that makes this card a loser, or more to the point, the poor customer who buys it.UPDATE JULY 2012After contacting sandisk, they have offered an RMA, but first they must verify that I have not tried to ""recover"" or ""wipe"" the data on the card, and I must ship it, at my expense, to Taiwan. I have since emailed them in reply to the requested information (date of purchase, photos of the card, packaging ect), and I told them that the data on their is my data, and if I could have accessed the card, I would have wiped it, why should I give them my information, stored on the card? That makes me less than happy, I am guessing that they want to discourage returns. Who would want to send data to a company, not knowing who will access it, and what they will do with the information contained? I would have wiped the card, but it was unreadable, unable to format, unable to do anything. I will send it to them, hoping that the information is destroyed, along with the bad card.Sandisk, you are asking a whole lot of your customers, and since this card has gone bad, I have had several other cards from them, go bad as well, seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods. I used to love their products, and their older flash drives are great, still using a micro cruzer that is 6 years old, and going strong. I have not had one single microSD card, from this company, last more than three months, since I moved to the Philippines. Either they send their junk to the Philippines, or they have dropped QC from their business model, to create higher profit margins.**UPDATE 2**After emailing Sandisk, and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item, intact, so that they can ""assess"" the card, and look at/recover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card, they rescinded. I can only assume that they want to get the card back, to verify that it is bad, or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them, which I can understand. Instead of requiring me to send the card back to them, they asked that I cut the card, and send a photo of the ""destroyed"" card, so they could process a new card, to be sent to me, directly in the Philippines. I hammered them pretty hard in this review, and in the email I sent to them, regarding the bad card, and sometimes, you get results, in this case, I give them 5 stars for doing the right thing. I had no problem cutting the card, since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway, but I did have a problem returning the device, intact, with out knowing what information was stored on the card (banking, amazon account info, passwords, ect.) I would have just kept the card, destroyed it, and never bought another from sandisk. With their faith restoring gesture, I will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid. I just hope that they get better at QC. I returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday, only to find out that you MUST have the original packaging for a replacement. I was lucky to still have one of my packages, but since I bought several of the cards, I am not sure if I gave them the matching package for the card I returned.I would suggest that if you are like me, and have several devices (2 DSLR's, galaxy Tab2, galaxy Note 2, SII, LG-P920), that you find a way to mark each card/package, and keep the package, in the case that the card should go bad. I have had more than half of my sandisk 32gb cards, fail on me, in less than 6 months. I only buy them, because of the cards available in my area, these are the best, which is scary, with such a high failure rate.",
"stored over 2000 pics in good quality and were transferred to laptop from tablet, very happy with San Disk Ultra",
"I use this in my Samsung Galaxy S3. It's spacious and holds a large chunk of my music library, so I'm happy. Haven't had any stability problems, and it seems to be reasonably fast for my purposes. No complaints.",
"im so upset right now it just died , turned on my phone and all my movies pics music all gone. card just died after three months bullcrap.",
Love the tap. The speaker is nice. Likenit has a charging cradle it can sit on. Easy charge.,
"I bought the 32gb version here for my Samsung Proclaim android phone (Straight Talk Wireless model). Removed my current 4gb card from the phone, put it in one card reader in my Mac, then put the new 32gb card in another card reader in my Mac, copied all phone files over to the new card (saving the old 4gb as a backup for now). (Note: I did not have to do any formatting of the new card to read it on the Mac or in the phone.) Inserted 32gb in my phone, booted it up and have had no problems in first hour of use. Will update if I notice overheating, card failure, etc. as reported by a few others here. I'm showing about 29.3 gb of available storage on the card as received from Amazon (before copying my files to it).",
I have seen and purchased these at lower prices so I was disappointed on the cost but I needed them pretty quickly and I knew Sandisc's are good SD cards.,
"Works on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3, but I don't really stress these kinds of things.  I have had no problems.  Have not checked it for heat or any such thing.",
"I'm still stuck 10 years ago when microSD cards were fairly new. They were and still are neat - its amazing at how much you can put on something that is literally the size of a fingernail! I purchased this Class 10 64Gig exclusively for use with myGoPro HERO3: Black Editionso that the card can keep up when the camera is recording HD at 60fps. Its amazing how many people aren't aware of the classes of these data cards and how it can affect performance and capturing of video and even stills. If you have tried capturing video only for it to shut off automatically, it may be because your memory isn't fast enough to keep up. But you'll have no problems keeping up with this card nor should you have problems storing it all! This SanDisk memory often gets labeled ""the best of the cheap memory"" but I'm unsure how the expensive, poor memory does - why would anyone buy anything else more expensive?! This is the card to get! It's so good, I've also purchase two 32Gig cards for our Samsung S4's!",
Just what I needed for my digital music collection on my phone.,
"Not really much to comment on as I have had good experiences with SanDisk Ultra in the past. They are a little more pricey than some of the other brands but only by a couple bucks. What you get is &#34;no surprises&#34;. They pop into your phone, camera, tablet and basically work forever. I don't run speed tests so can't comment on whether they are plus / minus milliseconds faster than another brand (a millisecond here or there really is not a big deal to me). I've never had a failure with a SanDisk product (or Kingston, another good value).I used it for awhile in my Asus Tablet but currently it has been moved over to my Droid. Works as advertised a was an excellent value.",
"This worked great in my Samsung Galaxy S4 - plenty of storage for photos, video, and I'm not sure what else to use it for yet.",
"I was really looking forward to using what was hyped as an amazing piece of entertainment equipment, but the actual experience falls short.Pros:+ User interface and underlying hardware is fast+ Form factor of the device and remote control is very sleek+ Plays games fairly well, especially for such a small box+ Quality of Amazon videos is very good+ Voice search works quite well+ The device came pre-configured for my Amazon account. I just plugged it in, updated the software, and away I wentCons:- First and foremost, there is STILL no way to search for only free movies on Prime.- Amazon touts it's 40,000 Prime movies available, but good luck finding them. There is no categorization by genre. You are stuck surfing through dumb lists of movies, or using the search function, which almost never returns any Prime movies- Voice search works only on Amazon content. You cannot use this to search within Netflix, for example- The Amazon FireTV box only comes with 8GB of memory for game and app storage, which is completely inadequate. There are games available for download that consume almost 2GB for ONE GAME. Good luck downloading a 1.76GB game, like the racing game featured in the list of top games.Clearly, Amazon is marketing this device as a way to push its video content. In the help video that automatically plays the first time you use the device, it even offers you a 30 day Prime membership for free to try it out. However, Amazon has no incentive to help you actually search for and find this free content. It's clearly evident in the lack of ability to filter search results on free Prime content only. This is my biggest beef with Amazon, by far. I want a Netflix-like experience, where my Prime content is sorted by genre, and I can search for free movies only. Now, if you want to pay for video rentals, by all means buy this device, because it works really well. If you want it to access your Prime content only, stick to the Roku box you probably already have, because it works just as good.UPDATE:I called customer service, and talked to a guy about how I can search for and access my 40,000 Prime movies. Well....YOU CAN'T According to him, I can only find the Prime movies on the two lists on FireTV that say Recently added to Prime and Top Prime Movies. Those lists are 73 items, and 150 items, respectively. THERE IS NO WAY TO SEARCH OR BROWSE FREE PRIME CONTENT ONLY. The guy I talked to said this was a very common request for people. OF COURSE IT IS. I don't want to pay for video rentals if I just paid for a Prime membership to access free content. AMAZON COMPLETELY FAILED. I AM RETURNING THE FIRE TV.",
"I currently own the original echo which is in my living room, a dot in my bedroom, and one at work. I have lights, fans, a thermostat, surround sound, and TV all connected to my Alexa devices. Of course I had to buy one with a screen. I'm a big fan of Alexa, the products have become a routine part of my day. As soon as the Show was available to preorder I ordered one without any hesitation.Initially I wanted to put my show on a 70 inch TV stand by my 60 inch TV where my original Echo was. I figured it wouldn't look bad because I could use it as a digital picture frame also. I don't have end tables and quickly came to the realization that viewing a 7 inch screen from 8 feet away wasn't going to work for me. My Show now sits on my kitchen counter. I figured I'd get more use out of it in my living room because most of my Alexa enabled devices are in there and generally I spend more time in my living room than the kitchen.The problem with displaying the show on a kitchen counter is that the screen can only be seen from straight on if you have a larger kitchen, so if you aren't standing directly in front of it, it's hard to view the screen. You will have to turn it in a direction that it would be facing you.As far as I can tell you can not cut the screen off completely, which would make this a bad fit for a bedroom. The clock displays in white with the screen in a dim black by using the command turn off the screen. *Update* The screen can be cut off.This device was marketed as a hands free companion in the kitchen for things like recipes. My frustration is when I ask it to pull up a recipe it's inconsistent. Sometimes it wants to send the recipe to my phone, sometimes it wants me to swipe down on the screen to access the cooking directions and ingredients.Read more",
I wanted the technology but didn't want something that listens to the ever-present conversation in my home. The Amazon Tap fit the bill since one must tap its button to get it to listen.It works and works very well.,
"I got it for my Galaxy S4 and it works well. It has a good speed and good space which is something I definitely needed. Sometimes it has a hard time getting recognized in my computer, but I always find a way to make it work. It will not do NTFS, but its not necessary for my purposes.",
Much cheaper than in the store and is just as described in the listing. I like it and would order again. Perfect fit,
"Look how many highly positive reviews this card has; just get this one. It is huge, it is fast and reasonably priced for a such a high-speed chip.BTW, this comes with the filesystem formatted to exFAT.  Depending on your device, it may not like that and you need to format it to FAT32.  The problem is that Windows does not support formatting FAT32 filesystems above 32GB.  So you can format this as FAT32 under Linux or use this tool in Windows [...]",
"We have been using Echo since April 2015. Prior to that time, my husband had been hospitalized for several weeks. He is currently wheelchair bound. We immediately installed the Hue bridge and lights as well as the WEMO outlet. With these, and dear, dear, Alexa, he has a great deal of control of his environment in ways that make him much more independent. Others might enjoy Echo for fun and convenience, but for him it is a lifeline! He has even had her turn the lights on in my bedroom when I didn't hear him call.We use the shopping list feature a lot, and my husband has added things to the list that he remembered, while I was already at the store. Should I mention he adds things like chocolate bars when I'm not looking No more paper lists! I just look at the app on my phone and things disappear as I check them off.We transport Echo from the living room to the bedroom, since it is easier for him not to have to use the remote, plus it is always there for his favorite music, an update on news, and to check the weather. Or, when he needs cheering up, I ask for a joke. Tosave plugging in behind his lift chairs, I have ordered a second plug. I love the easy reconnect to the WIFI.I was a bit worried at first about his word slurring with his Parkinson's, but it has worked the opposite way! I notice he focuses his words much better while giving commands. After he forgot her name early on, we added it so he could remember using the Zink hAppy App.My granddaughter was happy to check her math problems using Echo, and in addition to the music stations and Amazon play lists, Echo is a breeze to use as a Bluetooth device. I have used it to play my meditation apps and iTunes music.Read more",
"Ive had the card for over a month, using it in my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.I filled the card with a few TV shows and movies to watch on the go, as well as many PDFs and MS Word Docs.The MS Word and PDF files often get corrupted after use. THe larger files seem to stay intact. I moved the smaller files into the internal storage and havent had problem since.Im hoping Sandisk has a decent return policy.",
"I ordered this card as part of a lighning deal back in November. The card was working fine in my galaxy s3 until a few weeks ago where it would intermittently not be recognized by my phone or my desktop computer and today, 4 months later, it died completely. I guess you really do get what you pay for.",
"June 18 is not only the Father's Day but also my older daughter's birthday. She turns 6 years old this year and we thought that tablet would be a nice birthday gift for her. Her younger sister has Fire 7, so it was logical for us to buy Fire 8 for her, as she's older.We bought this tablet for her more with an educational purpose, than to watch cartoons. My husband is a software engineer and he really wants our daughter to learn how to code. There are so many different apps for that.We have already tested it today, when the tablet arrived, but haven't shown it to our daughter yet.There are three different colors and we chose the blue one, as it's her favorite color. It's very bright, the case looks like removable foam shell, very sturdy and easy to grab. It's actually a very nice decision of adding yellow color because when brother and sister share one device, it's better to go neutral.There is a possibility to expand storage up to 256 Gb, but I think 32 Gb on board will be more than enough for my daughter.Big cutouts make it easier to access to the volume and power buttons, as well as the charging port and headphone jack.The display is ok for the price. When I watched Peppa Pig, images looked sharp and colors were vibrant, even at extreme angles. The sound is much better here than in Fire 7 Kids Edition, and that's due to dual stereo speakers.I don't know how easy and intuitive the interface will be for our daughter, but for us it was great, nothing odd or unnecessary. My favorite option is Parent Control. I can password-protect purchases (including in-app purchases), Wi-Fi access and more.Read more",
I have the kindle fire but was frustrated when taking it to the beach. This model is easy to read on the beach and was easy to set up. You can't tell that it's refurbished - it looks brand new.,
It's small and I don't miss voice interface. This is a 2nd one because my significant other and I like our own remotes.What I wasn't sure about was if the Amazon Fire TV would support more than one remote. But it does! You just have to register it with the Amazon Fire TV's device settings.,
"16gb is a good amount for what I use it for and SanDisk is #1 fir sd cards, I'm satisfied.",
-Great storage-Low price-Good transfer rate-Respond and read time is good-almost 14.8 will be available for user usage,
I just got a Note 3 and while 32gb is great...who wouldn't want another 64gb?  This SD card does what I want it to do and I'm happy with it.,
"This card is used for my Samsung Galaxy S3 on AT&T and it works great!  Read and write speeds are pretty good, and the card installed and was recognized by the phone very easily.  Great option if you need more storage on your mobile device!",
"I'm not sure what else to say other than, &#34;it works&#34;.  I use this card with my Sandisk Wireless Flash.....I think I'll buy a couple more.",
"UPDATE:This card stopped working as of late February 2013, after only about 2 months of regular use.  There are 492 similar complaints about this card (now 493...) and this is 17.5% of 1 star out of 2918 reviews...  At first I thought it was my phone not being able to find it, or the card would often spontaneously dismount, and there were the frequent and repeated alerts for me to format the card.  Formatting the card only cured the problem for a day or two...  Plugged it into the desktop directly, and the same thing happened.  Got another card of another brand, and everything has been working well since early March 2013 with the other card. So it was not the phone but the card that is at fault.  Very poor longevity. The price is right, but at the end not worth it if you need to buy another card to replace it.  Amazon only covers 30 days..., so consider this a very expensive 60 day experiment if you are willing to try this brand of card...  Would NOT recommend.",
"I am using this 64 GB card onSamsung Galaxy Note II N7100 Unlocked GSM International Version White. I coped over 50 GB podcasts/music. It took several hours to copy from a 3 year old laptop. After copying, the inbuild Samsung's music player recognized all and playing is very smooth. The card looks super fast, no reading. After booting the phone, the music is indexed almost immediately and I can play. I have attached a screenshot which shows only 59+ GB is available. The 5 GB seems lot to be missing. I am assuming it is used for storing some index information/some restore information.",
"This new KFHD replaces last year's basic Kindle Fire. Although it has some cool new features, it lacks a camera, microphone, and HDMI port. For this reason, I'm glad I kept my 2012 model since it does have these 3 features! Here are my initial impressions of the 2013 Kindle Fire HD: I like the placement of the on/off volume buttons. Being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one. I never cared for the carousel (this is what you see when you turn your Kindle on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed), and now there's an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead, and the apps/books can be rearranged to your liking. I was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar (which is now being called home). I don't know why Amazon removed this option, and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel. But you can still bookmark your favorite web pages YouTube videos for easy access. When I play songs purchased from Amazon's MP 3 store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style. Nice feature, but it doesn't work on every song. This device has a cool new feature called Quick Switch, which allows us, when reading or using an app, to bring up recently accessed items with a swipe instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one.In terms of sound, I find it to be tinny and not as rich as it is on the original KFHD. But you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds. Ironically, music sounds muffled unless you hold the device in landscape mode with your hands covering the speakers. Holding it this way projects the sound out to you.Read more",
Good card for the price.  Lots of room for music  Plays in the Sansa MP3 without any difficulty or trouble,
"Used it in several camera models (D800, Nex-5N and HDR-AS15) all worked great with no issues. I am definitely thinking about getting a few more of these since Amazon has an unbeatable price.",
No Samsung Galaxy S3 should be without one!  This should last me until 128 or 256 GB models become available. :)Does NOT fit the iPhone!  No iPhone can accept Micro SD memory upgrades.  Buy a Samsung phone instead!,
Bought this for use in my dash camera upgrade.Working very well and faster than the 4 GB card that came with the camera.  Also will work in my other digital cameras.,
I ended up with two of these after mistakenly purchasing the regular sized SD cards for Hikvision security cameras only to find that they needed the micro SD cards instead.  They installed and formatted with no issues and are working well in the cameras.The best thing about Sandisk is that they have a lifetime warranty with these cards unlike some of the other brands.I purchased these for 45 dollars each and are reasonably priced around that.,
I bought this item and at first the card was defective however a quick online chat with sandisk and two weeks later I had a new working device. Not much to say other than a Great product and company. Definitely recommend.,
I couldn't ask for anything better. I use it in my GoPro Hero 3. Records a lot of video and holds a lot of pics.,
"I'm running a live Linux system off of this card right now, via a USB port.  Seems to have good read/write speeds and is durable.",
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
"All though it states 16gig it only has 14.8gig available but I know that happens and expected it, keep this in mind if your wanting more storage you might want to order the 32gig card.  It was exactly what i expected and needed so no complaints.",
It came in a reasonable amount of time and was exactly as I ordered. No pretty lights and no stunning sound. Just a reliable memory card that worked and has not failed.,
"its a memory card and has the reputation you expect from SanDisk. I thankfully didn't get a knock off, counterfeit, card because It was bought official threw Amazon. it works as advertized and at full capacity (59~ gigs after formatting, which is to be expected) it has good speed for things like games movies music and photos (view/shooting) I've owned it for about two weeks now and its been reliable giving me no reason to doubt it.if you have a low capacity phone/tablet/device you should buy a card and SanDisk is probably the brand you should go with. the price is rite (through Amazon) and they are backed by both the manufacturer and the distributor with a warranty (Amazon A-Z 30 day, and SanDisk- 6mo parts I think it is) its better than you can get with budget or discount cards you find elsewhere.I recommend this product to customers looking for quality storage space.",
This product met my expectations.  It was easy to install and works as you would expect it to.  Shipping was fast as usual.,
"great and holds more than anticipated, just love it.  My granddaughter loves it because she can put all of her music on it",
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase",
"I already have 2 Roku devices, but thought I would give this new Amazon device a try. This device works fine for the Amazon Instant video app, but there is a terrible lag in the video on the Netflix app that makes it unusable on this device. I know this issue is not my internet connection as the Netflix app works great on the Roku devices. In addition, the user interface on this device is generally just not that great. Wish I could get a refund and get another roku box.",
"I got this product exactly 1 month and 3 days ago. Prior to today, it was working fine. Out of nowhere, my Micro SD card can't be read anymore. I've tried several phones, and 3 different laptops (both OSX and Windows 7), and it doesn't even show up anymore. Be weary of the product. You may end up with a lemon.",
"Figured there was not going to be any issues with SanDisk; produce arrived in well packaged - removed it, formatted it on computer, and installed. Working fine!",
Bought it for my Surface Pro. I've had it in there for a few months and I've had no problems. Very fast and stable.,
Got this for my phone and it is really great. It holds everything that I want to put on it.,
"I put this micro-SD card in my Note II phone, and I have had a seamless experience with it.  Programs that are on the card operate as quickly and flawlessly as those that are on my phone's memory.  It will hold dozens of programs, and gives me all the expandibility that I will need (unless I start collecting HD movies on my phone!).  This card seems to be designed specifically for smartphones, and does its job very well.  Recommended.",
I got this for my phone and it is working well as storage for my music and images.  I would order this again if I needed another.,
I bought this MicroSDXC card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition and it works great.  The transfer speeds on it are excellent.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend.,
"Got it on sale for an incredible price.  The only way I am likely to upgrade from this is if they come out with a 128g size.  64g is not necessary for my use, but at 128 I would be able to use it without worry of running out of space /and/ put my entire mp3 catalog on it as well.Update - about 4 months after I bought this and installed it in my Galaxy S2, it started causing some trouble for my phone.  At first I did not realize it was the micro sd card causing the problem, but it would occasionally have a status message saying something like ""Unmount the SD card before removing it to avoid corrupting your data"", and eventually it didn't even recognize that there was a card in there at all.  I put the old 1gb card back in and it works fine.  Put the 32gb card into the adapter, and put it into the computer's card reader... Nothing.  Wouldn't read it at all.I do back up my phone occasionally, maybe once a month, but lost everything; every photo and video I had taken of my new kitten since I got her because of this.  It is very surprising since Sandisk is usually quite reliable.  My wife has the same card in her phone, we got them around the same time, and hers is still working normally so far.YMMV, but always back up your data regularly (more than once a month) if you are taking a lot of pictures and video.",
"This is the second time I have purched this SanDisk card. I have one in my Note 3 and now one in my new Galaxy Note Pro 12.2. I really wanted the 128GB for my Pro but the price was too high for me to justify spending around $120 when this one is currently around $43. I hope the price drops soon on the 128GB! This was simple to install and didn't require formatting on either device, just plug and save. It was that easy.",
"After buying a generic card and having a terrible experience, I purchased the SanDisk Ultra.  My only regret was not buying this product first.  SanDisk is a brand worth buying.",
"Full Disclosure: I use no other brand of SD Card other than SanDiskHaving said that, I was pleased to discover an SD Card designed for people who demand fast transfer speeds for HD video applications. I purchased this item for my tablet PC and have been pleased with its functionality. The adapter is great for accessing via computer to transfer files directly if USB is not desired.",
Changes the whole look of the Echo ... after i purchased i think i should have gone with the tan leather. But blue is my favorite color and it adds a bit of a pop to a mundane looking black disk! The texture is also really nice feel and look to it!,
"Insert it and use it, it is exactly that easy to use. And did I mention it is also very fast? I purchased this for my new Nook HD+ tablet and it gives me a lot of storage space for anything I wish to keep on the tablet, pictures, music, documents, eBooks, anything else I wish to create or copy to the tablet. I am very pleased with the performance and price of this purchase.",
"This card seems to work well ,enough speed and so far it's working just fine ,good value for great quality ,LHB",
Great Micro SD access is quick and it works awesome for my phone. The price is also a plus. I would definitely recommend this product.,
I like things that work and I like things that work the way they're sold to me and when they do I give it a great review so trust me when I say this works and you won't find a faster SD card out there.,
Data in and data out seems to be nice and fast. It was a quick ship. If I needed more I would order the SanDisk.,
Works well in our tablets and phones,
"plenty of memory for my gopro, durable, and small enough to lose haha... make sure your phone/device can handle it",
"Imagine a lap top but smaller this kindle can do anything you enjoy doing on a laptop. I use mine to watch Netflix , check my facebook and pretty much anything else. I am supper satisfied with this product and I would say that it was an investment well put.",
"My gf wanted music on here phone so I got her this, she hasnt put any music on her phone yet so I cant say how well or not this works, but the phone recognized it and its been sitting in there for a couple months now.",
I am enjoying it so far. Great for reading. Had the original Fire since 2012. The Fire used to make my eyes hurt if I read too long. Haven't experienced that with the Paperwhite yet.,
SanDisk is the best brand. This chip does exactly what it should do and does it at very good speed. My Samsung Galaxy Note 2 loves this chip.,
it's a class 10 so it's pretty fast.  I am using it in my HTC EVO LTE 4G phone hoping that it had UHS-1 capability.  It doesnt seem to so it's just a class 10.,
I've been using this card in my smartphone for a while now. It had enough room for all of my 20gig of music. Its got tons of pictures and downloads too. Still plenty of room. If you like to store data on your phone this will be good for you. no hiccups so far with this product.,
"Since other people have gone into detail on the device, I will answer only the burning questions I had before I received mine. I was very happy with my Paperwhite and would not have bought this had mine not been stolen/lost (not sure which). My husband still has his Paperwhite, so I was able to compare them side by side.CAN I USE THE WALL CHARGER FROM MY PAPERWHITE TO CHARGE THE VOYAGEYes.CAN PRESSING THE PAGE TURNERS CAUSE REPETITIVE USE ISSUESI don't think so. You can turn down the pressure it needs (which is very slight) or you can turn it off completely and turn pages with a tap. It's actually nice to have both options.CAN YOU SEE WHERE TO TURN THE PAGES IN THE DARKNo. You can guess where the page forward area is, but the page back is a dot, so guessing would be difficult. But you can still tap to turn pages. Using a cover helps, as the edge of the cover would be right over the dot.DOES THE FEEDBACK BUZZ ANNOY YOU WHEN YOU TURN PAGESI think it does take a little getting used to, but you can turn it down, and I think I will not notice it after a while. (There's no sound it's purely tactile.) Months later: It's not distracting you forget about it.IS THE ADJUSTABLE LIGHT NICEI still do it manually. It doesn't adjust the way I'd like it to. Not as bright in good light as I'd like, and not as dim while my husband is sleeping next to me. Note that if you want to use the night light, you have to set that separately from Auto Adjust. Settings/Device Options/Screen Light. I'm not actually sure that the night light is working. It was at 18 when I turned off the light (this is quite bright), and I checked it about 10 minutes later, and it was at 17.Read more",
"im using this card on my galaxy note 2 but it's slow, and phone constantly unable to read the card",
"My Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD works fine with a 16GB SanDisk card, but the 32GB card died in less than 3 months.  SanDisk will replace the card under warranty, but the SanDisk customer support team informs me that the replacement process takes about a month.  For two months, the card worked flawlessly, and then it started to have intermittent errors.  I thought it might be a problem with my phone, so I tried a 16GB card, and I never had a problem. When I returned to the 32GB card, the intermittent problems returned and got worse.  Eventually the card completely died, and it is no longer recognized by either my phone or my computer-connected card reader.  Both Windows 7 and my phone now act as if no card were inserted even when it's well seated.I plan to update this when I have used my warranty-replacement card for three months, but that will be at least four months from now.",
It doesn't hurt to have more memory than it does to have too little.  I have been using SanDisk brand for some time now so I can say for my self that they are pretty reliable (let's just hope I didn't jinx myself).,
"My remote went out just a couple weeks after we received the Fire Stick.Put new batteries in it and it worked another couple weeks. Then, I didn't have time to get to it until the return time was out. I tried batteries again, cleaning the ports, and everything I could think of. Because I can't get the cheap remote working, this Fire Stick is STUCK on the television on which is was originally installed.... until I pay for a new remote. Amazon, you can do better than this. I see that there are many, many posts of people like me whose remotes just don't work. A phone app is nice, but shouldn't HAVE to be the only answer besides another remote that costs 30 of the original whole product.",
"Love the large storage space, great when you get a less expensivettablet and make it better than an expensive one.",
"I just love this tap!! It is so much fun. The music is so great. I play the relation music every night,every night. Best thing ever!",
This is a very capable microSDHC at a very fair price. I popped it in cell phone (Samsung Galaxy S4) and it got mounted without any hassle. I didn't need any type of formatting. Read and write speed is quite fast while using while transferring data to my PC. Shipping was fast and tracking it was easy. This a product I highly recommend.,
Great memory card! Got this on one Amazon's daily deals at a terrific price! Getting ready to upgrade my cell phone and want to have a larger capacity memory card ready to go. This is just what I needed!,
"So far this has outlasted my 32gb scandisk micro, faster data transfer and my phone seems to breathe, highly recommend the ultra over the regular",
Great purchase! with the best price on the market so far. I appreciate the fact that this product came ready to use and very well packaged. Please let me know if you have a thumb drive with built in security at a very low price. Money is tight but the product is worth the investment.,
I bought this for my MS Surface tablet and this tripled my storage space.  I copy all my media to this and have endless hours of entertainment when I'm on a plane ride or in hotels.,
"I purchased this card for use in a Microsoft Surface Pro tablet -- for that, it works great. 64GB is a nice capacity, card was cheap and it works just fine.The problem, however, was in transfer speed. It's rated at &#34;up to&#34; 30MB/sec which I guess is true.. but mine has never reached anywhere close to that. Using 3 different readers (the Surface Pro itself, a higher-end desktop PC with built-in MicroSD reader and an external USB 3.0 MicroSD reader.. in all, it maxed out around 10-12MB/sec (and on multiple smaller files it maxed out closer to about 5MB/sec total). I know it's not the card readers as I have been able to reach speeds of 90MB/sec with other/faster cards.The card itself DOES work fine. For that I give it 5 stars. The price is great for the size, for that I give it 5 stars. The transfer speeds are just disappointing though.. taking 5 minutes to transfer an iTunes movie file is a long time.. it'll take hours to fill the full card.. If you only load data once, it's not so bad, but if you're always adding/deleting/moving data, it's slow and will get annoying quickly!",
It has work great.....i have used it a lot iun my smartphone to storage photos music and game roms....works perfect,
"Works great in my Samsung Galaxy S4.I also use a SanDisk card in my DroidX, after some bad experiences with another manufacturer's 32GB micro-SD card that occasionally flaked out.Beware imitation cards that may look almost identical.",
"As expected, SanDisk delivered again with this card. Very fast transfers and a lot of data to use up. Bought it for a galaxy s 3 and it works great.",
"Let me make things simple for everyone. This is a great tablet and a beautiful device. It has everything 97 of tablet users need and want. The 3 that are power users can pay up for an iPad.Amazon Prime is a must if you have one of these tablets. And if you already have Amazon Prime it is a no-brainer to buy this tablet if you are looking for an entertainment device that also gives you the ability to check email and surf the web as needed.People complain that one app here or there is missing. If you want the tried and true, the basics, then you have nothing to worry about. Of course there is a weather app. Of course there is a NYT app. All the 'normal' stuff is there. Sure, a particular game or more specialized app may not be available but anything most people actually 'want/need' is going to be there.This is not a device for the office. If you want to review spreadsheets then clearly do not buy it. That goes without saying.As for the actual device it feels well put together. The plastic back actually felt closer to metal to me. It has a solid feel. The screen is beautiful and has PLENTY of resolution for watching movies, surfing the web, etc. It is also sufficient for reading, though the Kindle Paperwhite admittedly has clearer print so if you only plan to read on this device then get the Paperwhite. (Also, I find the Word Runner feature to be quite intriguing- in fact I think we all may read using this method in a few years.)Before buying the device I read that load times are slow and switching between apps is trouble. What I have found is that it may take a second for your movie or app to load...but we are talking a second...or two MAX! If you can't wait two seconds for something then I don't know what to say.Read more",
"I use this card in my tablet, no problems, very fast. Excellent product and VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDIt was just what I needed for my tablet. Just the right amount of memory and the right price",
"this is a great card and product, just need to watch out for device compatibility. Got it on sale for the Samsung Galaxy Note II and it works great! Also came with an adapter.",
"Works great right out of the package, makes a great addition with the 32 GB Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet and will recommend it to anyone.",
I have this in my wife's Nokia Lumia 521 and it works really well. The card seems to stream data well and the phone has never behaved oddly with this card,
I literally use this thing every single day. Love it.,
"Bypass the &#34;cheaper&#34; clones and get SanDisk. Your  data is wprth much more than the little that you &#34;save&#34; using the cheap imitations. Trust me, I just found that out for myself.",
Got this for my cell phone (Motorola Razr M) and it works just fine. hundreds of albums and thousands of pictures and I still have 15 gb of memory left!,
Perfect! Got this in addition to the new 16gb tablet when it was released and my son loves it and if it drops it is well protected. Thanks Amazon,
"Works, works perfectly, super cheap... what's not to love?  There are tons of choices and this really does very well at transfer speeds and doubles (or more) your portable space.  Couldn't be happier.",
Amazing unit Easy to set up just remember to also purchases an hdmi to hdmi cord that does not come with the Amazon fire tv or you will have to wait to get started. This makes my tv look more crisp and clear than it ever has. Easy to use. Absolutely love it,
Fungible micro SD card that works as expected.  Now for filler text to get past the idiotic word count minimum.,
"It took 6 days for me to get 2 of these cards when I made the order early in the morning-normally that'll get my product to me the next evening. Not SIX DAYS LATER!Be warned, this was the slowest shipping I've had for my Paid Prime Account since I started. If you need these cards quickly, buy from a different seller.",
"Very fast, very big. Just wish it were a bit less cash so I could buy more for my other storage needs.",
Works as well as the Echo and now has a skill that can enable it to be voice activated rather than having to tap it. Battery charge lasts a long time and sound quality is good. Easy to move around in and out of the house. Will work anywhere you have WIFI. If you have the tap you may not have a need to invest in the more expensive Echo.,
"The card was perfect.Bought it for my Virgin Moble Smart phone as it only had a 2 gig card in it.Their Geek squad told me I needed a larger card as my memory to download applications was almost out!! (Only had 2 dowloads on it!!!).After purchasing and  inserting the expensive card, I got the same screen --- can not download applicationas memory is almost filled.Turned out the memory card has no bearing on applications being downloaded - they are  stored on internal built in memory.Seems the phone I was suggested to purchase only has 2 gigs of internal memory.Was not told to me when I got it",
This. Is a great charger. I like it better than the square ones.,
"I don't know, but it's a bunch. This card works great in my Nook HD, no problems installing or using it.",
"works well with my hero3 black gopro.its not on the approved micro SD HC card list from gopro, but it should. works great and low cost - cant beat it.",
Used this card in my Galaxy S3 and have had no problems.  Tons-o-room for what ever you want and more.,
"Finally a protector that works on the fire Phone. It is as advertised. Probably the easiest one I have put on (I have put screen protectors on several phones and tablets). No bubbles. But the best part is that this one actually works on the fire phone. This is the third screen protector I have tried. The first one was Glazz temper glass (this is when I found out about the issue with the sensors on the phone, you cannot cover them if you want the phone to work properly per Mayday). The second one was Mr Shield for the Fire Phone. Although the illustration showed cut outs for 4 of the 5 sensors, what was shipped had no cut outs for the sensors. The Yoshi has 5 cut outs for the sensors. Though it is a little pricey, it was well worth the money. MAYDAY was very helpful in finally getting me to this protector",
"Ain't technology amazing?  I got this card for my mom when we bought her a new smart phone.  I wanted her to have plenty of room for pictures, music and some movies.",
Go two during a &#34;Deal of the Day&#34;. Could not test USB3.0 performance since I dont have a USB3 port.,
"maybe the speed is not fast to beat others, but sandisk is always reliable. I have several sandisk SD/TF card, and they are never damaged. the data security is always very important.",
"I think I got 8 or 9 months out of this before it started to fail. It is still working intermittently but my phone will suddenly stop being able to read it for no apparent reason. &#34;Designed for durability&#34; my foot. It might survive in salt water but it didn't survive in a phone that, frankly, doesn't get a whole lot of use. This is the first Sandisk product I've ever had fail on me. It may still be under warranty but I don't care. Now that I have to replace it I'm going to go with another brand.",
"I use this card to back up some of the files, that I have on my work computer (at home).  and be able to use them on my laptop computer",
"Best Buy was running a sale on these and I thought I'd give it a try. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. I'm an Apple guy so Siri has been my ""go to"" virtual assistant. I must say that I am duly impressed with Alexa. She seems to understand me better than Siri does. All the Skills and the ability to play music by just asking is really great!The fact that this is all available in a portable device that I can take with me everywhere I go is so useful. The Tap remembers both wifi and cellular hotspot connections so I can use it anywhere. Unlike its non-portable brother the Echo, you push a button to issue commands to Alexa. On the plus side, you don't have to say Alexa. On the negative side you still have to push the button. I understand why this has to be the case as it would not last long on battery power if Alexa was listening all the time. Amazon should issue a firmware update to allow Alexa to listen all the time when plugged in.The sound quality is good, not great. Other speakers in the $129 category sound better. But none have all the convenience of Alexa, Bluetooth, Wifi and portability in one package.I'll be buying more as Christmas gifts!",
"I am rating this product with 4 Stars, simply because I have yet to learn if my Samsung Galaxy Note II (purchased on 11/03/12) is causing &#34;defective&#34; and &#34;reformat&#34; messages to ocassionally appear on screen or this SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-032G-U46A is culprit. However, I have yet to &#34;loose anything&#34; stored on this card. Otherwise, if the messages did not appear and/or I learn for sure it is a phone problem, I would rate this card with 5 Stars.",
I purchased this for my GoPro Hero 3+. It works just fine; I have not complaints. I would recommend this item.,
purchased this item to store movies for use in my sons nabi 2. Works perfectly and at a great price.,
"If you want a certain level of privacy and at the same time a speech enabled assistant, then this is the product for you. The Tap only listens to your, when you push the ""button, otherwise it is deaf to its surroundings. You get the awesome power of Alexa, provided by Amazon, and no worries about anyone listening to you surreptitiously.",
I want to upgrade the memory to my Samsung Note II. It is great to be able to instantly double my storage capacity. I am waiting for the 128 GB to down in price.,
"There are plenty of these on the market, but SanDIsk is a brand I trust, great size, and a really good value.",
"Exactly what you're hoping for in a micro-SD card. Tons of space and super fast. And YES--local storage is absolutely necessary for media storage! Tunes, videos, even pictures....back them up on the cloud, but keep a copy/copies local!",
Can't beat the price.,
Best deal I could find on fast microSD card.  Seems to work fine in our new Android tab.  Can't lose!,
"I used this to turn my Nook Color into an android.  It was incredibly easy to install and works great.  I haven't had any problems with it.  The read and write speeds are phenomenal, given that I am running an entire operating system off just this card.  The price was great too!",
"I have a large music collection that I like to play from the phone. This allows me to put a lot more on the phone than I have in the past. I had no compatibility problems with it. Plugged it in and it worked. Can't get better than that. As far as speed goes, it's as fast as any card I've had in the phone. I have noticed no lag or other issues reading or writing to it in the phone. I don't use it outside of the phone so I can't comment on direct read/write speeds.",
"no problems works well does what it is supposed to do, store files.  Pretty quick read and write speed as well",
"Not as fast as advertised most of the time, actually slowed down my Note 3 when I filled it with movies leaving only about 8gb free, switched to a faster card due to that, but it could also be the phones fault. All in all it's a good card with good speed and size for the money.",
"Works great in my Samsung phone. Fast Enough to not really notice it is here.Came with an app that  shows disk usage both on card and internally, as well as Drop Box. Slightly useful.===Update: 1 year later it's become completely unreadable by any device. I was about to throw it out until I noticed that the warranty on this is pretty good. Contacted SanDisk, sent the old one back, and received a new card in a week. Bugs me that it stopped working -- it went from working to completely unfunctional in about 2 days. During that time the devices were complaining about corruption every couple of times.",
Tons of storage and the read and write speed it an added bonus. Blows people away how quick my phone's ready to take the next pic.,
"Still wondering how they fit 64,000,000,000 bites on a card like this. But this car is plenty fast and compatible with my devices.",
"If you like the Kindle Fire HD then you will love the Kindle Fire HDX. The new device runs three times faster, is lighter in weight, and the battery lasts slightly longer. The sound quality on this device is excellent and the display quality is absolutely stunning. Below are some of the features to expect from the Fire HDX. BUILD QUALITY---There is NO blue haze on the 8.9 HDX.---The build quality is excellent.---Auto contrast is good (not buggy).---Operating system is very intuitive except after downloading free prime videos to watch offline. If you remove the videos from your Carousel then, from the video menu, you must go to the left side bar, and click *downloads* to see your videos. PRIME DOWNLOAD ISSUES (free video download limitations)Prime members can download selected Prime Instant Videos to watch when not connected to the internet. There are major restrictions imposed on prime videos as listed below.---Not all Prime titles are available for download.---Most popular prime titles are NOT available for download.---There is a max of 25 titles that can be downloaded free at any one time.---Prime titles have a viewing period.---Viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the video, or 15-30 days (which ever comes first).---After the viewing period expires you need to reconnect to the internet.---Titles can be downloaded to only two separate devices at a time.---If you exceed the device quota then you must delete one of the titles before adding to another device.---There is no way to know which titles can be downloaded unless you have the HDX (amazon does not place a banner on the titles other than to say PRIME).Read more",
I don't know what else that I can add to other 5 star reviews except to say that this installed flawlessly in my Nook HD+.,
"Great little card.  The only problem I have experienced may not even be related to the card, but Android OS itself.  I experience buffering/'hiccups'/pauses when watching a video if I also have my utorrent client in the background downloading.  I am not sure if this is limited to the card itself and possibly a faster write speed is needed, or it's the fault of the phone's OS.  However, I am confident that it's operating within spec.Card looks good too.. too bad it's in the case of my phone never to be seen.",
Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family.,
"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more",
Super,
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
Bought as a family gift. We use it all the time now. Very helpful and covenient,
"I've had this Kindle for a while now. Many of the reviews say it all so I don't think I could add much. But I feel like I need to speak on behalf of this Kindle to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought. If this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it. So I have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us allDo you have any clue what you bought Let's all say it out loud: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!!!!!! It is an entry level model with no light. Amazon has always sold non lighted Kindles, and I still have many of them. They are a cheap way to get into the e-reader scene. Can you read a real book in the dark Of course not. So these non lighted Kindles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light. It is ridiculous to buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because it doesn't have a light. Read the product descriptions. This Kindle has no light, the Paperwhite and Voyage do.Scream all to the heavens: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE PAGE TURNING BUTTONS!!!! To buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because your old Kindle had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane. Could you not see when you clicked on BUY that this Kindle had no page turning buttons. Sometimes I think there are two kinds of Kindle owners: those who want page turning buttons and those who don't mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page. If you can tell by my sarcasm, I belong to the latter bunch.Then of course there are the technically deficient that have no clue what wifi is, are unable to sign on, and blame it on the Kindle. BAM! another 1 star review.Read more",
"I don't like Micro SD cards, but it's a necessary evil to save space on the GoPro Hero 3+. I find that they are too easy to misplace and it's annoying having to keep the empty shell around when I need to transfer the data to my computer via the SD slot. That said, the Class 10 speed is nice and I haven't had any real world data rate problems when shooting GoPro footage even at the higher frame rates and resolution.",
"This is just what the tablet needs, it increases the memory up to nearly 100 GB so I will bnever run out of storage space.",
"I have been using the same old 4gb card since I had a Motorola SLVR. I figured it was time to upgrade, I'm glad I did. The speed of the class 10 is a major difference in my smartphone. From taking pictures faster with less lag in between shots to shuffling through my music without a delay. Highly recommend to anyone looking to upgrade. With that being said, beware of fakes! I originally purchased one off of ebay, not paying attention to its location. It came shipped directly from china. It was DOA! Luckily I managed to get refunded through paypal. Didn't have that issue through Amazon though!",
"had it in my samsung tablet and it went bad after 2 months, wont let me reformat or read it or do anything with it. money down the drain.",
Love that you can take this anywhere and hook up to my Bluetooth. Great sound quality.,
"This little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming. My kids have quickly learned that Alexa is their personal DJ when hooked up to the Amazon Prime Unlimited Music program. Battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes. Some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass, but it does the job for our family.",
"There's not much to say about this product, other than it works perfectly as it should.  I originally bought this for a tablet that had an expansion slot, but I returned that for another tablet without one.  So I thought I didn't have a use for this card anymore, but I was wrong.  It turns out that when you put it in it's full size SD card adapter, it even works perfectly in my Nikon D90 DSLR.  Up until now I had been using a standard 8gb card, which was fine, but 64gb is even better!  I don't do burst shooting, so I can't attest to how quickly it can write, but I noticed no difference in speed between this and the standard card that I had been using.",
Charger has worked well for charging my Voyage. Comes as a separate purchase from the Voyage which I found. Think it should be bundledwith the purchase price of the Kindle Voyage.,
Love SanDisk and loved the price.,
"It's pretty much a commodity product made in the Far East, but what I store on it is pretty valuable.  I feel confident in SanDisk manufacturing quality control, in the end.",
"Does what it says it does, and does it like it says it will.  Installed in my Galaxy S5, no issues, and no complaints.",
This 64 gig unit lets me record hours of video in my GoPro Hero3. No need to carry extra memory cards with this unit for my website [...],
Great price for the size card your getting. Bought this for my S3. Can easily fit all my movies now.,
"It works, got on Black Fri deal or would have been cheap and gotten a 16-32GB. Nice to have endless room....I already have watched a movie while surfing net on phone (with pop out player). I have such a awesome phone now. It comes with a Standard SD Card adapter!!!!Funny story:I plugged it in and went to format and my phone wanted a password to format card. Dude I could not find anything about this and online some people asked the same question. Well, I realized what it was. If you have a lock screen on your phone, then it also puts that lock on formatting your card. What a Great idea Samsung thank you! What a duh moment for me.",
"The card works as expected. As long as I don't loose my data prematurely this will get 5 stars.  Overall, recommended.",
"Will review, when I install and use. Product arrived on time. Appears  to be quality and what I need. Will review soon.",
I have installed the product on my Surface runing windows 8 RT. Seems to recognize 57 gigs not bad. Thats almost all of it. If you have dealt with memor before you will know that several gigs are lost to programing.,
"This chip is super fast.  If you're going to use it in an Android device, I recommend formatting it in NTFS.",
"First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory. It would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage, go buy a computer.Display: One word, amazing. Maybe I am pushing it, but the screen is so clear. I own an iPhone 5 and my eyes prefer my kindle. I love reading on this machine and for the price, amazon did a good job with this one.Read more",
Made the mistake of leaving it in the car when I had a flat and had to buy 4 new tires. Went missing at the dealership so I never got to use it.,
"All I can say is, these are probably the best I could find, fast and furious!If you dont get class 10, you are taking the risk of dropped frames on your HD videos.besides they are pretty too!",
Well works just like any other SD card I don;t see ultra fast speeds or any thing. I shoved this guy into a Galaxy S4 and it works fine!,
"I have had good look with the SanDisk brand MicroSDHC. I still wanted to wait a while before reviewing, usually if these units are going to fail they fail in the first few days/weeks. This has been running in a LG Optimus phone and has been flawless since install. Still have a working SanDisk MicrSDHC 32GB that's over 2 years old, that I transfered from my old HTC to the Optimus and now in my Galaxy S3.",
"I am very disappointed in this card.  I usually don't have an issue with SanDisk, but this 32GB ultra card died after two months.  Died as in, no longer recognizable by PC / Camera or any device.  Now I have to wrestle with warranty claim.",
"I have zero complaints, this card does exactly what it should. I'm amazed by how inexpensive memory cards continue to get. These things are really useful to throw on your keychain because they're so small.Update: From 5 stars to 1. Dead after 4 months. Appears to be a fairly common issue: [...] Let's see how the RMA process goes....",
This card is exactly what I was expecting. It fit perfect in my tablet. I have enough memory to add my playlist of songs.,
"I needed this for my Samsung Galley tablet. It's doing the job it was needed for. I really didn't need the adapter, but most all micro SD cards come with them.",
Love it works great a lot of fun great for listening to music,
Great little device easy to connect to bluetoothDecent sound,
"Something this small with so much information stored on it freaks me out. But I've had zero problems with it over the past year. The only issue I had is that the adapter that came with it did not work. The microsd card went into it kind of sidways like it was made wrong. Luckily I had another adapter lying around, and the sd card itself works perfectly and I've had no issues with data loss or corruption.",
"I travel for work. More and more, I find myself leaving the Kindle Fire at home and traveling with just an e-ink Kindle. So when I broke my Kindle 3, I decided to replace it with this entry level Kindle (without special offers).What's good:* Smallest, lightest e-ink Kindle available.* Still has the page turn buttons!* Like all the e-ink Kindles, this thing has amazing battery life.What's just OK:* Only 2GB memory. More is better. Then again, after two years of buying books I'm nowhere near filling this thing up.* Text entry using the 5-way switch works, but that's about all. I'm surprised it works well enough that I can't consider it a negative.What's not so good:* The lighted cover costs nearly as much as the Kindle! Anyone thinking of picking up this Kindle and the lighted cover should look at the new paper white models with integrated frontlight.The new Kindles look awesome. But they don't take anything away from this Kindle. It may not have some of the bells and whistles of the other models but it also costs quite a bit less. The Kindle is exactly what I need for traveling. It works wonderfully as a basic, no-frills e-reader. Reviewing it as such, I have to give it five stars.",
Class 10 speeds are the only way to fly and with 29.71GB of usable space I think I should be good for a while.,
Love the color of the cas and seems to protect well. Loving this case.,
"I got a new phone and this was part of a dock and battery deal so I pulled the trigger. So far transfers have been fast and successful. It's only been a few months, but it just works.",
"Replaced a smaller and slower micro SD card in my phone. I've had other brands corrupt and die in the past. I've grown to only trust SanDisk.It is faster than most other micro-SD cards, the price was right at $27.",
"excellent gift, ok sound, great portability, would buy again",
"Worked as expected in both my Blackberry Z10 and my HP laptop and is plenty fast - writes at around 9.5MB/sec, but reads so far on my PC that I can't get an accurate number for the speed. I gave it four stars because the write speed falls a touch short of the Class 10 rating - it's honestly not enough to be an issue for me, but people who need the speed in a camera might be slightly disappointed. However, the capacity and price more than make up for that in my mind.Also, makes a great store for content in my Blackberry!",
This works great just like all SanDisk chips I have had. It's being used in My girlfriends Samsung Galaxy S3.,
This is the real deal. There are fakes out there and this is NOT one of them. This shipped directly from SanDisk Corporation! When purchasing from Amazon and the seller is different you never know what you may receive and they (the seller) are not always aware of fakes so you have to contact SanDisk to provide the serial code number off the card or send a pic to them so they may authenticate it. It's nice to not have to do that for a change! Checked the partition and it's correct. Also confirmed this card ir read by LG Optimus G Pro on AT&T network.,
It is a good card and does the job well.  Now I am going to have to fill in this space as there isn't much else to say about this.  Using this as expansion for Dell Venue 8 Pro.  Now have almost 64G of open capacity on the tablet.,
"I bought this to put into a wifi enabled USB flash drive. It works fine. I can get my entire CD collection on it, which was my goal.",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
Love the sound that comes out and Alexa is very informative!,
I'm not going to give you a detailed speed and what not but this SD card is fast compared to the other ones. You wouldn't really notice the difference in speed unless you're copying a huge file. I use this on my Note 2 and I take a butt load of pictures with my phone.,
"Holds stuff, and if you need anything further for a review then I am sorry. If you dont know that this is a memory card and hold stuff then I would recommend checking out something by Fisher Price.",
Ordered for my sons phone and was extremely happy with the card when it arrived. Would absolutely order again if needed.,
sound is greatdifficult to connect with hotel wifi'sseems durable,
"i bought this for only one use, to put in my samsung galaxy s3. i popped in the card, mounted and formatted in settings, and it works like a charm in the phone. HOWEVER(it's in caps pay attention!), when i took it out of the phone and put the microSD into the SD adapter and plugged into the sd card slot on the front of my pc(win7 x64) it asked to format the card(was already formatted by phone so was confused) so i hit ok, no biggie, it was empty anyways. windows did its thing and when it was &#34;ready to use&#34; it said the card was only 1MB(it showed 59.47GB in the phone). so my troubleshooting section of mind kicked in and i removed the card, and i just so happen to have a microSD slot in my computer's frontal bay and it wouldn't even show it was connected in windows explorer. so i took it out and put in another microsd card, voila it read, switched them out again, and nothing. so i decided to pull up my paragon hard disk utility, and it showed the same thing as windows, regardless how i tried formatting it. i gave up and put it back in the phone and mounted it.my s3 said it neded to be formatted. so i formatted it in the phone again and it showed just like it did the first time, 59.47GB. i then proceeded to install samsung kies and got my phone hooked up to my pc via usb cable, i opened the phone in windows explorer and right there it shows the phone memory at ~16gb and the sd card at 59.47 gb....i'm not quite sure what's going on with that, because the sd slots in my pc read my other cards just fine. but anyway i guess if you plan on using it in your phone or possibly other device exclusively because i can use it like a charm while it's in my phone, otherwise it seems pretty useless. so i guess just depends on what you're using it for. on a side not, be careful when you open the plastic package that contains the micro sd and sd adapter, be sure to open it over a large clear area, i opened it up the the living room with black tile floor and had to get a flashlight to find it when it jumped out on the holder(it just sets in the little plastic holder so even the slightest shake will send it flying when opening) i'm giving it 3/5 on here, but 5/5 if you're getting it for a phone, galaxy s3 at least because it works fine in mine",
Good no problems works well.,
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
"Not too much to say about the card, other than it works well in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  The price was great for such large storage and I believe you will be very happy with your purchase.",
"I use this with my Samsung Galaxy Player 4.2. Never had any issues, product works as described. I've been using it for almost a year and have almost used up all the space on it. I've never used the adapter with anything so I can't comment on that.",
"I bought this card for my new Samsung Galaxy Note 3, didn't have to do anything but put the card in the phone, no formatting needed. Transferred all of my pictures and a few videos along with about 15 GB of music everything loaded very quickly and I still have a ton of memory left to store whatever I want or need to. Bought this on Amazon at a much better price than I could find anywhere else. I ordered this with Amazons frustration free packaging, just pull the tab on the package and the card is in your hand in less than ten seconds. Recommend for anyone who wants a fast card and a lot of memory.",
The echo is easy to use and fun to use once you buy one you'll want them for all over your house.,
"Haven't got much to say about this. It's SanDisk, so you know what you're getting. Fast and reliable. Only complaint though is that Amazon wouldn't let me buy more than one in the same order. Other than that, it's just great.",
"the extra room on my phone is great but ive noticed since installing it that its a lil slow when transferring files from my phone to the card, its not like im sitting there forever but its a noticeable difference between my old card and this one",
"This new KFHD replaces last year's basic Kindle Fire. Although it has some cool new features, it lacks a camera, microphone, and HDMI port. For this reason, I'm glad I kept my 2012 model since it does have these 3 features! Here are my initial impressions of the 2013 Kindle Fire HD: I like the placement of the on/off volume buttons. Being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one. I never cared for the carousel (this is what you see when you turn your Kindle on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed), and now there's an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead, and the apps/books can be rearranged to your liking. I was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar (which is now being called home). I don't know why Amazon removed this option, and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel. But you can still bookmark your favorite web pages YouTube videos for easy access. When I play songs purchased from Amazon's MP 3 store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style. Nice feature, but it doesn't work on every song. This device has a cool new feature called Quick Switch, which allows us, when reading or using an app, to bring up recently accessed items with a swipe instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one.In terms of sound, I find it to be tinny and not as rich as it is on the original KFHD. But you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds. Ironically, music sounds muffled unless you hold the device in landscape mode with your hands covering the speakers. Holding it this way projects the sound out to you.Read more",
"So far so good. I use this with my mobil phone and the product run smoothly. No issue as of yet. Overall, I'm happy with this product.",
Nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better.,
"These cards never let you down.  They are priced well and always perform.  I don't really like micro SD because they are so small, but all the new devices are using them so I have to adapt",
Transfer files easily and very fast. Sandisk makes great SD card and they are very reliable. I am very pleased with this product.,
Works just fine. Thia card being so big will slow down your phone a little bit but works fine for me,
Fast product when place in my camera. I am very happy with this product. The product was received pretty fast.  The material was as described and much better.  I do recommend this product to anyone.,
"Not much to say about the excellence of SanDisk products. Fits well, adapter very easy to use. I never been disappointed in SanDisk.",
What can i say my old 8GB died and this is working like a champ trust the brand for a long time and expect nothing but the best,
Amazon is the tip of leading technology. Always have had great luck with their product.,
Tried this with its adapter on DSLR Camera and got some errors at times while trying to save data to card.  It is ok for other uses like computer external data.,
"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!",
Gets stuck sometimes in the adapter and is a little hard to pull out. But other than that is a great product,
"No question, it is really as fast as it's rated. How fast? Well, class &#34;10 SDHC&#34; means literally SD format, HC=High Capacity, Class 10 = 10MB/sec read-write. How fast is 10MB per second? Well, Class 4, the most common step down (i.e. cheaper) is Class 4, i.e. 4MB/sec. So Class 10 is 2.5 times faster. Why pay the difference?Digital cameras: at some point the number of pictures/sec or HD video is bottle-necked by the speed of the media it is being recorded to.Smart phones? I have a Samsung Note II. A Quad-core processor, wiz-bang yadda-yadda. Yes, I DO notice speed differences in camera, app performance (I use a spreadsheet app/browser/NetFlix/Music streaming, et al) is noticeably FASTER. Where do you think the phone stores stuff to when it doesn't use the factory installed memory? (iPhomes don't have an SD slot, and I wouldn't own a phone or tablet that doesn't -- I believe in choice in the computer realm)Oh yeah, SanDisk is a leader and pioneer in the SD format (where do you think the 'SD' came from?). The only other SDHC Class 10 card worthy of comparison is the Samsung brand, but then I might be biased on that one.",
"Got this for my Galaxy S3 android phone. As with most all San Disk products, it is high quality and I don't expect any problems.",
"Hello, the micro SD is perfect for my liquid image EGO camera HD, Very fast and great capacity! Excellent,  Recommended",
Um nothing much to really say about it . The adapter for it works but I gave it 3 stars because it goes in n out sometimes,

"Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version. For my 7 version review, please search for my HDX 7 review.My profile: Im a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do. It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more",
Purchased this for a fellow employee.  Product came quickly and packaged in original package.  The employee using it is happy.,
"Good price and working well. I used it for my Galaxy S3, S4, Note2 and Asus tf700, also purchased one for spare. Highly recommended.",
Great price and it's fast. Works well in my Note 3 using USB 3.0. I have movies shows and tons of music. I'm never bored anywhere I go.,
"Bought for GoPro Hero3.  Slips in, works great, keeps up with camera.  Awesome and cheap. Great for smartphones as well!",
"First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory. It would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage, go buy a computer.Display: One word, amazing. Maybe I am pushing it, but the screen is so clear. I own an iPhone 5 and my eyes prefer my kindle. I love reading on this machine and for the price, amazon did a good job with this one.Read more",
"I have a Samsung Note II and was on the verge of having to uninstall programs when the newest version of Android came out which allowed you to move applications to the external storage.After reading the reviews I purchased this card to replace my 4G card, now I have room for all my pictures videos and tons of apps. The performance is really great from what I can tell , the pictures , videos and apps load quickly and I have not had any issues with this at all.A must have to extend your Android storage.",
Love this 32gb micro sd card. I put it in my Samsung Galaxy Note phone. I just returned from a 3 day trip where I used it as my camera/video recorder. I kept it on HD quality the whole time. No problems at all. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating was because it actually only had 29gb of space instead of 32. If that is the norm then please excuse my ignorance!,
bought this to replace a faulty card on my phone and it works great. haven't had any performance or corruption issues with it at all.,

"I have had Apple TV and Roku for over a year and I can say without reservation that the Amazon Fire TV is far better for two reasons: 1. The program/movie I want to watch starts IMMEDIATELY with a single click, unlike Roku and Apple TV which can take forever at times after several clicks. 2. Voice search. Having to type search can be cumbersome and a nuisance. Unless I want to watch one of the ITunes movies I own on the Apple TV, I always use the Fire. It's simply better",
"no problems so far using it with the included SD adapter on my micro 4/3 camera, no problem when shooting 60p HD video!so far so good!",

"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",

"It worked fine at a start and offered great speeds, but after a few months my cell phone started to eject and reconnect it several times per day (at least once per hour).  That made my phone eat up its whole battery life in half the time.  I installed Watchdog and noticed that the Google+ process also incremented its CPU usage.  I read somewhere that it was caused by this kind of problems with microSD cards, probably because the process was trying to scan the memory once inserted.  In another forum there are also reports of this kind of problems with some of the latest generation SanDisk microSD cards.Now I decided to purchase a Samsung one which can be found similarly priced.  My phone stopped acting up, and its battery life came back to normal.",
I've used one of those cards in my phone for about 2 years now and never had a single problem. Recently bought another for my tablet and so far so good. Recommended,
Hard to rate a memory hard in very many words. This memory card does what it suppose to do and I haven't had any problems.,
"I got this so I made sure my new smart phone had enough storage. I, unknowingly, got the phone with a ton of space but this was an awesome addition to the phone and how much I've been able to store on it. Highly recommended.",
"As always, this memory card just works.  I've used SanDisk products for over a dozen years and they have always worked when needed. More often, I've outgrown their capacities then worn them out.I'm happy so far.",
"We have bought two of these.  You get an open slot with your smartphone and you should use it.  Pictures, movies, and music will fill up your primary device storage in a heartbeat.  Further, it is a good practice to have your &#34;personal&#34; stuff, like the things I just mentioned, saved to an external drive so as to not be in the mix should the horrific happen and you have to get your phone wiped.Word to the wise:  ENCRYPT YOUR STORAGE, both Primary Device and External SD.  For the Samsung Galaxy S4 (at least), that, in turn, requires that you use a phone unlock code of at least SIX characters, with at least one of them being non-numeric.  I know this can appear to be a pain in the butt, but the first time your device is ganked and you aren't panicking because your stuff is encrypted, you'll thank me.  Nekkid pictures aren't the only things of concern, mind you.  An unencrypted device, stolen by the wrong hands, isn't just $25 in crack cocaine money...it is much, much more than that in terms of lucrative identity theft opportunities.  Don't be &#34;that guy&#34;.  Encrypt your phone.  There are walk-throughs showing how to do that for whatever device you happen to have on YouTube, I am certain.",
Card works fine with no hiccups or issues. Speed of card is fine with the dash camera and download to laptop.,
"I use this in my Midland Action Cam for hunting and fishing. I rely on Sandisk because of it's quality. I have over a dozen different memory cards and of all the brands, I like Sandisk the best. Never an issue",
Remote worked well for about 30 minutes but now jumps around several spots when using the up down left right buttons. I didn't really like using the phone app but will now have to go back to it.UPDATE: I was contacted by customer service and was advised to remove batteries and insert a fresh pair (although batteries were brand new to begin with) and to unplug the firestick to restart it. The remote has been working properly since doing this. I also used the same batteries. I just hope this isn't something that will need to be done frequently.,
Bought 2 of these. One to be used on my Sony PSP 3000 with MicroSD To Memory Stick Pro Duo Adapter and the other on my Samsung Galaxy S4. Works great on both. Enough storage for what i need it for.,
The tap is amazing. portable and connected to all amazon content,

They have an easier time using the other devices (kindle fire, or kindle app on their other tablets) which is unfortunate because I wanted them to be able to have something strictly for reading. Also for a kids bundle its very disappointing that most children's books don't work with this device. No where on the kids bundle page does it state this is an 8th generation kindle. Now, I have a few kindles and have bought new ones as they come out, but I haven't followed close enough to know this is an 8th generation without that information available on the page. I planned on buying these devices so bought a bunch of books listed as available for e-readers 5th generation. I assumed since it was the latest one listed, and my new devices didn't have anything listed, it was the latest. I just found out today that its an 8th generation and a lot of books aren't available on this device, with hopes that will change in the future. So now I have a lot of money spent on books they have to read on their old devices (the devices with games and access to the internet and videos). I spent extra money on 2 new devices so they had something to use daily without that access, all to find out their age appropriate books can't be read on their new devices. I think this information should be available to parents who are looking for a device they can sit their kids down with and not have to worry about them not focusing on something so important to them. Reading is important to children of all ages, and they can only read at their own levels.Read more",
got it on time in a simple but secure packaging. inserted it and worked without issues. comes in a clear plastic case with an SD adapter. the is the typical SD case size.the sale price of $16 and change was great as well.love it!,
I forgot I had I a SD card in my device. It's a seamless part without hesitation. Micros are hard to remove but that is a device flaw,
"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysOctober 11, 2013Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound, and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD. As you correctly point out, the new Kindle Fire HD is the successor to last year's entry level Kindle Fire, which does not include features such as camera, microphone, or HDMI port. You are also correct to point out that this device does not support Mayday, although there are still multiple ways to get help for free directly from your device. We hope you enjoy the new features and services. Thanks, The Kindle Team",
"I love the features of the Amazon Fire TV, the price is right, the interface is great, but it after less than 5 minutes keeps disconnecting from my WIFI and giving a network error message. Mind you my router is about 5 feet from it. Needless to say because of this I cant watch Amazon prime TV shows or movies on it. I have an Apple TV in my sons room way down the hall also connected to WIFI, the Apple TV never disconnects from WIFI. I would love to be able to use the unit, not sure why this is happening but I may have to return it. Shame....",
What a great find under $50. It works perfectly for my tablet for extra storage for photos. do buy this.,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"Didn't realize this was as small as it was, nice speed and great use cross device with the included adapter.  Lots of storage space for transferring files and films.",
"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more",
"I use it on my SAMSUNG GALAXY S3, it works great... more space to save all my documents, pictures and more :)",
"works great in my ASUS android tablet. the 32GB specification seems to limit the size, but it works great, some I am happy to write more words.",
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
"Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version. For my 7 version review, please search for my HDX 7 review.My profile: Im a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do. It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more",
"This is a wonderful streaming device. I have been an Apple TV man since 2008, but I have decided that I just might never return to my Apple TV. I have used/owned all 3 generations and have known them inside and out (unlocked my 1st generation for secret stuff. Shhhh) and swore by them for years. I just received my amazon fire tv device this afternoon and plugged it up without a hitch. Voice command is a nice touch, but I was most impressed with the speed of the quad core processor. No more waiting for my videos to buffer, and this is especially important in my house where my wife, kids, and I are sometimes simultaneously streaming videos. Final word: If you're just looking for a great device to stream both Netflix and Amazon Prime, then you've found the right streamer.",
"Always the worry that an SD card is a fake, even at retail stores. But no issues here and the price is great.",
"I purchased two of these one for my Samsung tablet and one for my samsung galaxy note. Great hardware that is truly speedy, responsive and meets my needs!",
"Purchased for my galaxie 3 phone and it fits and works. Not much else to say. ok, the price was good.Update 06/24/13It stopped working! All of a sudden my phone started alerting me that the sd chip was mounting and dismounting. Caused the battery to drain in a few hours. Everything on the card was lost. I attempted to re-format in my laptop. Card was not found by laptop.Googled the issue and found many blogs of others experiencing the same problem.I will attempt to return to Amazon.",
"Even though it's a class 10 card, writing data to it still takes a while. However, the card performs well in my phone. If you can get a good deal on this, you won't be disappointed.",
Great product as promised. Slipped right into my Samsung Galaxy S4 with no issues and I like the adapter they provided in case I want to load data from my laptop directly into the card. I have not done any serious benchmarking around how media performs running off of the card vs. on-board memory but I have not noticed any difference.,
"Okay, there are tons of these cards available.  Why did I pick this one?  Because it IS NOT all black!  when I have to switch out cards in my devices, it's easy to drop or misplace these tiny cards.  Having one that is not all black makes it easier to track.  Works well, no complaints, good price.",
"Not much more to say, really. Work, is faster than my Class 4 16GB card and provides the space to copy DSLR photos (when I hook the phone to my Nikon 5100 with the USB host cable)",
"My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new friend named Alexa!

Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.Happy HolidaysRoy",
"Amazing how they keep making bigger storage cards and the price goes down. Wow, these are nice for holding lots of stuff",
I am using this item to extend the Memory Capacity on the Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet. Very good price with free shipping(Order &#62;$35) and it works as advertised!,
"8 gb card works fine in the device, but this 32 gb card will unmount when moving or copying large amounts of data.Never tried reformatting or in-depth troubleshooting, but I expect products from a reputable company like SanDisk to just work.",
"I used this sd in my psp (with an adapter) and works fine, all the games stored into this memory ran perfectly without lags",
"I've had good luck with SanDisk cards on my cameras, and so far this card for my Android phone is no exception. Fast and no errors, though admittedly I haven't had it very long.",
No problems with the card what so ever. Bought it for a new tablet just plugged it in and started to move files to it in a second.,
Picked up a Note 3 and added this card for an extra 32GB. Scandisk is top of the line and never gives me any issues when I use their cards. Highly recommended.,
Great service I loved all of the items and were great gifts,
Sandisk class 10 as far as memory cards to me is the best! As for the price of $20+ this card is all you need for advance cameras phones ext. I bought it for my Go Pro Black edition and it worked flawlessly without and buffering error. For my money Sandisk is where I would put my money on before any other memory card...,
I picked up this storage device to use in my phone. I only had a 1 gig mini sd in there for music ad it was getting pretty full. Now 30 plus gigs of free space later i can download to my hearts content.,
Love my memory card. The bigger the better for my phone. I put all kinds of music movies porn whatever on my memory card in a snap. Thank you.,
"item arrived faster than expected, and works great as additional memory on my cell phone. comes with adapter to use in regular SD card slots, which came in handy when transferring data from old card to new card. A+++",
"Reliable, no comments, it is a well know brand. I use it for my dash cam, the problem I have is with the dash cam (cheap Chinese).",
Ultra quick. You can take several pictures in sequence and this memory keeps it pace. Even at movies it shows its speed.,
"As soon as I saw that this card was announced on the various tech sites out there, I knew that I had to buy one.  I went to Amazon and picked one up for $120.  This is a steep price compared to 64gb cards, but this is the largest capacity commercially available.  And I don't want to be swapping out micro SD cards.  That is just so inconvenient.  I did various speed tests on this card and can confirm that you can get 30MB/s+ read speed.  Fastest I saw was a little over 40MB/s.  Write speed varied greatly and seemed to decrease the larger the file got.  Minimum write speed i saw was just under 10 MB/s.  I use this on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and have not have any issues with it.",
Not all memory cards are the same.  Class 10 means faster transfers.  This one is even faster.  Works as promised.,
I bought this for my new Samsung G5. I installed it and the card was immediately recognized. It should be big enough for lots of music and videos.,
"My remote went out just a couple weeks after we received the Fire Stick.Put new batteries in it and it worked another couple weeks. Then, I didn't have time to get to it until the return time was out. I tried batteries again, cleaning the ports, and everything I could think of. Because I can't get the cheap remote working, this Fire Stick is STUCK on the television on which is was originally installed.... until I pay for a new remote. Amazon, you can do better than this. I see that there are many, many posts of people like me whose remotes just don't work. A phone app is nice, but shouldn't HAVE to be the only answer besides another remote that costs 30 of the original whole product.",
It does what it is supposed to do and is pretty fast.  Sandisk is a great company when it comes to flash memory,
"I bought this card to go with my new Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition.  After using it for a few days with only the onboard storage, I felt the need to have a little more space.  The price for this card was just right, and I have always had great success with SanDisk memory devices, whether they are USB or SD or what have you.  I use this card to take all sorts of music and movies with me whenever I have to go anywhere, and there is absolutely no lag or hiccuping on playback.  I also set this card as the default to store photos and videos taken with the tablet, and there is no noticeable delay when taking photos.  This card works so well, I just bought a second one to replace an old 8GB card in my phone.",
"I bought this card excited to expand the 16GB of storage that come with the phone.  However, this card had issues mounting when I would start the phone.  After some research, it looks like SanDisk had a large batch of bad cards.  If formatted as FAT32 the issue rarely occurred.  But when formatted as exFAT, like is ideal for mobile devices, it would happen every time the phone was reset.  Take caution with these cards.  The bad batch should be over, I have read, but if looking to use in a Samsung phone, maybe considering buying a different type of card, as this is the only brand I have seen with issues.  Other than that, it is a good card with great size.",
The SanDisk 32GB Micro SD Class 10 is a reliable SD card with amazing transfer speeds. There is no noticeable lag transfering even the largest RAW images to it. Hadn't had any problem with it.,
"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs.

I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list for apps, much less so. 90 of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7 tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download Casablanca but not able to download The Avengers even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HDDisplay: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 vs. 7.6 x 5.4 x 0.4). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9 version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special reading mode to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive (229 vs. 199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a 20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is 10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The Recommended for you display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule Quiet Time on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7 HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8 iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9 x 4.5 x 0.34 and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87 x 5.3 x 0.29 and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX 11 hours (17 hours when reading) Nexus 9 hours iPad Mini 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only 139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at 229 vs. 399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. 90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.

I started to have trouble with my card after about 3 months. I shall attempt to get a replacement and hopefully the new one lasts much longer.,
"I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same connectivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...portability mainly with a long battery life, but with plagued by connectivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound, when it is connected and responding, is amazing.",
"This card had rave reviews, so I decided to get it to use it with my new GoPro Hero3 camera.  I liked that it had a high capacity and it was class 10 which would allow me to maximize the features of my camera.  As soon as it arrived I popped it in to the camera for a quick test run and after it was successful I then packed it in my luggage for a snorkeling trip.  3 days into taking awesome footage with my camera this SD card started resulting in SD card errors which made my data unrecoverable.  Fortunately I still had some time in my trip to go get a different memory card with better reliability. These memory cards appear to be hit or miss, and in my case it was a miss.  I can not recommend this card for purchase.  It appears that this company has a problem with the Quality Control process, and you can see that reviews are either overwhelmingly positive or as is my case, 1 star/negative.  It looks as though they just accept a certain amount of faulty memory cards.  Unfortunately for me, I missed the window to return this card because I was travelling, and I am stuck with a useless micro SD card.  I've had better luck with Kingston, and Transcend brands. Lexar and Samsung have also served me well in the past.  I will no longer purchase any other SanDisk products and I wouldn't recommend that you would either, but if your are swayed by the reviews, make sure you thoroughly test what you purchase before you actually need it.",
Performance and capacity were not in line with cost and expectations. These are most likely counterfeit or back door sales in my opinion. Very unsatisfied.,
I am very happy with the ease of set up and the voice control is fantastic It makes selecting a movie so much easier than the other pay for movie services.,
"As per other's instructions, I inserted it in a powered-off phone and let the phone format it (automatic, after a yes/no dialog). I removed it from the phone and copied  my old card onto it through a card reader on the PC (plus about 20 movies) and everything is working perfectly. Speeds seem outstanding; certainly, copying a 3GB HD movie I copied from my Blu-Ray disc took only a few minutes, even over USB 2.0.",
"I big problem I have been having lately is finding a trustworthy source for SD cards. They are manufactured in China and these rip off companies are selling fake cards at a competitive price, but don't be fooled. If the price seems unbelievable that is because you will end up with a card that is not only less capacity then you are paying for, but a lower class and sometimes a faulty card altogether.When it comes to storage, pay the extra cash to get something reliable. Like this SanDisk Ultra 64 GB SDXC Class 10 memory card. It is blazaing fast and works well in my HTC EVO LTE Android phone.Side note: This card brings my total phone storage capacity to 158 GB. That is 158 GB that I have full access to. 85 GB of which is synced to the cloud.",
Easy to use.non stick and bulit well.would buy again no question.hope it last longer than the last.only issue is it's longevity.Last one lasted less than 3 years.for that price it should last longer,
This is not like the Amazon Echo however this speaker is loud and sounds good...but you will lose bass if it's at max volume (not recommended if you like bass),
I would go for the Echo because you can talk to it. The tap you have to touch it before you can talk to it. The speaker is good though for it's size.,
"When you buy a memory card, what are you looking for? Additional storage, higher transfer rates, and good prices.  This card is often on Amazon's lightning deals and this is the second one I purchased! I use it in my Nokia 808, which is my phone and camera.  Storing 41MP photos needs a speedy drive, and this one really works wonders!  The additional space is also great for storage! The second one I bought for my laptop, it just stays in there in lieu of an SSD because my laptop only has an 80gb internal drive.  If it were possible, I would definitely install Windows to it, but this laptop will not boot from a memory card.Bottom Line:Need Space? Problem solved, 64gb is currently the max you can get.Need faster transfer rates? For a MICROsd card, it's about as fast as you can get (and if you can get faster, it'll cost a LOT more)Cost? Well, wait for a Lightning deal if it's too much, but the current price really is not bad.5 Stars.Additionally, the SD adapter works perfectly! Including the little lock switch to make it read only if you want.",
I've got a couple of these in varying sizes. I've had no problems and no complaints about speed. I always end up buying more because the prices are so low for what you get.,
"The product shipped fast and actually came in a few days early. I read about some people having problems with this card. When I got it, first thing I did was format it. Also make sure your device is compatible with SDHC cards. I have had no problems. Very fast read/write speeds. A little over 29 GB actually available for storage. I am pleased.",
"It's a giant, fast micro-SD card for your phone. It works and it's reasonably priced. I've swapped this card through the past 3 phones I've owned and it continues to serve me well on the road. You can bring along enough 1080p movies for a 20 hour flight (or several of them) and still have plenty of room left over.The only downside is that it isn't even more capacity. But really, 64gb is probably overkill.",
The micro card is excellent for its intended purpose. I bought several and have had no problems with them. That I don't like having to deal with cards of this size has absolutely no bearing on its performance or its rating. (I have never used them with their adapters and so cannot comment.),
"Bought 2 for me and my wife Samsung Galaxy S2 phones.  Took photos and video and there is no issues at all.  Based on my previous experience on similar products I got for DSLR and other cameras,  this thing should last as long as or longer than all my electronics.",
Purchased this for my Galaxy Note 3 and no problems.  It was recognized without error and seems to work fine.,
I got this to upgrade my tablet to 40GB with the micro SD card. The tablet is a Ainol AX1 with 8GB of storage. I thought i needed more storage for movies. Seems to work just fine.,
"I purchased this to add storage to my Samsung Galaxy Note 3... and it works GREAT!Fast speed, easy snap-in install.  Not a moment's problem.Highly recommend this SanDisk Ultra 32 GB Micro SD to anyone planning to use with Smartphone or Tablet.",
Does its job!,
Use it to store music and stuff in the cell phone...have had no problems or bad sectors.The included adapter is great for using it in the computer,
"Even thoug it does not meet the specification speed, is a great product, it does what it was intended for.",
"I bougth this micro SD card after some trubles with other that i got from Kingston, i can tell that SanDisk is other quality, this is the best, my i9300 phone can read a 64GB very fast, the dta transfer speed from my pc to my is amazing, if you are looking for additional storage to you phone, for music, pictures and other type of files, this is for you.Pros-Very good quality materials of construction-Amazing speedUpdate after one year this memory is damaged I can not delete or put new files on it, I can not format this memory, I tried to format with my phone, with my pc, with a camera and nothing, now this is like a 64gb cd, the data in the memory is only available to read but I can not move, or delete it, I bought this memory to be used to backup all my data of my android device but now is only a readable memory I can not write data on it any more, I hope sandisk make a better products in the future!!! Total disagree I will buy a Samsung memory card expected a better quality.",
"I ordered this card for a friend and had it shipped with prime. After about a week my friend still didn't have the card. OK, I called Amazon and they had a new card in the mail that day and overnight-ed it. Great service on Amazon's part!It's a micro SD card, what more can you say about it. If you don't know how to use one then you are just dumb and you should walk into traffic",
"good card of high quality material, nice design, new model. product brand name is famous n reliable. recommended, for good price...",
"I'm a music lover and like to carry my entire music collection around with me everywhere I go. That being said it takes up A LOT of space, enough to fill a 64gb memory card on its own (a lot of the files are FLAC format.) I was a little hesitant to buy the 128gb card when it came out recently because with the 64gb cards the first batch were pretty much defective with resulted in a recall. Me, learning of the recall after looking up the issues I was having had to return the card I bought. SanDisk took the 64gb card back without hesitation and was actually prepared to do it without the serial number (since I couldn't open my phone at the time because the case is screwed on.)Note to everyone:Quite a few applications don't fully support NTFS or newer file system formats such as exFAT. To use your SD card without issues you have to format it to FAT32 which IS possible even though its over 32GB. Use the &#34;Fat32Format&#34; tool made by Ridgecrop Consultants, there's a GUI (Graphical User Interface) version available for those unfamiliar with using the command line.------After receiving my new card I formatted it to fat32 since I use a lot of applications that aren't the norm and it's easier to use an older file system that is compatible with everything made after 1996. The transfer of files and swapping of cards was seamless, my computer's micro-sd card reader recognized it without trouble as well as my phone. So far everything is good and there's been no hiccups. Even Google Play has been crashing less when trying to browse my music collection.",
Great speeds and reliable so no complaints here! Has lasted a few months now in my smartphone which is longer than some other knockoff brands that I have received.,
"Trusted SanDisk for years.  No issues, works great.  Does exactly what is needed.  I use SanDisk in all my camera and phone gear.",
"My last san disc micro card stopped working randomly, and got this one to replace it...it is perfect. Its way faster than the last one. Good price too.",
"Very satisfying purchase.Needed to increase  the storage capacity  of my Core i5 Samsung Series 7 Slate PC which was EM equipped lwith a 128GB SSD.  This 64GB memory card fit the bill perfectly. Did my research. Cconfirmed a Micro SDxc card and  64GB capacity can  work in the memory card slot of my Windows 7 Pro slate device.  Purchased  the memory card at a very attractive price. ( Amazon was offering a daily deal at the same time period I needed the product)  Memory card arrived without delay.  Packaging was very siimple (worry free...for real).  Plugged  SD card in my slate. PC card slot.  Formatted card to exFAT  vs  NTFS ( after more research ).and I was ready to go.  Transferred my photos and music from SSD  to the SD card.  Freed up valuable  SSD real estate for OS use and my Slate PC is again  humming  with lot more  SSD space available. Plays back  music, video & photo slideshows smoothly from the card. Delivers on function.  Very  satisfied with purchase ..and highly recommended 5 stars no hesitation !...",
Storing my images and videos as it should on my Note 3. No issues here at all as some have stated. Possible they received a bad batch?,
"I wanted to upgrade my HTC Evo micro SD card. I found this SanDisk at a good price. I have had few SanDisks earlier and had no problems with it. I ordered and it was shipped fast. It comes with SD adapter and makes it usage as regular SD card. I unmounted the existing card from the phone, copied over the contents from one SD card to another using adapter and loaded up the new one. Works great. I didn't see a huge difference in speed, but may be I didn't run any speed tests or anything. I like the price for the brand and 32gb card. I will recommend it.",
I use this in my Canon digital SLR.  Has lots of memory and the quality of images are great.  No disappointments.,
"using this in my s3 and its great. movies , music and more picture taking . wat else is there to say",
"Sandisk cards seem to have the least write errors in my experience. This was at a great price too, so it is a win win.",
This was a very good buy for me and it helps me to store more information.  It also allow me to organize my pictures and music as well.,
"The card works like a charm with the GoPro Hero 3.  Pay attention though... it is about the size of a fingernail and could get lost very easily.  Also, keep track of the Adapter, as you'll need it to download the images.",
I'm not sure what to say other than that this product works as described by the manufacturer and seller of this product.,
"These are genuine Sandisk memory cards, but from a defective batch.  I lost all of my photos and videos taken on my phone over the last two years because the card had a catastrophic failure.  SanDisk reps informed me the batch was bad and they were aware of the problem.",
Es una reconocida marca y la calidad de sus productos tambi&eacute;n lo son. La velocidad para c&aacute;mares de alta definici&oacute;n es muy recomendada.It is a recognized brand and quality of their products are too. The speed for high definition Camar&eacute;s is highly recommended.,
64GB microSDX class 10 memory card. I use it as external storage for my Samsung Galaxy Note II phone. So far it has worked great.,
"I purchased this card on a daily lighting deal for my new Samsung Galaxy Note II. It was recognized without issues. I connected it with its adapter to my computer's card reader to transfer about 3Gb of data and the best consistent transfer rate (average) was roughly 13Mbps... That's less than %50 of the advertised transfer rate.To be fair, I've used the same external card reader with my Sony HX100 digital camera with an SD card (16Gb class 10) and I get double the transfer rate of what I've gotten for this card.Here is the setup:1- SD Adapter included with this card.2- External 12-in-1 USB 2.0 card reader connected to a USB 2.0 port on my PC3- Files transferred were of varying sizes.4- Transferred from 2TB Seagate X2 SATA3 HDD (connected to SATA2 port)5- Windows 8 Enterprise x64 (oh yah baby)The only excuse I give this card for its bad performance is the files were relatively small sizes but some of them were as large as 50Mb... This still does not justify the very low transfer rate.I am not really picky because this card will reside inside my super phone but still it does not justify the money paid for this card.I hope this will help others.",
"Since the wife is using it and it is not causing any problems, then it must be functioning normally. Looks good so far.",
Some reason this card (and a replacement card) did not work with my GoPro Hero 3+.....therefore I could only give the card a 3* instead of a 5......ive also read that many people are having the same problem with ALL brands of micro SD 64 gb cards.,
"This went into my new Samsung Galaxy Light cell phone to store my music files and my cell phone photos. Zero problems. These SD cards just work (until the don't). SanDisk is a top brand and I have no trouble recommending this. Look through the many dozens of other recommendations, too. Class 10 UHS-1 is one of the fastest protocols available currently.",
holds a lot of memory. slides right into my car cam with no problem and easy to get out as well,
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",

Inserted the card in my desktop computer, and the computer said that the card had to be reformatted before it could be used.  Tried to reformat it to NTFS, ex-fat, and fat32.

Works perfect in my HTC One V. No complaints. Love the amount of space in the tiny package. Fast as you need for a phone!,

"I got my first Kindle. This is a nice ebook reader. I'm going to jump right in and tell you what I found to be its Pros and Cons. Then I'm going to tell how it compares to its biggest competitor, the Barnes Noble Nook Simple Touch.Kindle's Pros:Great Screen: Many people do not find LCDs hard to read on (e.g. smartphones, tablets, Kindle Fire, Nook Color, etc.), but virtually everyone will find E-Ink easier to read, any time of day. Especially the newest E-Ink Pearl displays. They simply look like paper and ink. I have never experienced any eye strain reading E-Ink book readers, but I have with LCD based phone/tablet screens.Thin and Lightweight: This Kindle is thinner than any paperback and lighter too. This makes it very easy to hold in a sitting position, and for long periods too. It also makes it easy to transport in a purse, backpack, or messenger bag (or in luggage for traveling). Many people like to take a few books when travelling, and this Kindle lets you take as many as you want and adds virtually nothing to your travel burden.Good Value: Even without a touchscreen, the Kindle is a good value. It is a well-made product, it offers cloud storage of your books (and well it should, since it offers no ability to expand storage capacity with an add-in microSD card), the screen is excellent, Amazon is a dogged competitor in book pricing. The Kindle 4 is the best value of Amazon's E-Ink readers. Some may be tempted to get the version with the built-in light. If you can afford it, sure, go ahead. But let me point out you don't have to spend 20 for a fancy-schmancy book light. Your local dollar store has them for ... wait for it ... a buck.Read more",

There were a few issues with connectivity over the holidays, but for the past month it has been flawless. Very satisfied with purchase.",
A lot of people want big memory which is fine. But you need to look at speed class. This one is class 10. Which is great when your taking pictures or video. It will not freeze because it can move the MB/s fast enough. Lesser speed cards will freeze or will say waiting for camera and you will miss the moment. Its also a Sandisk which is a name you can trust when it come to memory cards.,
"Hi Everyone, Alexa is the best of the best. I feel like she knows me more and more each week. She is a STRONG speaker for my love of music. She knows like everything ever. I ask her crazy facts and she always responds with something. She does struggle a little with recent events. But that will get better with time. She is my home personal assistant and assists with managing my calendar. In a word. AWESOME!",
"This itty, bitty SD card packs a whole lot of punch!When I saw how small this was, I was blown away.65GB in something the size of my pinkey fingernail, AMAZING!I have used it on my camera and my phone.I would highly recommend this to anyone.",
Fun new product. Great gift idea especially if you aren't good with technology.,

For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more",
"This is the fifth e-ink Kindle reader that I've bought. My wife and I were early adopters of Kindle, and when we buy a new Kindle, the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line. I loved the original Paperwhite, with its small size, touch screen, front-lighting, and virtual keyboard. The all-new Paperwhite is a definite step up, and for me, it was worth the move, but others will have to decide for themselves. If you read a lot, and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink Kindles, it's definitely worth upgrading to the Paperwhite. If you have the original Paperwhite, the upgrade is well worth considering. Although I've only had the new Paperwhite a few hours, I'm already glad I upgraded. Here's a summary of my initial impressions of the new Paperwhite.SIZE: It's the same size as the original Paperwhite - 6.7x4.6x0.36. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.8 ounces to 7.3 ounces. The Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand, which is how I usually read. The really good news is that if you have a case for the original Paperwhite, it will also fit the new one (thank you, Amazon). If you buy a case, I highly recommend that the case include the magnetic AutoWake function. It's much easier to turn the Kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch.LIGHTING: The front-lighting is noticeably improved over the original Paperwhite, which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the LED lights were located. (It didn't bother me, but some readers were annoyed by that.) I couldn't see any shadows in the new Paperwhite, where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform. With the Paperwhite's front lighting, you'll never need a clip-on light, even in total darkness.Read more",
"I'm using this in a SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 16GB unlocked smartphone and the only problem is as you write more and more flies to the card it gets slower and slower to the point that you'll be so p.o at a crucial moment , say for example you want  to access a video  or doc , that when you do actually get your file you've lost  all faith in the card .So buy it for the capacity but always remember it's not reliable  for fast access.",
Works perfectly and has enough storage for many hours of recording.Could be the best one out there for the price.Recommend this one.,
"This device works in Galaxy S4 no problems, it woks perfectly and really I just can't get over that you can buy a 64GB storage device that is the size of my thumbnail, that will run programs from it for under $50.One day something like this will hold 64 TB. Crazy cool.",
Always happy with my Sandisk cards.  Used this one for my new Contour Roam.  Worked like a charm.....Awesome quality..Thanks Amazon!,
"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more",
"If you like the Kindle Fire HD then you will love the Kindle Fire HDX. The new device runs three times faster, is lighter in weight, and the battery lasts slightly longer. The sound quality on this device is excellent and the display quality is absolutely stunning. Below are some of the features to expect from the Fire HDX. BUILD QUALITY---There is NO blue haze on the 8.9 HDX.---The build quality is excellent.---Auto contrast is good (not buggy).---Operating system is very intuitive except after downloading free prime videos to watch offline. If you remove the videos from your Carousel then, from the video menu, you must go to the left side bar, and click *downloads* to see your videos. PRIME DOWNLOAD ISSUES (free video download limitations)Prime members can download selected Prime Instant Videos to watch when not connected to the internet. There are major restrictions imposed on prime videos as listed below.---Not all Prime titles are available for download.---Most popular prime titles are NOT available for download.---There is a max of 25 titles that can be downloaded free at any one time.---Prime titles have a viewing period.---Viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the video, or 15-30 days (which ever comes first).---After the viewing period expires you need to reconnect to the internet.---Titles can be downloaded to only two separate devices at a time.---If you exceed the device quota then you must delete one of the titles before adding to another device.---There is no way to know which titles can be downloaded unless you have the HDX (amazon does not place a banner on the titles other than to say PRIME).Read more",
This micro sd card works great in my galaxy s4. It doubled my storage space and is quick to respond. would definitely recommend to anyone who buys a new smart phone.,
"I chose this for it's size, both physically and virtually. I recently got a new phone that can support 64GB and because I have a lot of music photos and videos, this was a no-brainer, especially since it's rare to find any other 64GB micro SD, SanDisk is the only one I can find, but that's not a bad thing, I trust this brand. It's kind of hard to review a micro SD because if it works, it works, there's not much to it.",
i don't really know what to say - accept that it does the job - i use it with my SOny Action Cam - and so far so good - :),
"Best microSD card. SanDisk is a brand i trust for my SD and microSD card. Over the years, they have proven to be the most reliable and least expensive memory card sollution. I also bought the 64gb and you just can't beat the price or the quality.",
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
This was a gift for someone else that needed more memory space on there phone. I hope it works out for them.,
It looks like what's it's supposed to look like.  It does what's it's supposed to do.  I got it for quite a decent price and in timely manner.  #goodstuff,
I got a Samsung S3 and wanted to get the max amount of memory on it so I decided to get this memory card. I do not regret it you won't run out of memory easy. I have 7 1080p movies on it and I still have a whole lot of memory to spear. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.,
"Great item, good service from Best Buy. It is uncanny that new and unique products are introduced often.",
"I will rate this Amazon Tap a five stars when the application to make the Alexa commands become remote, instead of manually pressing the command button on the unit itself.",
I bought 2 of these.  They arrive before the due date and were in perfect shape. I installed one in an old smart phone and it is working again.  Good service.,
"Haven't had a chance to completely fill up the stick, but so far so good. I've taken my gopro with this in -10 below weather launching off jumps and occasionally take a beating.",
"I brought this for my new phone, the note 3. For me when it comes to any kinds of cards for camera, phones or any device that uses cards I trust SanDisk. I have them in my DSLR, my Go Pro Camera. I'm a professional photographer and I have never had a problem with scan disk cards. So whenever I'm in need of a SD Card, Or Micro SDXC this is the brand I go with.",
"I have to say upfront - I don't like coroporate, hermetically closed stuff like anything by Apple or in this case, Amazon. I like having devices on which I can put anything I want and use it. But...I was a fairly happy user of a Nook Touch for several years, but couldn't use all its functionalities since I live in Serbia. Then I lost the Nook and since no other devices can actually be fully used in Serbia (buying books with them, using their online capabilities) except the Kindle, and since no one except Amazon ships to Serbia, and since I've actually been a happy Amazon customer since 2005 over friends' accounts and since 2007 through my own, and since the Kindle definitely has the best technology - why not buy itSo I did. What I read in many reviews about the screen/light of the Paperwhite and similar devices was no problem with mine. The light disperses just fine, except a few black blotches (maybe you can see it in the picture) at the bottom of the screen, which are actually shadows of the black plastic casing and thus can't really be avoided. As you can see in the picture without the light - there are no blotches with light out.The Paperwhite's screen is just marvelous at 300 ppi, the touchscreen works just fine, the store works here in Serbia, and in these two days I've been using it, I'm a happy guy.I had to get the hang on how to make sideloaded books behave at least almost like Amazon books, but that's fine. That's the one thing I'd like to see Amazon do in some future upgrades: make the Kindle treat sideloaded books just like the ones bought from them directly, with sharing funcion (quotes and Goodreads) enabled and so on.The size is perfect, it sits very well in the hand, the light doesn't hurt the eyes in the dark (like the light on a tab does)... the packaging was fine, no problems there and what remains to be seen now is the battery life.So far, I can only recommend it.",
"Well since 16 GB is not enought for me I purchased this one specifically for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (Which by the way is far better than the iphone 5)... I have both so I can compare and I am not trolling... In any caseThe SanDisk 64gb works perfectly with the Note 2. I transferred the original info from my previous 16 gb sdcard to this in a heart beat. Now I have movies, music everything. Works Great.Dont understand how people can rate it with a 1... Product works as described 5/5",
"I bought this 64 GB unit for my new Samsung Galaxy S IV. I wanted the maximum size for music and the copious number of pictures i take of my kids and other things.I like the read and write speed on this card. I like the size but would have been happier with a bigger card but this is the max for my phone.Always happy with SanDisk, you will not be sorry you paid a little more.Edit: Should not have put ""they have never let me down"" in the title! 3 months in, I have been having problems with the SD card slot on my Galaxy S4. Not sure if it is the phone or the SD card moving in the slot. T-Mobile have sent me a new phone so we shall see.Edit 2: 4 Months in and I am having more problems with the same card. I received a new phone from T-Mobile and the same problem continues to occur. I have formatted the card twice and this gives a little time before the problem reoccurs. I have spoken to SanDisk and will call them again to have this card replaced. I will let you know how this goes.",
"Bought this to expand my HTC Sensation.  Still haven't loaded completely, and still not sure how well the sensation will organize 64gb of music.  Probably won't replace the iPod, but is an awesome little chip which adds tons of possibility to a otherwise great phone.  Didn't have any problems with formatting or size limits.",
"Works according to the camera requirements. Reads fast, writs fast, it's a good card! I though about buying the 32 gb card, but I found that you can actually move the pics from the camera to your iphone/ipad, so you actually don't need more capacity.",
"Yeah. Ultra Hot. I could not get any of my devices to recognize this card. When I finally was, using a USD reader, I tried to format it. It wouldn't format and burned my fingers when I removed it. Others have also posted this. Maybe they are not all bad, but many are. Perhaps they are counterfeit, I don't know. But the hassle of having to return it isn't worth the $10 you may save.",
"I can not say it is a bad MicroSD Card, but mine Stopped working after a few months of normal use.Every time I put it into my PC or Smartphone a message came up saying that I needed to format it, But when I click on format, it showed another message saying that it was unable to format it..... The one I purchased to replace it is a POLAROID which by the way is working better than I expected.While it lasted it was perfect.",
It is all you can expected for a 32GB SD card. I never tested the read/write speed but it never had a problem for music and videos.,
"SanDisk is well known for their microsd cards. I placed one of these 64GB cards in my Galaxy Note II and love all the extra storage on my phone for video, music, work docs, etc. Haven't had any issues with the card thus far and it has been working great in my Note II.",
"I am using the 64 GB card in a Galaxy Note II phone and have had the card working perfectly from March to October. The speeds were fast and it always worked flawlessly.Then one day I decided to protect my data prior to going to Europe by encryping the card in the phone.The encryption process went properly and took about 3 hours (as my card was filled with about 18 gb of mostly image files).However, the phone then slowed down considerably and it took up to 10 second to decrypt the card every time I woke the phone up the screen. Needless to say I didn't like that and decided to return the card back to decrypted state. I did the procedure of decrypting it back and when it was done, the card became urneadable. Attempting to format it in the phone as well as in the computer with various utilities programs did not help. The card showed those old folders being present despite multiple formats but I could neither access the files nor permanent write to the card. (The phone could save pictures to the card while it's powered on but after restaring the phone, the newly taken pictures were gone).I contacted SanDisk who graciously exchange the card which now work great again. I give the card 4 stars just because I don't know whether the experienced problem was due to the card or the phone. The SanDisk has shown itself to have great customer service and I really appreciate them exchanging the card. I will definitely not encrypt it anymore. When card works, it works super fast and reliably.",
"Love it, good quality good performance, great brand. Could not find better product for my money. Using it for a Samsung Galaxy S4 mini with zero complications.",
This speaker has great sound and is very easy to use.,
only works with cameras having a remote screw. Works well with Fuji X2. Red even makes it just fine but would like black.,

"What else can I say... this SanDisk 32 GB class 10 works like a charm in my Galaxy SII i9100 (unlocked). If you're upgrading from an old smaller microSD card, I did this:1. Create a .img file of the old microSD with HDD Raw Copy Tool (freeware)2. Recover the saved .img file in the new microSD card with HDD Raw Copy Tool* Since the old microSD had only 8 GB, the new microSD card will have only 8 GB D:3. Install Minitool Partition wizard (freeware) and choose the new microSD.4. Choose the Move/Resize option.5. Drag the space to the full size of the new microSD card6. Don't forget to Apply7.

SanDisk 16GB Micro SDHCWorks as advertised.Good Quality.Pretty inexpensive price considering.I would recommend it to anyone in need of a micro sd card.,

"It was just a few weeks ago that I was bemoaning the fact that I did not scoop up an Echo back when they were being released last year. Not only could it be had at nearly half off the current price, but it came with a voice remote and we could have had a year longer using this amazing device...Well, here I am, a year late to the game and I can now proudly say that I own both an Echo and this new little Tap! Can I just say that I am OBSESSED with all things Echo and Alexa. These are devices that you may not realize how much you'll use it until you've given them a try.I have been spending the last few years getting our home automated. I currently use a combination of Smartthings, IFTTT and Logitech Harmony to control the home. Alexa fits right into the middle of all that and gives us the ability to control our home via voice. For me, this is the killer feature. I can integrate all three parts of our home control right into Echo/Tap and make our house even smarter with very minimal setup.Read more",
I bought this to use in my Chromebook with a short SD card adapter.  I can transfer a 1 Gbt file from the SD card to my USB 3.0 flash drive in about a minute.,
"Packaging very secure, product is absolutely legitimate Sandisk card.29.7 GB available storage.[Normal for 32GB card] Amazon comes through again!Speed unknown, works fine in all my **stuff**..Addenda 9-19-13: Two received and working perfectly. The loss of 2.3 GB(32 to 29.7)explained by the data added when formatting the chip.  Seemsto be a legitimate 10 speed. VERY good MicroSDHC! The best!",
I got two of these for two NOKIA 822 Smart phones. Be sure and contact your provider to find out what is the largest chip your phone can handle?  SW,
I installed the memory in my new Galaxu S4 and it gave me plenty space. No worries anymore about lack of space to take pictures or video,
"I use it for my GoPro Hero 3 Silver Edition and it works perfectly, even with Protune! If you have a GoPro, this is probably a great SD card to start with.",
It works about 50% of the time when asking it a question.,
"its so much faster than normal sd's. I recommend this micro SD. it flies!the card reader was ok, tested it and worked but never really used it because its too big",
I the awesome I use it at work at lot its loud enough to enjoy any where,
"I had no problems transferring stuff over to it including 30 GB of songs.  It was much faster than offbrand.  I got this in 12/2012.update: 8/2013:  I got my wife a new samsung galaxy S4.  Her old phone would only do 720p video and didn't have a nice camera.  My wife is really into her photo's, so I was concerned it wouldn't keep up with the fancier camera.  After loading my now 33 GB of songs I got even more concerned in wouldn't keep up with the fancy new camera.  I bought one of the sandisk 64 GB extreme cards and was amazed at speed difference copying songs.  Due to prior problems with generic cards, I'll only buy sandisk in future.Nothing was wrong with the ultra card, it just didn't seem up to par to fully take advantage of the latest/greatest phone technology.  She's going to carry the old card in purse in case she fills first one.",
Currently using this in my tablet for my retro gaming and it works great. Haven't lost anything and speed works fine. I don't have a negative thing to say it.,
"I bought it for a Samsung s3 and had continuous problems of messages saying it wasn't connected, etc.  Replaced it wit the equivalent Trascend and never had a problem for the past several months.  It would work on a PC with ana adapater and then failed to format in any device so I had to RMA given the lifetime guarantee.  A hassle.",
Id say that this product is a steal! Now i am able to expand the storage size of my tablet to add more hd movies!,
"Very fast for taking full HD videos, and for transfering to the PC. Great quality, zero problems at all. A legit product from SanDisk!",
SanDisk quality shines through every time.I tried cheaper memory cards and have watched them fail over time.Even my oldest SanDisk flash stuff still all work years after purchasing and that's enough reason to pay more.,
Great value for the price.  Comes with an adaptor so it can be used in multiple types of devices.  I have had no issues with it and would recommend it.,
I really like this SD card. It's fast and it looks good. Great value too. What more can be said?,
I love the card unfortunately my note 2 does not allow app install on the SD therefore i have not been able to fully test this card,
"Has the basics covered: Secure hold, access to all ports, camera etc. Folds flat and holds magnetically if you want to read, but dangles freely if you want to use the camera. Feels secure.Better than expected: Other Kindle cases have been a bit insecure when used as stands, especially in portrait mode. This one is quite secure.Worse than expected: The textured front cover looks fine and feels nice but any slight stain from kids' food crumbs and the like stains immediately and due to the texturing cannot be wiped off. Even a bristled brush left some noticeable residue on the pale yellow one. Word of advice - unless you are both an OCD neat freak and very careful where you put this thing down, go for a darker color. Expensive - what do you expect for a new captive device",
"I cannot say if it's the SD card or the phone, but google sez it's the phone. Put your MP3s on this card for your Galaxy S3, and the result is a jumble of corrupted files. Yep, that's what I got. So, in fairness to SanDisk, I gave this card 4 stars, and a suggestion to y'all out there, get the 16gb card for your S3 instead.",
its a micro sd card and it works. What more can you ask for.I have one for each of my electronic devices.,
I use this in my Galaxy Note 3 and seems to work just fine.  I love having lots of memory and the price was good.,
Stopped working after a year and a half and lost a bunch of data. I have tried accessing the data useing multiple devices with no luck. Look elsewhere for an Micro SD card,
"This is an improvement over the Origami case we purchased for my husband's old 2013 Fire 7. He liked the case but the way it would collapse into several sections when trying to close was frustrating for me. This one has only 2 sections, so the folding issue is very minimal and it stands up well in both landscape and portrait as long as the tablet is in the correct orientation. (Just give the tablet a 180 if you can't get it to stand.) I don't usually like blue, but the marine blue of this cover and the tablet is gorgeous and they match perfectly. There is a nice texture to it that helps immensely with the grip as well as being very attractive. The cutouts are precise and allow for charging without removing the cover. I often have difficulty with close fitting hard plastic cases, but I had no trouble removing this one when I needed to. The only downside is that it does pick up a bit of lint at times. Overall, a very nice, classic case.",
I bought this for my GoPro camera and it works amazingly. No more lag and space for 1.5h of recording in the High ress. quality (not 4k) If you have a GoPro and need a memory card. Use this one.,
Bought this for my phone and it works without any flaws.,
This went in a new Asus tablet with the latest android system in it. It read and was used with no issues.,
"A lot of the other class 10 micro SD cards that came out seemed to have issues after a year of usage.  This one works great in my Galaxy S3.  I also like the color on the card, so much better than just black! So stylish. (except it's hiding inside the back of my phone)  Maybe I should make a clear window just where the micro SD card is.  So everyone knows I am using the SanDisk Ultra class 10. hmm",
"First, it is 64 GB. The volume is enough. In addition, it can fit every device for me. I love it.",
"Extremely wonderful tablet, it definitely gets the job done adaptes very well with everyday usage, good speed, nice display, and one I would definitely recommend to everyone!",
I purchased four (4) items from amazon and when I opened the box my 32gb memory card was missing. So rating this product is truly impossible,
"I got this great little remote and then spent half a day trying to get it to work properly. I was about to box it up and send it back because it only understood what I was saying about 10 of the time. I thought it was defective. Then I actually read the instructions that came in the box with it and you have to HOLD the button down while you speak. It's not a push then talk type affair like I expected. Once I got that figured out, it works great. Glad I bought it because I use it quite a bit from the bedroom. This will hold me over until my Dot is shipped. FYI, it doesn't come with the cradle any more, at least mine didn't.",
Brilliant Little Card  Good Transfer speeds highly recommend to all was exactly what i was looking for at a great price.,
"Echo Dot in my GMC Sierra Denali. At first she was just there with no support. She sat in that hole with no protection. Shifting, jiggling not knowing what can happen. There has to be something I can do. I looked and search and what I found is the Fabric Case for Alexa. This is it! A support she will be happy to wear. No more accidental popping out, no more shifting and readjusting, she is finally safe.",
It does what it is made to do. It is hard to believe so much memory can be stored in such a small chip.,
"I bought this SD card for my android phone thinking that a class 10 will be faster and more reliable than others. it turns out, the difference in class doesn't really matter at least for Android phones. didn't really worth the price difference",
Got here within a couple of days of ordering.  Easy to install and works great.  I wanted extra storage and this was right size for me.,
the transfer speed is good the picture quality is good it was shipped to me well packed but not over taped up,
"The item arrived in perfect shape and even included a sd adapter if you need it.  The card has worked just fine for me so far, so I have not complaints.",
"I placed this memory card in my Bluetooth speaker, I then loaded it up with different genders of music and it plays beatifully.",
This microsd card was as described by others and sandisk themselves. Very fast transfers and awesome price for it. Got it for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and love it!,
I confirm this works for my note on CM10 nightly. however it did not work upon arrival. It had to be re-formatted into FAT32. I used a small program fat32format through Google. I believe other programs would work too.,
"Not much to say, It is a memory card and does the job well. No problems at all with this card",
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones.

"I ordered these cards at a great price during black friday week/weekend.  I began loading some files (music, videos, pics, etc).  The first card worked without any problems.  The second card started giving me cyclic redundancy errors.  At first, I thought it was my hard drive that was failing, and tried to copy the same files to a flash drive which worked just fine.  Ok, maybe I received a dud, and tried with another card from my purchase.  Same results, cyclic redundancy error.  I started searching online, and found a utility via one of the reviews on Amazon called H2testw.  Ran the test on both cards, and it reported errors.  It also reported write speed of only 4MB/sec, which is way below advertised speeds.  These items were in retail packaging, and I remember reading about the bulk package items being fakes.  I guess the retail package cards aren't any better.I should have waited to do the refund because now I have to process the refund seperately.  I will test another card to see if I have better luck.  I wanted to leave a 1 star, but I gave 2 stars since 1 card worked so far.  I have 2 more to test.Very dissapointed because I was a fan of the Sandisk Ultra series for being reliable, but I guess they are cheaping out on quality to increase their profit.  I would have been extremely upset if I used these cards for anything important.",
"I had no issue using this with all of the above devices. It is still working strong and I trust SanDisk with all my gear including memory for DSLR use. Had not malfunctioned throughout many different uses and I trust this brand. Although it is more expensive as supposed to other brands, but they are worth extra in my opinion.",
"This works very well.  It is a class 10 memory card which ALL video cameras like.  Memory that is less than a class 6 plays back on some camcorders with a jerky playback.  Not with this memory chip.  Worth the money and at 64GB of storage lots of video time, photos and music storage.  The added value of the adapter is a plus.  This is a FIVE STAR product.

"If you like the Kindle Fire HD then you will love the Kindle Fire HDX. The new device runs three times faster, is lighter in weight, and the battery lasts slightly longer. The sound quality on this device is excellent and the display quality is absolutely stunning. Below are some of the features to expect from the Fire HDX. BUILD QUALITY---There is NO blue haze on the 8.9 HDX.---The build quality is excellent.---Auto contrast is good (not buggy).---Operating system is very intuitive except after downloading free prime videos to watch offline. If you remove the videos from your Carousel then, from the video menu, you must go to the left side bar, and click *downloads* to see your videos. PRIME DOWNLOAD ISSUES (free video download limitations)Prime members can download selected Prime Instant Videos to watch when not connected to the internet. There are major restrictions imposed on prime videos as listed below.---Not all Prime titles are available for download.---Most popular prime titles are NOT available for download.---There is a max of 25 titles that can be downloaded free at any one time.---Prime titles have a viewing period.---Viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the video, or 15-30 days (which ever comes first).---After the viewing period expires you need to reconnect to the internet.---Titles can be downloaded to only two separate devices at a time.---If you exceed the device quota then you must delete one of the titles before adding to another device.---There is no way to know which titles can be downloaded unless you have the HDX (amazon does not place a banner on the titles other than to say PRIME).Read more",
We bought 2 of these 1 from best buy and one from amazon and the amazon is still running the best buy craped out after 6 months,
"SanDisk is all I use. These are the backup microSDXCs for my two pro Canon cameras. They always work, never had one fail, and will store thousands of JPEGS on this card. I shoot in RAW on my CF card but simultaneously have a JPEG backup onto this card. I've never filled one even though I shoot thousands of photos on photo shoots.",
Works just fine in my video camera in the car.  And I saved over 15 bucks over Best Buy (which always tries to rip you off).,
"used for my phone to upgrade the storage, and works great. transfer speeds are faster than the network  can provide it with.",
"I guess I should be happy it failed after only 1 month, because I only lost 1 month's worth of pictures etc.  I bought 3 of these cards for my wife, son and I.  My wife's had a minor glitch, which went away with a reboot.  Mine had a minor glitch this morning, so I expected the reboot to fix it.  No a reboot caused my Motorola Defy XT to tell me the card was blank and needed to be formatted.  My laptop won't even recognize the card when I put the card in it's reader.  After a couple hours of looking for a way to fix it, I have only found that this is very common for this specific card.EDIT: I was very happy with Sandisk after calling them.  They did say there are compatibility issues with CLASS 10 cards and some of the Android phones, and verified my phone is one of them.  They offered free replacement with a card that would be certain not to have the same issue mine just had, and also to attempt recovery of my items from the card.  These are the reasons we buy sandisk in the first place.  They did recommend a Class 4 or lower card to me for this phone.I am leaving this as a 1 star, because people should be aware of compatibility issues this severe.2nd Edit:  As of March 12, this replacement card, that wasn't going to ""be susceptible to the same type of failure"" is losing apps etc.  I am giving this card up.  It has taken my phone and turned it into a device I cannot count on.",
This Amazon tap is awesome! Take Alexa outside! The sound quality is amazing and the price is right!,
Works great in my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S3. The only thing I found that didn't work was trying to transfer my files using a USB MicroSD card reader. When I used this USB Reader it copied my files but the phone didn't show them or couldn't write to the card. I had to put the microSDXC card in the phone and copy my files the slow way using the USB cable. The card does run hot when copying files to or from it. That would be normal I assume with it being Class 10. Best bang for the buck IMO. I would buy another one if I needed it!,
Nice controller,
Very enjoyable and easy for listening to music selections online. It sounds very good for it's size.,
Excellent product at a great price. I use it with Asus Transformer Pad 700 and it works great. Speed is high enough to  ply high definition video from it.,
"I purchased the Kindle Fire HD after returning a Lenovo Idea Pad. I have also had experience with iPads. Having said that, the Kindle Fire HD is an exceptional value for the money. The screen is FANTASTIC. Glare is kept to a minimum, colors a bright and vibrant, text is clear and easily read, movies look phenomenal in HD. Also, the sound quality and volume is bar-none for a device this size. The touch screen is responsive and shortcuts like tapping, double tapping, and pinch zoom work great. The size, weight and thickness are great for portability. It is easily slipped into the interior pocket of a jacket and takes up little room in a backpack. The weight and size makes it easy to hold with just one hand and the rubberized back panel is great for grip. The amazon store provides an almost unlimited supply, of books, movies, tv shows, music, magazines, and newspapers that is only improved with a subscription to amazon prime. Now, for the negatives. The power button and volume rocker are tough to find as they are flush with device and provide little tactile feedback when looking for them. I solved this problem by putting a thin strip of colored tape on the side of the device that has these buttons. The Amazon app store is very limited when compared to the full android app store. Hopefully the app library will only grow with the device's popularity. Apps from the full android store can be side loaded in a few easy steps but please be aware that not all apps will work with the kindle. Lastly, the carousel home screen is about as useful as a spoon is for cutting steak. Say you are finished reading a magazine and want to switch to another app, when you go back to the home screen, the magazine you just read and are done with is the first thing you see.Read more",
I used this SD card on my Nvidia Shield and works as advertised very quick transfer speeds.,
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model.

"These work great with Samsung S3 and Note 10.1. Ipads and Iphones got nothing on this, those users are amazed when they see all the parts manuals and technical documents and pictures I have at my fingertips (I have over 30gb of documentation and pdfs and pictures), all without some &#34;cloud&#34; that sucks your data especially when traveling out of the country, and with 32gb device memory still more than half free.",
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
"very fast and reliable, couldnt ask for a better product from a better company. unless you have a electronics lab in your home i dont think you could possible come up with such a beast.",
"Actually their is an EXTREME version but the price is about double and since I am not planning to shoot in 2.7 or 4K their was no need to pay more and get no improvement. Grabbed 2 of these, one for my father for his Great for my GoPro HERO 3+ Black Edition and both cards worked as expected. Works great with 1080p @ 60FPS in the GoPro and I imagine it probably would work for 2.7 and maybe it would work with 4K but again not bought with that intent so these perfectly suit our needs.",
"The Tap has been wonderful! We use it as a timer, for a weather update and for general music. The sound is terrific. I would recommend this unit. It is certainly easy to use - just a tap away.",
Great little micro sd card!  The 64 GB of storage is awesome.  Very dependable brand.  I have this brand  for other devices and always works like a charm!,
Not sure what the point is of reviewing a stanard 32G memory card.  Purchased for a tablet and works fine.,
This is pretty cheap I wish the 64GB one had been on sale but this one was priced at about 11 dollars so I can't argue. I have this in my Nokia Lumia 1520 and there is no lag I love this card should have purchased more.,
Great sound and functionality. Minimal kinks in programming. Love it for my bedroom.,
they work great with my phonei think i may have to buy lots more of this productmaybe 64gb,

Using this on a Galaxy S III. Works just fine with stock TouchWiz and custom ROMs. Haven't had any corruptions or lost files. Purchased it once it hit the $50-$60 range and looks like it'll stay there for a while.,
"Hello,Great card, great price. Plenty of speed and worked for...about a year. In fact, I wish it had stopped working a month earlier.It looks like Sandisk is out to make sure their cards stop working perfectly after the return window is up or something, because now on the end of December (Return window expired about 20 days ago) this thing only intermittently is recognized. It unmounts all the time in my phone and then gets remounted, and usually it doesn't even remount.While it was a good price, it was a good price for a name brand card that would have lasted longer than a year instead of Sandisk going &#34;ahaha got you good, now you have to buy another expensive name-brand card!&#34;Nope, I'll buy a cheaper alternative and it'll probably last longer. I still have some Kingston's going strong.",
"It fit, and it appears to workI have not yet had ANY issues with this cardhowever, I have only been using it for a few weeks...so my comment is based on my experience thus farIf my position changes, I will delete this postso, if you are reading this, then no problems has occurred thus far",
"I noticed amazon had the 'ultra' version for only a couple bucks more than the standard black version. And this one comes with an SD adapter in case I ever need it. I haven't bothered to speed test it since I'm using it for the tablet and don't feel like removing it from the tablet just for a test - but seems fast enough from my experience so far. Definitely faster than the regular black sandisk cards.From my experience with Sandisk products, their read/write speeds are much faster than they claim in their conservative estimates. It's not worth messing with their standard line if you can get 'ultra', 'extreme', or 'pro' for not much more.",
"I have read some of the previous reviews and you shouldn't believe everything that is written. First I'm a die hard Kindle user and love every single one I have owned.This one is incredibly light (weight). I bought the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 before this one and even though I loved it, it was pretty heavy. The screen resolution is incredible. It's crystal clear and just looks amazing. Now I kind of was debating waiting for the 8.9 to come out but this 7 inch is the prefect size to throw in my purse. I read previous reviews that stated there is a purple border around the edges of the book your reading. I don't have that and find that reading a book with this Kindle is easy on the eyes.I haven't used the Mayday button yet but I'm sure it's up to par with Amazon's wonderful customer service. I'm unsure what else to say but that you will be highly impressed with this Kindle.",
I knew buying sandisk i would get a great sd card and its super fast. I really like it in my phone.If you need a micro sd card this one will perform great and not let you down.,
I just installed it and working OK so far,
I use this with my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Tablet and it works Great. The SD card loads fast and I have had no issues.,
It helps the kids with questions it plays any music you like .,
For the price these cards provide a good compromise in terms of speed and cost.  I use them with IOGear USB 3.0 adapters and they work well in that capacity.,
"I purchased 3 of these Kindle kids edition tablets for my toddlers (ages 4,3,2 years old) And 1 non kids edition one for our older child for Easter. I was quite nervous that they'd break or the cases wouldn't be durable or that they wouldn't be able to use the apps they'd been using on my Samsung Tab S.After considering the price to purchase 3 of them and checking out the apps my husband and I were pretty sure we would purchase them. Then I came across the warranty. 2 year worry free guarantee! Are you kidding me I knew there had to be a catch, I couldn't find one and at that point we were convinced it would be a good investment.I ordered 3 (at the time pink and blue were our only color choices) So we have 1 pink and 2 blue. Which has caused a host of issues on the toddler level (identifying who's tablet is who's as you can imagine)They were easy to set up and create their own profiles and add apps to each of their tables . I love the unlimited freetime, they've had their tables for a few months now and can completely work them themselves and download the apps/movies/books that they want. I don't have to do it for them (with the exception of my 2 year old of course). I was able to link our Disney movies anywhere account with our Amazon account and now they can access all of our Disney digital movies on their tables! Which was a huge win for us! I do wish that Amazon could figure out a way for us to be able to link our Ultraviolet movies, it's a huge bummer that Amazon doesn't offer any app to make that possible. I also love that I can login to my Amazon account and send apps/movies etc to their tablets as I see fit, I can locate and page their tables when they are misplaced and remote lock them if I need to .Read more",
After a long research about the SD cards. I came across this deal. I wanted an SD card for my new Samsung Note 3. None of the review was talking about Note 3. Most of the reviews were either about note 2 or S4.A few reviews were talking about possible problem of not able to recognize the card and getting into the cycle where you have to call SanDisk. I was not sure to go for it or not. Although choices were very thin. Samsung cards were way out of my budget.So I decided to take a chance and I am happy that I did.It's working smoothly. No need to format. Just works great. One star for not exactly 64 GB. It shows up 59GB.I will again update this post after 1 month. When I will really sure it has no problem,
I purchased this product for my Sony Camera. Even though its micro SD it comes with a regular SD enclosure. It reads and writes fast and can hold several hundred images.,
No complains here.  Awesome cards with great performance.  No degradation in speeds so far as well as no bad sectors.,

Bought this to download more songs and music from spotify for my phone. Totally worth having the extra space since spotify won't save songs to your phones internal storage.,
"I got this because I just couldn't pass up the deal, $17.99. It has been incredibly fast in my HTC Sensation 4g. Pictures are taken and saved instantaneously. Only had it a few days, but have been very happy. Shipping was fast and the packaging was easy to open which is always great in my book. Only issue I had was I had to format it on my computer first before my phone was able to recognize it.",
Gift for my wife to listen to her music when she's sewing plus being able to purchase supplies as she runs out.,
Great card. Works with my gopro and Canon 1D,
I bought two of these for our new telephones. They work fine and were just what we needed if we have extra pictures on the phones. Pictures do take up a lot of room but now we don't have to worry about running out of room.,
This item is exactly what I was looking for. It is a perfect size for home or travel. It is very loud for its size.,
Works great as advertised.  No problem with formatting or anything.  Appears to be class 10 as advertised.  Thanks a bunch!,

Popped in the card, and I was happy taking pictures, saving files, and living life.Fast forward two months later, and all of a sudden, the card stops functioning. My phone won't read it any more. My computer won't read it either. Submitted a ticket to Sandisk. Hopefully I can get a replacement that actually works.Thank goodness I saved all my photos on Dropbox.",
"fast. however, im not sure if this card case is any more water proof than a normal card. i have been told all of them are water proof. i think this card is faster than several others i use though",
Compact size is helpful and the transfer speed is quite good.  Highly recommend this for people who have large storage requirements.,
I bought this to go into the new Samsung Galaxy Note 8 tablet I bought. Works like a charm and big enough to hold my data.,
"I have not had such a reliable speaker before. It is so easy to charge, and so easy to start playing songs right away. With Alexa, you can access information quicker than pulling out your phone, unlocking it, and pulling up Google.com. Love it.",
The card was put into my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.0 7 and worked great right from the start.  I haven't had any issues with it whatsoever.,
"This SanDisk UHS-1 TF Card is in good quality.However, it is not working as fast as the Class 10 standard. For operating a series of 4KB files, it can only read at ~2.6MB/s and write at 1.5MB/s.Compared to the SAMSUNG UHS-1 microsd, the SAMSUNG UHS-1 card can at least process 5MB of 4KB files per second, either reading or writing. For reading/writing giant files, This Sandisk card can reach &#62;30MB/S for reading and &#62;15MB/s for writing, which is acceptable for this price, but still a bit lower than SAMSUNG.",
SanDisk Ultra 16 GB MicroSDHC Class work the best in my dash cams... I bought a Mobile Micro SD Reader to use to read the small cards and it too work great ..,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
Plug and play!  Stuck it in my phone and within seconds it was ready to go!  Great way to add extra memory for those of us who can use them in our phones!,
I have used SanDisk memory cards in the past and never had a problem with them so it is worthwhile to buy a brand name.,
just okay! Product was for my girlfriend. Doesn't appear she uses it much except to steam music. Most of the questions I ask it I get nothing. I like Siri better.,
"People often ask me about bargain-basement pricing on no-name brands of media, and you know I just have to cite my own experiences with cheap media, and it's just that, cheap media, prone to failure or worse if it's a complex format as this one is, the SDXC format. They have crammed a TON of memory modules in that little bujgger, you know? I say go with experience, go with a leader in the field, so there's pretty much SanDisk at the top of the heap, and the rest trail far, far behind in volume and precision assembly techniques...so I vote for SanDisk every time, and unless my experience is changed  by some anomaly I'll keep on recommending SanDisk above all others.It's rated at 40MB/sec write speed, which is enough to keep up with even the fastest real camera or phone camera out there in the wild, and it certainly keeps up with my Samsung Note 3's 13-mega-pixel rocket camera, one that shoots up to 8fps in burst mode taking certain shots, so if it works for that camera perfect, chances are it will work for your setup great also!Buying the SanDisk memory module costs what, $5-$7 more than the others max, right? I say buy this one here, it's a winner in all respects.Wavey Davey 1-12-2014",

"Sling is simply awesome and so is the Amazon Tap!! My tap arrived this morning along with this sling and I am currently testing both products out as we speak!! This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.) I love the bright and vibrant colors6.) Silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging7.) Doesn't adversely affect sound qualityOverall: I do feel 20 for the sling is a little high but for the protection it provides my brand new tap, I very happy with it.. I didn't buy my tap to sit still at home..Read more",

Great Bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of Alexa,
I use this everyday with my Microsoft Surface and I'm very happy. No issues and great speed. Wish the prices would drop even more though.,
Don't even waste your time buying this memory card. 64GB is written on it but its actually even less than 3GB that's in it.i have never experienced such deception.i had tried loading my pics and music and other data on it from day one but no matter what i did i won't take more than 3GB of data. i didn't realise till i read other stories of similar memory cards that will state 64GB but would contain a smaller memory capacity often times even less than 10GB.i bought this card for $49.what a big waste!!now i am so scared of buying memory cards on amazon or online elsewhere.i wouldn't dear it again!it was in a sealed  sanddisk packet so i was thinking it must be original.Alas!it was a big  waste!i have lost confidence in buying memory card on amazon.,
I recently upgrade my cellphone to the Samsung Galaxy Note II super phone and needed/wanted a larger memory card.  This unit is much better than I could've every ask for with it performance and reliability.,
"Works! And why should I write more..... damn it! Eleven more words... finally am done with this, CRAP!! THREE MORE WORDS??",
Bought this to go with my Samsung Tab 2 7.0 tablet. Even though the tablet indicates that it can only take up to a 32Gb card. This 64 Gb worked like a charm. Now there is plenty of storage space for videos and music. Recommended,
Used this in my old phone and it works great. Quick with transfer rates and loved it for the short amount of time I used it. Will probably use it for something else like a camera or something.,
"I have had this micro-SDHC card for about 4 months now and I have had no problems with it. I had previously been using a similar 32 GB card in my HTC Evo, but upgraded to 64 GB when I got the Samsung Galaxy S4. I've noticed no issues with speed or reliability.",
"Spent over $50 and the thing came fast and didn't work.  Neither my computer nor my phone could read it or format it.  I have had plenty of memory cards, so I know to unmount it with software.  Odds are yours will be fine, mine sucked,",
"Do you need memory? This is 32GB of it in a MicroSDHC package. If that is the format you need and if this is selling at a price you like, then just get it and get on with your day. You've probably got better things, like that old episode of Gunsmoke you've been meaning to get to, or a nice walk along a cliff face. Possibly even something else. The point is that memory shopping shouldn't take you a long time. You should just do it. The amount of time it's taken you to read this is way more time than one should ever have to invest in considering a memory purchase. Have a lovely mid-to-late-morning, whenever that might next occur in your vicinity. Cheers.",
"Plugged in and worked out of the box in my Samsung Note 2 (Verizon).  Using an app to test the speed while it's in my Note, was hitting 8 - 15 mb/s for writing (avg high 8s), consistently in the 10mb/s for reading, so this seems like a legit class 10, and I don't think the write test really worked the greatest for whatever reason.  I'm with WinXP still, but to anyone else wondering, the exfat format the card comes in is what you want, don't format to fat32 if you computer can't read it, your phone/tablet/etc. most likely will read it fine.",
"Echo Dot in my GMC Sierra Denali. At first she was just there with no support. She sat in that hole with no protection. Shifting, jiggling not knowing what can happen. There has to be something I can do. I looked and search and what I found is the Fabric Case for Alexa. This is it! A support she will be happy to wear. No more accidental popping out, no more shifting and readjusting, she is finally safe.",
"I use it in my Sansa Clip Zip 8GB MP3 player and now I have 40GB for music.The included adapter allows me to remove the card from my player and add and subtract music using a standard card reader on my computer without having to plug in my MP3 player.When I'm done I slip the micro card back into the player, let the MP3 player refresh itself, and I'm good to go.This card is a class 10 unit so it's also good for expansion ports on Video cameras as well.-v-",
"I bought this for my new camera, and the price is incredible. I am a big fan of SanDisk when it comes to memory cards, so of course, I bought one for my camera, but was unsure about it fitting in my new camera (Samsung wb30f). Turns out, it fits, and the storage capacity is incredible. I am a picture lover, so whenever I am able to take pictures, I do. This gave me over 4,000 pictures (maybe even more, I can't remember). Great price, great storage capacity... can't go wrong",

"Bought a refurbished kindle and literally after one month of owning it the device started to freeze. I had to reboot it multiple times and then it would start working. Went on a trip and it worked as it should but as soon as I returned the battery died and I charged it over night and the next morning the screen was frozen with the character reading a book under a tree. I tried all rebooting methods (20 seconds, 40 seconds, 1 minute) and nothing. Called customer service and was on the phone for an hour. Eventually they said that they could only give me 35 off the next purchase of a new kindle. I was pretty bummed out that a refurbished product of their own was not backed by them. I ended up buying a new kindle with the discount they gave me but should have just went with a new one to begin with since I ended up spending the same amount of money and had way more of a headache to deal with. Now I have to figure out what to do with this new Kindle Paper Weight that I have.",
"Nothing really to say, except for excellent memory, fast and efficient. Can't go wrong with Sandisk. Using it for my Acer Iconia Tab, works like a charm. Thanks.",
good scan disk but the wrong one for my camera I needed a class 6 this class 10 locks up for no reason and even will lock up my computer when it does..,
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",
"I have nothing bad to say about this product. the packaging indicated that it was new, never tampered with. it came in the mail on time and I have had no issues with the card overheating like some other reviews have mentioned. I like that fact that now I have 16GB of space and this means I can have more pictures and home movies on my phone to share. Also music for when I'm working out. Great buy and for the price I really like it. I recommend it and will be buying one more for another phone.",
"I purchased this card to use in my ContourROAM2 and it works great.  All I had to do was put the card in the camera, format it, and I was good to go.  It allows me to easily record hours of 720p/60fps video without running out of space or slowing down.",
"I carry a ton of digital content with me on my phone and never want to run out of space.  This is a very fast Micro SD Card and gives me 75 GB of usable space on my Samsung Galaxy Note II.  I can take 20 pictures in about 5 seconds while listening to music.Fast, efficient and tons of storage ... who can ask for more!BillH",
"I like the that this is small  but holds a lot of memory and fits in the adapter, I have yet to find anything bad about these kind of memory.  I have to have this kind as some of electronic equip require use of a mini",
"What can I say.. It's a SanDisk.. Adapter works well, fits great in my tablet, 32 GB is a lot of space!",
I upgraded to this after the price dropped. I originally had a 16gig sandisk card and it was in my mytouch 4g. I found toward my mytouch 4g's end of life that space is running low. So when I got my Galaxy S3 I bought this card. It works flawlessly. I highly recommend it. Now errors what so ever. Super fast transfer rate.,
"I bought this memory card for my Galaxy Note 8. It's a SanDisk and worked great. The card was recognized quickly and I put all my music, videos and other files on it to save room for my internal memory. The price was also very good.",
"I only ever use SanDisk and have never had a problem, This is for my Wife's new 1st smartphone, so needed a class 10 and Amazon always has the best price, either in the US or Amazon UK",
"Sandisk is the best brand in my oppinion. 32GB is a great size to put music, video etc. Recommend it!",
Sound quality is amazing. I really like the ability to take this on the go. Downside. I wish I didn't have to press the button to talk and to wake the product up,
So far so good. No problems using this with a Nook HD even though it's Class 10. This includes playing downloaded videos.,
"Lot of questions about this memory card fitting the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 tablet.  It fits and works no problem at all. The only thing is that after installing, instead of showing 64GB available, it only shows 59GB.Tried formatting the card but with same results.Have no idea if this is a limit set by the the Galaxy Tab 3 tablet, or is it just &#34;normal&#34; to buy 64GB and get less than that.As this is surely not a problem coming from the Sandisk memory card, my rating is a 5-STAR.  Excellent price, works great, and very quick delivery.",
"With prices of tech items always dropping, getting the bleeding edge stuff usually costs a bit more. Thanks to Amazon and the ability to find deals like this, it was worth while getting the 64GB micro SDXC for my phone. I removed the 32GB I had in there for my Phantom 2 vIsion that had shipped with only a 4 GB unit.  Class 10 is where you want to be when using this for any video recording and you can always count on SanDisk for quality!",
"I'm not a heavy user of data but enough that my pictures and music videos wouldn't fit on the factory 4 gig card. You can never have enough memory as it gets used up quick. It has the advertised memory capacity rating and has improved speed on my smartphone and tablet when moving pictures and videos to different folders. No lag compared to the cheap factory memory card. Buy the better card the first time, you won't be regretting it later. Would recommend and buy again",
"its Works fine for me, keep the main memory of my cell pone free for OS. A lot of space for pics, music and many other stuffs.",
What can you say? It works like advertised and has a flair for its design. Fantastic for my GoPro Here 3. Now I just have to get more!,
I have always had good success with SanDisk and this one didn't let me down. I use it in my Camone POV and it works well.,
"works like a charm...expand my tablet capacity and now I have lots of space for apps, music and videos without worries",
I use this with my samsung galaxy note 3 and it performs pretty darn well. Write and read speed safe good and it stores all my photos no prob.,
Put it in my Note 3 and it works. No hassles. Phone recognized it and started using it immediately. What else is there to say?,
"I can't say that the applications are loading faster, but I can definitely say that videos and music load much faster in my phone now. I didn't have to reformat the card or anything, just transferred all DATA from old card to this one and popped it in. Considering the small price difference, I'd recommend getting a faster card for sure.",
"It's a pretty cheap card and has a good amount of storage, but it has fairly slow write performance. Some competitors' MicroSD cards offer much faster performance for similar prices.",
"it has it all, I got at great price....but speed, and reliability are the strenghts of this thing. USing it on a GN 8.0 and performs",
"works great, i trust SanDisk for quality.  I would recommend this sd card to anyone who is looking for a large storage card for videos.",
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",
"I use this in my Note II. I love it. I have all of my music, photos, and extras on it. This is not my first. I always try and by at least a class 10. I am not doing the test that others are. My pictures seem fast, the transfer speed is within reason. The price was just over $20 with Prime shipping. I would by it again in a heartbeat. In fact, I was probably be buying the 64 soon.",
"If you're reading reviews of the new 3rd generation Paperwhite, you're likely considering buying one. If so, you're probably in one of these categories:* Never owned a Kindle e-ink reader* Own an older Kindle e-ink reader, but not a Paperwhite* Own a first or second generation PaperwhiteI'll save my opinion on whether the new Paperwhite 3 is worth buying until the end of my review. (But I will say this: They've taken a great product and made it even better.) First, here's a comparison of the new Paperwhite with the second generation Paperwhite (comparisons are for the wi-fi models):Second Generation Paperwhite (2013)-------------------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.3 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 212 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: TouchscreenNumber of fonts: 6Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lightingAll-New Paperwhite (2015)------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.2 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: TouchscreenNumber of fonts: 7Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lightingNote that the physical size is identical to the older Paperwhite, so covers and sleeves that worked with the older Paperwhites are still usable (thank you, Amazon). The most obvious difference is the screen resolution: 300 pixels per inch is a major jump from the 212 pixels per inch in the older Paperwhites.Read more",
So far haven't got any issues. I'm using it to record video with my GoPro and it works fine. I'm also considering buying another one for my cellphone :-),
"I bought this card and it worked OK, at first. After about three weeks I noticed that some images were not showing up, a week later it began to loose everything. My Note 2 was failing to recognize it, inserted into the adapter and my comp could see it but not read all the files. Multiple formats by either the comp or Note 2 did not fix the problem, even tried some tools that I used for my DSLR, still no-go.This could just be a batch problem as the card looks legit and was fast in the beginning.",
I have a couple of these and have had no problems with them at all.  They seem to be fast and supply the full advertised memory capacity.,
I've been using this for a couple weeks in my Galaxy Note 2 with no problems and Gallery performance (which is primary use for extra storage) has been great.,
works great! what else can i say?,
Great micro SD card for smartphones or other products. I wanted something with a high transfer rate so that taking HD video there would be no lag.,
"Came in genuine retail packaging, works great with my camera.  Works great with my computer.  I like the colors, it makes it easier to find in my dark camera bag where the tiny black ones get lost in the fabric.",
I really don't know what to think about this I got it thinking it would solve my memory problems but that's not the case turns out you can only put certain things on this and of course none of the thingsthat are eating up your memory on.your will go there is a way to swap your internal memory for your external card but it's not easy and you have to root  your phone,
"It's been a month now with this SDCard in my phone.  I transfer an average of 3GB of data to and from the device per week.  The SDCard is holding just fine.  Where most tend to crap out or cause problems, this has yet to do it.",
"Perfect card for so many uses, holds a lot, no skips or blips. Nice quality at an affordable price, never had a problem with SanDisk and this one is no different.",
I use the card with GoPro Black Edition and it is just enough to record some action while horse riding. I have always used SanDisk as recording cards and I am happy with the quality I get.,
"I purchased this Ultra MicroSDHC Class 10 card for my media player. I wanted to replace my 4GB cardwith this one so I could store more music. I like to have a wide range of music to pick from when I amon vacation or traveling on an airplane long distances. I think I may have bought too much.This card is advertised as water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof and shock proof. I will have totake their word for it. I am not going to test it.Just for fun I put the 16GB MicroSDHC disc (30MB/s Read Speed) into its provided adapter and used itin my cheapo cheapo Toshiba Camileo HD movie camera. Even at the Full High Definition resolution of1080p/30fps this disc performed very well. No stuttering, no missed frames and all this under low lightconditions. Nice. Very Nice. Those are big files at Full HD resolution. Read on...This card is 'USH-1' enabled which means it is the fastest card available (allegedly) and should reachup to a bus interface speed of 104 MB/s; if the electronic device you are using requires it. Of courseif your card reader or device does not support that speed you will be transferring data at your usualspeed. Sort of like saying it is backward compatible but don't expect blazing speeds. You can feeddata through only so fast.Transferring RAW photos and a Full HD digital film can take a lot of time to transfer. Those are hugefiles to transfer so the USH-I enabled disc is perfect for that purpose. They are working on USH-IIwhich is supposed to allow up to 300MB/s transfers. Talk about instant gratification, we are aboutthere.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here is a guide by the 'SD Association' with regard to Class ratings and video applications:> Class 2 for SD video recording> Class 4 and 6 for high-definition video (HD) to Full HD video recording,> Class 10 for Full HD video recording and consecutive recording of HD stills> UHS Speed Grade 1 for real-time broadcasts and large HD video files> UHS Speed Grade 3 for 4K video files-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------USH-I overkill for a media player? Probably, but for the price it was a terrific deal to get a Class 10USH-1 enabled card and have the flexibility to use it in a variety of my electronic devices. Hmm. Onsecond thought I may just keep this card for the movie camera and get another ""slower"" one for mymedia player.As usual I have had no problems with this card. Works well, in or out of the adapter, and seems verytough in it's construction. 5 stars for this little power house of a micro card.",
Fits greatly with the device and easy to use. The fabric makes it look cool.,
"I've had this card for some time now and I've only had one problem with it and I believe that problem to be with my phone. The card's formatting became corrupted and while I could still copy to and from using my computer, my phone didn't recognize the card. Copying the data off, formatting the card, and copying the data back onto it fixed the issue. It's really nice to have 64GB's of extra data storage on my phone.",
I bought this card for my Gopro hero3+ and it was worked fine. Some people said they have problems with the cards in the new gopros but I have had no such problems. The micro card works with anything that also takes standard cards due to the included adapter.,
Good value. It has great speed and memory for the purpose it serves. I wish my memory was this good.,
"Wow! Fast memory card. I bought this for my new GoPro Hero 3. Great performance for full HD video.Shipping was fast, and nice communication on shipping and estimated arrival time.The SD Card adaptor works perfect in my full sized SD reader built in my laptop.Transfer speeds were blazing and read speeds are amazing.SanDisk is the best, really worth buy the top end class 10 micro SD card.If you doing HD video this is the card for you. Video is demanding, so youneed a SD Card that can keep up.In Hawaii we play hard, and the GoPro and SanDisk card have been working flawless at full 1080p60 video.",
"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more",
"I thought this was a sure winner from the average 4.5+ rating with thousands of reviews.  But if you notice the bad reviews involve the card becoming unreliable after a couple weeks of use. Typically people write reviews shortly after receiving the product.  My card worked fine for 2 weeks and then started having problems.  I re-formatted the card, re-inserted in the phone, removed the battery, every trick I could read about but the card still remained unreliable and the phone was thinking it was being removed at random times.  So I stuck my olders, slower 8GB microSD card in, worked fine.I suspect one or both is happening with this card:(a) Some cards are defective but it takes some usage for them to start failing to where the user notices.(b) For some reason, this brand of card doesn't like certain devices, like my Samsung Galaxy S3My guess is I got a lemon, but I'm not chancing it to getting another one and will just move on to another reputable brand.""You get what you pay for"" may be applicable here.  But a lot of others did have success with this card.  So YMMV.",
"I have always had good luck with SanDisk products and am pleased with this memory, reliable and looks cool too.",
The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond. Sounds great when playing music,
Added this to my Microsoft Surface RT tablet and it works perfectly and is extremely fast. Perfect for storing videos!,
"This was a great price for this card, and they are not cheap made. Save several $$$ buying form Amazon, the local stores was a lot higher...",
Great product and really protects the tablet.,
"Bought this to add storage to a Sansa Fuze MP3 player.The card formatted correctly and works quite smoothly with the device.I also tried it using the adapter, in my Kodak digital camera and it was recognized instantly.  Pictures were saved quickly, allowing the camera to shoot again without undue delay.",
"I got this to upgrade my surface pro 2's storage and it works nicely, what do I store on it? Bunch of MP3's and games on steam.It works well, the games run fine, boot pretty quick, the one issues I had was installing the games, sometimes the card would vanish from the drive and I'd have to pop it in and out to get it to go again, however I feel like that could be software related as nothing like that happened while playing a game.Best idea is to install the game on the surface, move the files over manually to the card, &#34;tell steam to uninstall the game&#34; to erase it from the list, then hit install, point it to the folder on the card, then it'll spot the files, download only a few things and bam, it works.About the card itself, I wouldn't rely on multitasking off this thing, as it's not meant for that- as in if you're playing music off this card, do not install a game at the same time. It's fast at 1 thing, not many.",
I purchased this memory card to expand the storage on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. After installation my Note 2 recognized the card and I've been using it to store images and music without any issues.,
"Works flawlessly, never had any problems with it and I've moved data on and off of it constantly.",
With this you have someone to talk to and answers you.,
This is just great. but the damned thing is really small. I had one before but I put it down and lost it for good.,
"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",
I would recommend this item to anyone looking to upgrade to a 64gb memory card whether for your phone or camera.,
"When I placed this in my Galaxy S4 phone it read it right away at 29.7 GB. Which is expected to loose a few GB. I transferred file from my old card and it was done fast. Although I didn't have large files to start with. I had been looking for a large card and this one fits the bill. The other reviews helped sway my choice. I would recommend this card, so far no issues.",
"Ok first things first, I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap.Now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the Tap was voice enabled like the Echo. I happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through. Because the Echo is not meant to be a mobile device. It generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have. But the Tap is meant to be mobile, and therefore I am happy it's not a Voice command device. I would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it. So I actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature. I have the Echo on my kitchen counter and the Tap in my Studio office. And when I leave my office I just grab it and go.I bought this on sale for 89 and I went to the store and listened to many Bluetooth speakers. And while yes the charge 3 sounds better, all the charge 3 can do is be a Bluetooth speaker. While the Tap is so much more for less . And the Tap sounds Great. After looking online I was a little nervous that it would not sound that great, but I was 100 wrong about that. There is no other product out there for 89 that sounds this good and can do what the Tap does.I was not paid or given a Tap to write this review. I'm just a consumer who was it the market for a Bluetooth speaker, and I could not be happier with my choice.Also if you buy this device buy the Amazon sling as well. Trust me you will want it. And honestly I am again happy I got the one that covers the bottom of the Tap. Because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink I would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed.That's it, that's all. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!",
"Don't get ripped off buying the same card direct from GoPro, buy it here for less; then you can use the money you saved to buy an extra battery since the Hero 3 battery life sucks.I have a few of these in the Hero 3 Black Edition and it works great on all recording formats and speeds, even the highest resolution ones that require full use of the card's 10 MB/sec rating.  They're very fast to copy files off of into the computer as well.  I haven't benchmarked them because other reviews already have that information, but they're certainly much faster than the old class 4 cards I use for my Hero 2 cameras.I would recommend formatting upon arrival; I did have one initial issue with one of these which formatting resolved.  It's worked fine since, with numerous uses, so I think it was just a missed QC check at the factory.  It hasn't had the heat issue others have mentioned with regard to the few defective ones people have received and has worked flawlessly since so I'm not worried about it at this point.",
"initially bought for a tablet, ended up using in my nikon camera. More storage, so I can't complain! Sandisk has always been a high quality and dependable storage solution for my electronics.",
Great Price,
"I pre-ordered this for my wife mostly to use as a Kindle E-reader as I figured the tablet would be slow and the display would be less than impressive. I was wrong. What a bargain this little beauty is! This model cost 49.00 but it comes with ad's displayed on the lock screen when your tablet is dormant. Once your screen times out, they disappear. You can pay 15.00 up front to get an ad free version so I assumed to unlock the tablet I'd have to spend 15 to 30 seconds looking at an ad for Amazon Prime, or a product from the daily specials section of Amazon.com I abstained from paying for Ad removal and was pleasantly surprised to find that the ads are only on the lock screen and that as soon as I unlock the tablet they disappear immediately.Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5 phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look greatPrice - it's a 50.Read more",
What else can I say other than the price is right. The quality is out of this earth's modern technology. Pair this baby up with an Android and you got yourself and unstoppable memory machine.,
"Just bought 2 new windows cell phones, and of course wanted as much storage capacity possible. So far no problems with the card at all, and do not foresee any.",
Where else can you get legitimate micro sdhc 32 GB memory cards for this price. The speed is 30 MB/s. Fast low cost 32 GB. Cannot go wrong. Name brand. San disk. I got ripped off buying imitation unpackaged memory cards that only worked days.,
"As has been the case for years, Amazon sloooowwwwly adds new changes and features to the Kindle. This one is no exception. If you've used a Kindle in the past, you're not going to notice much of a change with this one, but since there are some minor upgrades and so forth, I'll briefly go over them:*** SCREEN ***The new Kindle is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish with the slightly gray/off-white paper looking background. It's certainly not bright white, but it's also not LCD looking (dark gray.) It does NOT have buttons for page-turning as the older generations do. If you simply must have the page-turning buttons, please search for the older Kindles that offer that. One last thing regarding the screen: this is not a Kindle PaperWhite or Voyage where you have a back-lit screen... this has an unlit, off-white Kindle screen. I will say, the text is noticeably crisper and bolder than I've seen with previous generation Kindles and I believe that's because Amazon is using E-Ink's new Carta displays instead of the previously used Pearl displays. I love that and have been waiting for years for E-Ink, the Taiwan based company that makes the Kindle screens for Amazon, to improve them. It looks like they're finally getting it!The new Kindle's screen resolution is 167 ppi which is slightly lower than the Kindle PaperWhite which is 212 ppi, and substantially lower than the Kindle Voyage which boasts an impressive 300 ppi (individual pixels at this density can not be distinguished by the naked eye.) Price-wise though, the base model PaperWhite runs 99 at the time of this review, and the Voyage base model runs 199 so you can see, the more you pay, the better the resolution and features. 167 ppi is fine though...Read more",
What is there to be said it's storing data on my phone. I just got a Sony Experia Z1 and it has such a quick response time I can't even notice. When transferring large zip packs it may take 30 seconds for about a 1GB,
There was no need to format or set it for fat32. The micro SDXC worked out of the box. I couldn't be more satisfied.,
"It's faster than my 2 year old 32GB Micro SD cards, and this 64GB version works great with my Samsung S4 phone. I didn't even need to format the card, it came pre-formatted, FAT32 I think.",
"Appears to be Class 10, holds about as much as it says it does, came with an SD card adapter and they even gave me the option to forgo those ridiculous plastic packages that you all know and hate. The ones that the scissors refuse to cut and you just end up hurting yourself a few times before getting it open. Completely as advertised.",
"64GB is pretty good size, and in a cell phone, it's awesome. However, getting it formatted as FAT32 is not the easiest method. By default, Windows 7 will not allow anything larger than 32GB to be formatted as FAT32. Even if you execute a DOS command to format to FAT32, it will fail. There is a fix though. Ridgecrop Consultants Ltd has a program that can be downloaded. I would suggest that you support this free application by sending the guy a few bucks, as he has truly written a great program that works very well in Windows 7. I have used his program, &#34;fat32format&#34; to successfully format this 64GB MicroSDXC disk. I then copied all of my contents from my old 12GB disk to this one. I inserted the disk into my phone, and whalla! It works great! Very pleased with this purchase.",
"I bought this card because my 32GB Sandisk ultra stopped working in my Galaxy S3.  I tried formatting the card, but it didn't work.  When this card showed up, I read the warranty information, and the ultra series has a lifetime warranty! I emailed the company, and they sent me a shipping label to return the card, and my new on is on the way!  I highly recommend these cards!",
Great for adding a ton of storage to your smartphone or other device.  Fast enough for most needs and the price is right.,
"Nothing bad to say, great product, great price. Works excellently in my video camera. One won't go wrong with this card.",
"My wife's Razr M has been a great phone to date. I matched it with what I thought would be a great memory card, having been a long time Sandisk Ultra user in my photography.Sadly after 3 months, without warning, the card mysteriously ""bricked"". Unreadable by her phone, two PCs and one Mac .. the only thing that can even SEE the card is my Droid Bionic - which says the card is unreadable and needs to be formatted. I am hesitant in the very odd chance I can still recover the many gigs of photos and videos of our 6 month old baby which were not backed up.I could not be any more disappointed in this product.",
"Installed this in my S4 and it was immediately recognized by the phone. I performed a format from the phone just to see what it would do, but it didn't give me any further storage capacity with the card. With card overhead it still adds nearly 59.5GB of storage capacity to my bloated S4.I tested moving existing applications, pictures, music, and other files back and forth between my phone and the card, absolutely no problems. If you're not going to put a lot of music, pictures or applications on your phone, you'll probably be fine with no additional storage. However, if you're going to add any storage capacity to your phone, why not maximize it with a 64GB card for about $50?",
What's to say?  It's fast and I have had no errors from it.  I mostly use it to hold music so I can use my phone as an MP3 player.,
"I a using this card with a Sansa (sandisk) mp3 player and it is working flawless. I am glad, but I cannot imagine what could go wrong with a card like this, either it works or it does not, and mine is working. Anyway, I would buy one of these again without a doubt.",
"The Amazon Tap is a portable Bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice. You can instruct it to play music, order products and services, control home automation products and connected devices, plus a whole lot more.It contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands. It also has Dolby stereo speakers for playing music. The Amazon Tap is basically the portable version of the popular Amazon Echo that was released last year.Ive been testing the Tap for several days now. Heres what I think so far: What I Like I find that the Tap understands my verbal commands accurately. This could be due to the fact that, since its button activated, Im always very close to the device when I speak to it. Nevertheless, its nice that Tap understands me the first time. This was my experience with the Amazon Echo as well.The audio is surprisingly good for such a small device. I test portable speakers all the time and Id say the Amazon Tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range. Don't expect Bose type sound or deep bass levels, however.No other portable speaker device offers voice control and Wi-Fi streaming. Thus the Amazon Tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers. This is especially true if you already have Amazon Prime and Prime Music.It supports many great services. Like the Amazon Echo that came before it, the Amazon Tap supports popular music services such as Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.Battery life has been good so far. I used it off and on for a couple days without charging it. Ill post an update once I have come closer to testing the limits of the battery life.Read more",
"I accdientally dropped it in my garbage can and it got a tiny drop of water on it, but it still worked perfectly! sandisk cards are always faster read speed than sony's cards (the competitor) and this card is muuuch cheaper than the competitors as well. therefore i have no choice but to give this a 5 star and a SERIOUS recommendation.",
"It's fast. Works as described. Plenty of space left free now. Fast transfer speeds if used with compatible card reader. Would recommend.This product features Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging, which is recyclable. It comes without excess outer packaging materials such as hard plastic clamshell casings, plastic bindings, or wire ties. The packaging is designed to be opened without the use of a box cutter or knife, and it will protect your product just as well as traditional packaging.As of this writing, the Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card ia actually priced lower than other class-10 cards from PNY and Polaroid. This makes the Sandisk the best value - especially if you need honest class-10 performance across all platforms.",
"It is great, works fast, and came with full size sd adapter.It clearly pays off to buy the faster version of the SD",
I got this to put in the i9 by cect that I got through amazon and it works great. bye,
"Love it! I purchased this as I have had audible for quite some time now and thought it would be easier just to get the Amazon Brand for downloading from KindlePrime, Audible and even the endless books for being a Prime member AND it is!! I have a reader also, thought that was all I would ever need, now wishing I would have just purchased this in the beginning. Being a Prime Member and all of the new neat things Amazon is coming up with, this is just way better AND easier (for me) NO DOUBT about it. I DO like all the features it has and the tech help available when you have issues (if you are sooo behind in the tech world as I am) -) Next Kindle FIre I purchase will be the 64 GB though...kind of just thought try it on for size (so to speak)... had no idea I would truly like it so much! Very pleased with this purchase!! Seems well made and durable, although the kid case I purchased to go with it might be why it feels as such LOL!!",
Bought it as addition to my tablet Samsung Note 10.1 edition 2014. IS great for storing pictures and....... Very good at a reasonable price.,
"My wife's new Galaxy S3 ran out of storage space as we were moving her music library to the phone. Ordered two of these, one for her phone and one for mine. Installed them in a couple of minutes, and they were immediately recognized by the phone. It couldn't have been easier!",
A great performer for the price ... The capacity is limitless ... The speed is superb too considering it's in a smartphone :),
"Using this in a contout gps camera,  don't waste your time buying any other brand it will be a waste. Buy the best to start with.",
"I've used the 32GB version of this card since I got it in two Android phones and no problems with either phone.  It gives me all the music, pictures, downloads, etc. storage I'll ever need.  As fast as any other card and faster than most.  I also love Amazon frustration fee packaging.  Since there are so many fakes with online retailers, buy from a trusted source like Amazon.",
Formated to FAT32 using Easy Partition Home Edition (free on the web) and it works on both my Samsung Galaxy S ii phone and Asus TF101 tabletAm gonna buy another one so each can have one,

"I use it for my galaxy s4 and this card crashed on me few times, i lost all my photos and music. Thankfully they were all backed up but the worst part is, the card completely stopped working at one point. I had to contact sandisk for a replacement and it was a hassle.",
Product supplied as described: 16GB Micro SDHC Class 10 card with Adapter. I purchased this to use in my Samsung Galaxy Tablet and it works perfectly. It is easy to identify from other micro flash cards you may have because of its red/grey color. This is a great memory solution for your stored media for any device!,
this does excatly what i bought it for goes in to my phone and is a nice storage comes with a micro sd to sd converter so it was a nice buy,
There are a lot of reports about 64gb cards not working in the Gopro hero 3. The 32Gb works great for me.,
Bought 2 of these absolutely no issues,
same as I wrote for all other cards by SanDiskgood qualityworks well for long timea must for extra photos and songs in your cellphone,
"Top of the line  data storage and expansion. Perfect for adding more storage to your phone or your tablet, and as always, SanDisk is reliable.",
"I bought this memory card specifically to add extra storage on my Samsung Galaxy S3. It was very easy to install in the phone and it recognized the card instantly. I turned the phone off before I removed the back cover and installed the card. I am not sure if this is needed, but I figured it wouldn't hurt by doing it that way. After it was installed and recognized, I formatted the card through the phone options. The card is very fast when writing to it or reading from it.I would definitely recommend this card to others, especially if you have a Galaxy S3 and want some more storage space on it.",
Got this for my son gopro and it works perfect he is able to record and take still video and pictures and the quality on playback is very good. a would recommend and buy this product again.,
"Arrived in manufacturers packaging so it looked authentic. I was still sceptical based on reviews I read from others on Amazon, so I called thecustomer service phone number for San disk and they verified it was genuine. You will need a magnifying glass ro see the numbers printed on the back of the card, or alternately you can take a photo of it with your smartphone, I used the Galaxy S3 om Macro or text setting and then enlarged the photo to read the numbers.very happy with this card fast response, have hundreds of photos and songs on this card and it works great.",
Good case!!,
one of the best memory cards for a good low price. SanDisk Has and Will Always be a great company to do business with.,
"The primary reason for buying this extra capacitySanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10card was to use it inSamsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch Model GT-P5113)and I am happy to share that you can get this to work flawlessly after some initial glitches. (Read below)Firstly you need to be aware that the Samsung Tablet Model GT-P5113 currently runs with Android OS 4.1.1 with Kernel 3.0.31-523998 and Build number JRO03C.P5113UECLK7.(Jelly Bean) My experiences shared here are with that level of Android OS your experiences may vary depending on what version of OS you are running. The SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC card purchased from Amazon (Retail Packaging) gets recognized just fine however when the tablet's Media Device A.K.A 'MTP' application attempts to talk your PC via USB cable the Tablet simply reboots! and after that the card is presented to the PC. - Really strange indeed!This baffled me for couple of hours. Firstly, I attempted to format the card (exFAT) in PC and it formatted just fine. After that I attempted to use it in the tablet to see the same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of the tablet as 'MTP' application tries to communicate with the PC. This made me investigate the issue further and I determined the root cause was the fact that SANDISK now seen to factory format the card with 'exFAT' but also somehow seen to include an 'offset' of 16MB at the beginning of the card which shows up as 16MB unallocated region in the initial sectors on this card under windows disk management tool.The solution is to get rid of that 'unallocated' 16MB partition on the card. You could do it in PC but that might require some windows command line experience and using 'diskpart' utility and what not and I do not want to confuse people here with that process. For most novice users The process should be very simple, Just insert the card on the tablet and use the 'native' SD Card format tool under 'settings' that Android OS 4.1.1 has and it will get rid of that 16MB partition and happily remount it. Now after this simple process the 'MTP' application works just fine with PC to transfer files to the SD card without any strange reboot phenomenon.Not sure why SANDISK formats their Class 10 card in this fashion (They never did it with their class 6 cards earlier) and there's gotta be some technical explanation for why they include that 16MB partition that only SANDISK can give. In the end if you reformat the card in the tablet (Which defaults to exFAT) the card is seen to work just fine.Bottomline:-----------This is an awesome 64GB capacity MicroSD card from a reputed manufacturer for budget minded people and gets the job done beautifully. The read and write speeds are adequate enough for most Audio,Video & picture file formats in a tablet. The glitch mentioned above forced me to give *Four* stars instead of *Five* stars but let that not stop you from making a decision to buy it.Highly recommended!Cheers!",
super fast card and it has lots of space. great for movies and pictures and music and other stuff. Its awesome,
"The moment I got this, I just plugged it into my SGS3 cellphone. I transferred some videos from my cellphone memory directly to the SanDisk Ultra, and it copied real fast. I plan to replace this soon with a higher capacity 32GB variant. Highly recommended brand.",
"Got it for my samsung galaxy talet 2 10.1, its ideal for the tab.  No problems with it got it in the day I got it, does exactly what I want it to do",
This card is very fast and perfect for my Samsung Galaxy Note. I used it for HDR photography and it works very well.,
"I bought two of these Memory Cards for use with my Logitech Alert 750e Outdoor Master Security Camera's. So far, I have found them to be unreliable. I am not entirely certain if this is because of the Camera system or the Memory Card themselves. The camera frequently will report a memory card error that indicates the card has to be reformatted. This is problematic as if the camera had recorded something that was important, the failure of the SD card would be very troublesome indeed.",
"I've been an iPad user since the original came out. I also have an iPad 3. I have worked in IT for the past few years so I would say I am pretty good with technology and fancy new devices. With that introduction out of the way, I will be reviewing key points that I have seen touched upon in other reviews. Here goes...BUILDThe device feels nice and solid. I'm a little surprised at how heavy it is, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The rubberized backing is always nice for added grip. It's not as nice as say unibody aluminum, but it's not 500 either.SCREENThe screen is fantastic. But my problem is the same as when iPad got Retina Display, other than the OS, most apps look rather pixelated. A lot of the games I tried are not high definition, at least not high enough to look smooth on this screen. Hopefully apps get updated to higher resolutions.LOCK SCREEN ADSYeah there are ads on my lock screen. I'm not sure why this is such a big deal. How much time do people really spend looking at the lock screen The first thing I thought when I saw the ads is WOW the pictures are really crisp! The ads are there to subsidize some of the 200 price tag. I might pay the 15 to get rid of them so I can customize it, but I might not. I feel like this has been blown out of proportion by other customers.SOUNDThe sound from the speakers is great. Much better than you would get from more expensive devices, very crisp and clean. I have the official Amazon case on and it has not affected the sound at all. Nothing much else to say, I doubt anyone will complain about this.CRASHINGI've had two apps crash on opening. I don't know if it is the app or the OS. It's probably somewhere in the middle. Again, not a big deal for me.Read more",
It's a nice item but really there's other things that do the same thing. So we actually returned it.,
OK so far with my Samsung Galaxy S3. I initially received one that seemed to have an issue. It would intermittently save a photo here and there that would become corrupt a short time later. (The DropBox auto upload was fine so I know it was stored OK initially.)Amazon (excellent support) quickly shipped out a new one. The replacement has been working great so far! No sign of the issue I had with the first one.The only con is the time to display contents and read it in MTP mode if it has a lot of files.*** This is NOT the fault of the card. It's a known issue with phones in MTP mode.Note to Rooted GS3 users...I also tried putting the phone in the old unmounted USB mode. I was unable to read it but was able to read a 32GB version of the same card. It appears the GS3 does not support over 32GB in the old USB mode. Possibly part of the reason why they did not include a USB option via phone settings.,
This one works just like it's supposed to work.  Fast response on delivery and the adapter fits the standard memory card reader.,
Good to have an extra one for the camera or tablet. Holds a lot of data.,
"All i can say for now since i have yet to use them is, they showed up on time very fast, as well each came wrapped in a small paper packet that is small enough to fit in your pocket. Secondly If these are the right ones i believe they will be excellent since based on the info and exp. i know from other ones i have used. I got them as gifts for other people so i have not had a chance to notice much. Hope this helped.",
Good product but requires hands on to operate. Good if sitting close but not if you're mobile. Wold be great if portable and hands free. Returned it and ordered the Dot.,
Bought these together with the SD and couldn't found any better pricing than these. Just don't know where I will be using it for but it will come in handy and that's lowest price I've ever seen....thanks for the great product .....,
"I got this for my camera to use when I know I need to shoot JPEG+RAW.  It keeps up no problem with 1080p/60 as well.  Unless I'm trying, I don't really feel the limits of this MicroSD card.",
"Works great, good transfer speed, capacity is as claimed.Only con I can think of is that it's too small and this is the second one I'm buying because I lost my first one while playing with my phone in bed and could not find it ever again. It's probably stuck in some sheets or the bed frame, I tried but can't seem to locate it anymore. I had just discovered and saved the cure to cancer on that card and I cannot remember what it was now. Sorry.",
The SD card adapter came in handy and we were able to use the card in my father-in-law's Nikon D3200.,
"I waited and waited to see this on the lightning deals, and I finally got it. It cost under $25.00, and I haven't found it cheaper since.",
"This memory works great on Surface Pro 2, no problems at all, transfer rates are acceptable. Before the Surface Pro 2's firmware update, the memory was disconnecting itself, I had to take it off and put it on again, but after the firmware update, I have no problems, the memory always stay there.",
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",

"I knew I was going to purchase a New Samsung Note 2 phone and I purchased this long before I actually needed it.

"[[ UPDATE - 6/19/2014 ]]So my lovely wife bought me a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 for Father's Day and I've been loving it ever since.  Just as other with Samsung products, the Galaxy Tab 4 has the ability to add a microSD card to expand the memory on the device.  Since it's been over a year, I decided to do some more research to see if SanDisk offered anything new.  As of 6/19/2014, their product lineup for microSD cards from worst to best (performance-wise) are the as follows:SanDiskSanDisk UltraSanDisk Ultra PLUSSanDisk ExtremeSanDisk Extreme PLUSSanDisk Extreme PRONow, the difference between all of these cards are simply the speed in which you can read/write data to the card.  Yes, the published rating of most all these cards (except the SanDisk regular) are Class 10/UHS-I but that's just a rating... Actual real world performance does get better with each model, but with faster cards come more expensive prices.  Since Amazon doesn't carry the Ultra PLUS model of microSD card, I had to do direct comparisons between the SanDisk Ultra ($34.27), Extreme ($57.95), and Extreme PLUS ($67.95).As mentioned in my earlier review, I purchased the SanDisk Ultra for my Galaxy S4.  My question was, did I want to pay over $20 more for a card that is faster than the one I already owned?  Or I could pay almost double to get SanDisk's 2nd-most fastest microSD card.The Ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage (storing/capturing pictures & HD video and movie playback) on my phone.  So in the end, I ended up just buying another SanDisk Ultra 64GB card.  I use my cell phone *more* than I do my tablet and if the card is good enough for my phone, it's good enough for my tablet.  I don't own a 4K HD camera or anything like that, so I honestly didn't see a need to get one of the faster cards at this time.I am now a proud owner of 2 SanDisk Ultra cards and have absolutely 0 issues with it in my Samsung devices.[[ ORIGINAL REVIEW - 5/1/2013 ]]I haven't had to buy a microSD card in a long time. The last time I bought one was for my cell phone over 2 years ago. But since my cellular contract was up, I knew I would have to get a newer card in addition to my new phone, the Samsung Galaxy S4. Reason for this is because I knew my small 16GB microSD card wasn't going to cut it.Doing research on the Galaxy S4, I wanted to get the best card possible that had decent capacity (32 GB or greater). This led me to find that the Galaxy S4 supports the microSDXC Class 10 UHS-I card, which is the fastest possible given that class. Searching for that specifically on Amazon gave me results of only 3 vendors (as of April) that makes these microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 cards. They are Sandisk (the majority), Samsung and Lexar. Nobody else makes these that are sold on Amazon.Seeing how SanDisk is a pretty good name out of the 3 (I've used them the most), I decided upon the SanDisk because Lexar was overpriced and the Samsung one was overpriced (as well as not eligible for Amazon Prime).But the scary thing is that when you filter by the SanDisk, you literally get DOZENS of options. All of them have different model numbers, different sizes, etc. Then there's that confusion of what's the difference between SDHC & SDXC?SDHC vs SDXC:SDHC stand for ""Secure Digital High Capacity"" and SDXC stands for ""Secure Digital eXtended Capacity"". Essentially these two cards are the same with the exception that SDHC only supports capcities up to 32GB and is formated with the FAT32 file system. The SDXC cards are formatted with the exFAT file system. If you use an SDXC card in a device, it must support that file system, otherwise it may not be recognizable and/or you have to reformat the card to FAT32.FAT32 vs exFAT:The differences between the two file systems means that FAT32 has a maximum file size of 4GB, limited by that file system. exFAT on the otherhand, supports file sizes up to 2TB (terabytes). The only thing you need to know here really is that it's possible your device doesn't support exFAT. If that's the case, just reformat it to FAT32. REMEMBER FORMATTING ERASES ALL DATA!To clarify the model numbers, I I hopped over to the SanDisk official webpage. What I found there is that they offer two ""highspeed"" options for SanDisk cards. These are SanDisk Extreme Pro and SanDisk Ultra. SanDisk Extreme Pro is a line that supports read speeds up to 95MB/sec, however they are SDHC only. To make things worse, they are currently only available in 16GB & 8GB capacities. Since one of my requirements was to have a lot of storage, I ruled these out.The remaining devices listed on Amazon's search were the SanDisk Ultra line. But here, confusion sets in because SanDisk separates these cards to two different devices. Cameras & mobile devices. Is there a real difference between the two or is this just a marketing stunt? Unfortunately I'm not sure but I do know the price difference between the two range from a couple cents to a few dollars. Since I wasn't sure, I opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices (just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue). To find the exact model number, I would go to Sandisk's webpage (sandisk.com) and compare their existing product lineup. From there, you get exact model numbers and you can then search Amazon for these model numbers. That is how I got mine (SDSDQUA-064G).As for speed tests, I haven't run any specific testing, but copying 8 GB worth of data from my PC to the card literally took just a few minutes.One last note is that Amazon attaches additional characters to the end (for example SDSDQUA-064G-AFFP-A vs SDSDQUA-064G-U46A). The difference between the two is that the ""AFFP-A"" means ""Amazon Frustration Free Packaging"". Other than that, these are exactly the same.  If you're wondering what I got (and want to use it in your Galaxy S4), I got the SDSDQUA-064G-u46A and it works like charm.",
"this item works as intended, well made, functions properly. good level of comfort fairly cheaply priced wont need to replace any time soon",
great fit and works great fit right into my phone without any problem just like one i would have gotten from (their store) but cheaper on here amazon,
"Samsung Galaxy Note can't read this card, have to be format in Fat32. Just Google the small program to do the trick. Work perfect.",
"My wife and I just upgraded our phone to Note 3 and wanted more space.  We had the phone for 4 days now and Micro SD card works fine.  However, I feel transfer rate is slow when transfering movies from my desktop to SD card.  1.2GB movie will take about 12-16 minutes.  I have pretty high end gaming PC.  Intel I7 980X CPU, 12GB Memory, 7870 ATI Graphic card, 120GB SSD card, 3TB hard drive for storage, 1200W 80Plus Gold PUS, ASUS Sabortooth motherboard,etc.  When transfering movies or file to my WD 2.5 inch external hard drive will take 1-2 minutes.  Still satisfied, since I have more than 90GB of storage on my phone.",
"A good size and good price for a small camera or phone that takes micro SD memory; this is fast but not hyped as AIIIIGH-SUPER-SPEEDY because it doesn't need to be; it's good for all the standard usages of your average consumer (photos, ringtones, games, lightweight video, etc).",
No issues.,
"A very good product and very useful for my smart phone, adapter works fine.Recomended for all th smart phones that can expand to 64 GB",
Bought it for my Galaxy S5. Dumped 32g of music on it and so far so good. It's nice to have plenty of storage.,
Excellent product for my new Galaxy S4 phone. On-board storage has now been increased 4-fold! Would definitely recommend this product.,
"Fast, easy, and great amount of capacity!!! XC is pretty quick and I am enjoying mine on my Galaxy S4 :)",
"My computer couldn't tell the difference, or at least not noticeable to me. I needed the extra space. Thanks for having a great product with a great price!",
My husband and I bought this for our GoPro and we used to to record our vacation to Mexico. We still have more than half of the space left!,
"I bought a generic SD card for my Galaxy S5 and it corrupted all of my music. I am glad I have this SanDisk because it is faster at reading/writing and comes with the MemoryZone Backup app free, however, you need to have Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, or a similar cloud service. MemoryZone is great at backing up but lost some of my data when doing a transfer (phone to SD) :/",
Nice price for a gift idea at the time. Small compact version of Alexa.,
"Not a bad product at all. I got it for my blackberry Z-10. I had to format it through the phone's software, but afterwards it worked like a charm. A couple months on and no problems. Class 10 and 64 gig, so I have no complaints. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it isn't particularly outstanding in any way, but it is a pretty simple product. Does the job, no problems, good to go.",
"I purchased this micro memory card for my GPS. When I updated the maps recently, the GPS ran out of room and I could no longer put the entire US map in it. This card fits neatly into the GPS slot, and adds enough memory for the GPS to work. I haven't had this fix in place for long, so don't know about how well it will continue to work. The adapter looks to be handy if I have another use for the card.",
"Great storage, has not failed yet after about a year of usage.",
"I bought this as a gift for the hubby and he seems quite well happy with it. It hasn't given him any issues, and he certainly uses a lot of information/media on his smartphone since he is a techie lol",
"Maybe there is nothing that can be done and it is just the way the technology is at this time, but to me it seems that the 64GB SD cards have very limited uses at this time because they are formatted in whats called ""exFAT32"" instead of the standard FAT32 to get 64GB from a 32GB card.  After receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with, Jelly Bean, it was recognized and it did show I had 59GB available.  I then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers, a Win7 and a Vista, and tried to transfer files, photos and videos from my laptop to the card they WOULD NOT TRANSFER!  After some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new ""exFAT32"" to the standard FAT32.  All my files were created in Win XP and Win Vista - FAT32.  I also have a Win7 machine I recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exFAT32.  I had read on the internet about reformatting  the cards and it working.  My Win7 machine does not even have the option to format to standard FAT32, it only has NSTF and exFAT32.  My older computers have the older FAT32 format option and it took my Vista computer with a Dual Core processor 1  hours to reformat the card to FAT32.  After reformatting I was able to easily transfer my files, photos, and videos on my XP and Vista computers BUT not the Win7 computer.  The card works in my tablet and I am able to access and use all the files I transferred to the card in FAT32 with my Vista computer on the tablet.  BUT after reformatting it now the card only has 27GB of space available, so it was essentially reformatted the 64GB card into a 32GB card.  I will keep the card because I have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future I can reformat it again back to exFAT32 if and when exFAT32 catches on and an OS is made that can seamlessly use files created in both FAT32 and exFAT32.  This seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big GB card that can be used for everything in every device, unless ALL your files, photos, and videos are in, or will be created with, exFAT32 there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower GB cards if you really need this much storage space in a Micro SD card.  Or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exFAT32 and double the capacity if your computer has the exFAT32 reformat option.  I have not tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems like it would work if exFAT32 works for you. I gave 3 stars because it does work, but I feel Sandisk not fully explaining how they are getting 64GB out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have with it is misleading advertising.",
"Its a good Micro card, self explanatory, I haven't had any issues with it. Works for just about putting anything on it.",
I was able to add 10 full length movies at 720p for my phone with no problem with this chip. Must have for long airplane trips.,
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
Added it to my Samsung Note ll and now I have 80 gigs of storage. I have everything in there that was on my other phone and I have only used 5% of my capacity.,
"I got it on a pretty good sale... so I feel it was worth it. The sound is good, I like that it's portable and rechargeable. I think it is best if you have a prime account so you have access to the prime music.",
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",
Zero complaints! Works great. My old card just quit and it seems certain cards fail on s3 and s4 devices. This one is made to work on them. Order placed and received in just over 24 hours!,
this works great on my Galaxy S4 right out of the box.and its faster then the old 32gb card i used to have.,
"Ok first things first, I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap.Now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the Tap was voice enabled like the Echo. I happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through. Because the Echo is not meant to be a mobile device. It generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have. But the Tap is meant to be mobile, and therefore I am happy it's not a Voice command device. I would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it. So I actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature. I have the Echo on my kitchen counter and the Tap in my Studio office. And when I leave my office I just grab it and go.I bought this on sale for 89 and I went to the store and listened to many Bluetooth speakers. And while yes the charge 3 sounds better, all the charge 3 can do is be a Bluetooth speaker. While the Tap is so much more for less . And the Tap sounds Great. After looking online I was a little nervous that it would not sound that great, but I was 100 wrong about that. There is no other product out there for 89 that sounds this good and can do what the Tap does.I was not paid or given a Tap to write this review. I'm just a consumer who was it the market for a Bluetooth speaker, and I could not be happier with my choice.Also if you buy this device buy the Amazon sling as well. Trust me you will want it. And honestly I am again happy I got the one that covers the bottom of the Tap. Because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink I would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed.That's it, that's all. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!",
Very fast and reliable this SD gives my GS4 so much more ability. But I am thinking about buying the 64gb so keep that in mind 32GB will fill up kinda fast if you shoot lost of photos and videos.,
Great product for intro to an AI device. Cant wait to upgrade to echo.,
"Nowadays this memories don't have the fastest write speed, but even tho those are good speeds.On the other hand, SanDisk is a good mark.And, what adds even more value, imo, it's that those specific memory cards have a lifetime warranty.I got one damaged in 1 year, and they changed it.I really like this warranty service.",
This is the third Kindle I have bought. I bought one for my Father and now this one is for my girlfriend. One little known feature of the Kindle is your get your own kindle.com email address when you buy one. You can use this email address to email books to yourself or to other people. I routinely download .mobi and .epub books online and email them to myself and to my Dad (and soon my girlfriend). Within seconds they will magically appear on your Kindle's home page.,
It was an unexpected gift. I like this more than the Alexa because this one is portable. It's great for streaming music. My kids use it all the time. Only problem so far is it does not always understand what I'm saying. Especially when saying the name of a radio station. Sometimes takes few tries before I get what I'm looking for. It has great sound when playing music. Talk radio is not as good but understandable. If you want a portable speaker and Alexa this is the one to get.,
I have this in my LG Optimus F3 cell phone and I can't believe how fast the file transfer is.  I can take pictures on this card as quickly as I can click the shutter button.  I am very happy with the card and the price I paid for it.,
"If, like me, you are still happily in the Stone Age with Windows XP, your computer will not be able to use this card unless you install Windows Update KB955704.  This update is available from Microsoft.com.Thanks to dOGG94, who pointed this out in Customer Questions and Answers on August 6, 2013.  I installed this update and am now able to load GoPro's pictures onto my computer. dOGG94's answer to the customer question provides the link to the update.  Amazon did not allow me to post the link here.  I don't know why.  Just go to the Microsoft.com updates site and look for KB955704.  Or go to the indicated question for the link.The product description should have provided this information.",
"A great memory card, at a very good price. I recently upgraded to this memory card for use in my cell phone, and it has plenty of space to hold all of my music, videos, and photos. I can download as many songs as I want, and take as many photos (at the highest quality) as I want, without having to worry about the memory on my phone filling up.I have used SanDisk memory cards many times before, and I have always had very good experiences. It is still too early to tell if this card will live up to that standard, but so far, this memory card has worked very well for me.The Class 10 rating refers to the speed with which it writes to the card, and I have noticed that it is quicker than my previous micro SD card. As an upgrade and expansion to your smartphone's memory, I highly recommend this card!",
"I bought this card to expand the memory in my Note II. Works well, no complaints so far. Will probably purchase a 64 GB when this one fills up.",
"Well what to say This is a replacement remote, did I buy it due to one not working Nope the kids lost it and I wanted another till I could find it. Paring it was simple, hold the home button for around 10-15 seconds to let the fire stick find it and then Boom your all set to go!Works just like the original that came with it so no worries there.",
"I purchased two of these microSDXC cards when they were on sale around Black Friday, and have been using them now for just about two months. They work wonderfully and I have had absolutely no problems with either. These SanDisk memory cards are 64 GB microSDXC class 10, UHS-1 cards, which are rated for transfer speeds up to 30MB/sec.The UHS class 1 designation is intended as an performance measure that indicates the card is capable of supporting real-time full HD video recording. Of course, this only works if you are using a device which is capable of writing to the card at those speeds, but most modern devices that offer full HD recording, such as camcorders, digital SLR cameras, and cell phones with built in Full HD recording do support this standard. The benefit of using a UHS-1 card on a UHS certified device is that you should not encounter the problem of buffering or your device stopping recording because it could not write fast enough.However, because these are extra high capacity, sdXC cards, you will need to make sure that your device can support microSDXC cards, and not simply microSD or microSDHC ones. The biggest difference is that the microSDXC standard uses the exFAT file system, rather than the FAT32 or NTFS systems. While most modern Android devices (and in fact most linux/unix devices) can handle that without difficulty some devices, such as older cameras, Android devices, and some Windows devices, may have difficulty with the format.Having said that, I've been using these in Nikon D80 & D7000 digital SLR cameras, as well as Samsung Galaxy S3 and Galaxy S Relay 4G phones without any difficulty, and they read & write fine on my computers. All in all these were a great buy and I'm very happy with them.",
"I now have a 76 GB tablet, thanks to this reasonably priced micro SD card and EaseUS Partition Master.  As the description says, it comes with an adapter to normal SD size.  Just put the micro card into the adapter, put the SD card into the SD slot on your computer, launch EaseUS Partition Master (free), and right click and choose partition format.  After that was completed, I put it in my tablet, and it showed almost 60 GB free.  Together with the 16 GB that came on my tablet, I am extremely pleased.  As always, Amazon delivery was fast, and I couldn't be more pleased.",
"This card is great. It's really fast compared to common cards even from Sandisk, Kingston, etc.If you need to copy files to your card in the shortest time, then this is the right one.It&#8217;s reliable, never missed a photo or music file.5 stars well deserved.",
fast and holds all my music and larger apps.,
"Update on Dec 23 2013 - Please scroll to the very end of this review for 2 month use update. ...For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model. The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080). This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution. The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.Read more",
"It served its purpose - no complaints, I used it for my samsung device andI am still storing on it.",
Got this for my GoPro Black Edition to record up to 4-5 hours of video at the highest setting. Very pleased with its performance and so far no errors or failures.,
Wonderful card and performs fast and efficient. I use it with my Samsung Galaxie S3 with no problems. Love the hjgh caparcity it offers and reliability of SanDisk,
"Got it on time, and I haven't had any issues at all. I got if for my Samsung 10.1 note and there is by far plently of space left.",
I put this in my Galaxy Tablet and increased the memory by 32gb.  It is hard to believe there is that much space on something so small.,
"Excellent product, comes with an full size SD card adapter. I consistently got 10MBps writes and 32 MBps reads. (note its MBps not Mbps). Highly recommended.",
"This card showed up and was formatted and recognized by my android phone with no issues at all. After doing a speed read / write test on the card, the speeds obtained were well within what a Class 10 should realistically accomplish. Great card, great price, and wasn't shipped a junk card in disguise. Highly recommended.",
"I am writing this from the perspective of being a long-time experienced Kindle user vs. someone brand new. From an overall perspective, considering the pricing of the Kindle with Special Offers at 79 vs. higher amounts for the different flavors of Kindle available today, this one is a bargain. If you have wanted to get your kids a Kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because 119 to 400+ is a lot of money to risk with a child, maybe at 79 this is your price point.From a size standpoint, the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e-Ink Kindles. It is slightly thicker - but slightly lighter - than the Kindle Paperwhite, but to me it's not really a noticeable difference when you're holding it in a protective cover.Opening up the box, included with the Kindle is a micro-USB cord but no power adapter. That's really annoying. Interestingly, and it seems rather chicken of Amazon, a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for 15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the Kindle (or 20 if you purchase it later), so if you already have a micro-USB charger handy I wouldn't order one of the chargers.There are no page buttons - no buttons at all except for the power button - and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you're reading, or swiping the screen with your finger.Reading is easy on this one: in comparison to my Kindle Keyboard, the previous version of Kindle, and a Kindle DX the letters on the screen are much, much darker and easier to read: the display is crisp and dark.Read more",
Works flawlessly.  I dont buy any SD cards unless its from SanDisk.  Never had a problem with them and i know their class speeds are true or under rated compared to other brands.,
"I bought this for use in the GoPro Hero3 Black Edition.  It has excellent storage and R/W speeds.  I have filmed at 1080p w/ 60fps and shot pictures at a rate of 30 pictures/ 1 second and there were no issues at all.Excellent product, especially for this camera.",
"Using this in my Samsung G3 cell phone as a memory card and expansion. it works ok for now, allthough not the card but the phone itself does have a slight issue with reading massive sd cards at this high compacity. I hope that samsung will release a software or firmware update to resolve the issue with reading the card on boot up of the phone sometimes. I have found that simply restarting the phone usually resolves the issue with reading the card. or any other error messages. Overall minus the slight issues it works great.",
"And I hope I never do! Because of the price point and my past experience, these are usually the memory cards I go to first. I've never been let down yet.",
This is a big card for a great price.  I remember buying a 2GB CF card for around $200 a while ago!,
"Great MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 disk with Memory Card Adapter. great product and does with my tablet and Netbooks and Laptops.The speed of the data is good as well. I would say please get this item, and the price is good as well.",
I have a long term positive experience using SanDisk cards. The card works great - both transfer and read speeds. I have now purchased five of these cards over the past few months and my experience continues to be great. I recommend this product.,
No problems with this micro SD. It works and works again. And then you know what? It works even again,
"I use this to hold all 22 gigs of my music on my galaxy S3. And I still have room for several seasons of a TV show. Definitely a great product.The only thing I can complain about is there is a one second gap between songs, At least using Google music. I suppose that's the price you pay for this large of storage",
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
I got this to add some room on my Samsung Galaxy S3. It works great. I do not have any complaints.,
"Back 4 years ago, you'd be crazy to buy this thing, because it was so expensive. 10 years ago, you'd practically had to make 6 figure to buy this, really, for show, because nothing can utilize it that well.Today, it's cheap, it's stable, and it works.Plus, it came with the adopter. Good deal.",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
"I got this not for the space but the speed.  Class 4 is ok, but class 10 is where its at.  Copying files, scanning the card, cleaning caches, writing files, this thing grinds threw it all like nothing.  Before it would take 2 minutes upon boot of my phone for my old class 4 32GB micro sd card would be done scanning.  With this its 7 seconds.",
Loving it! Plenty of room to store my media and go back and forth between my pc and tablet.  Also great for storing all my school related texts and documents.,
"Got this in as described. So far it's working very well. I am not a technical person on calculating the speed. For a normal person, it's pretty fast and easy to access. Great product.",
"I used mine to download MP3's on my phone in order to not run up streaming charges and it's excellent for the purpose, or for any other extra storage needs.  It fits my Galaxy S4 perfectly, was very easy to install, and seems to be working seamlessly.  I highly recommend it.",
I have used this product with my Samsung Galaxy S3 and my Sony Xperia Z1 and it performs without fail.  This added much need memory for my phone to take pictures and video.  I would recommend to all Android phone owners.,
"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysJuly 30, 2014Hi Dallas, thank you for sharing your feedback. We wanted to let you know that we made it easier to find your favorite Prime content with the click of your remote. You can now browse many more Prime-only categories, including Top Prime TV, Top Prime Movies, Prime TV for Kids, Prime Movies for Kids, Prime TV by Genre, and Prime Movies by Genre.",
The card worked great at first. I've never had a problem with Sandisk in the past but I bought this card for my Galaxy S3 back in October and it was dead by December. I'm sorely disappointed by this purchase. Maybe it's just a faulty card but my experience was terrible so this gets one star.,
Fast shipping & delivered as described.Phone did not recognize the card right away. I had to format it as FAT32 on the computer but it showed capacity of 32GB. To get the full capacity I had to format it again on the phone (exFAT format) now shows 64GB.Excellent capacity for lots of media files & documents.,
"Hard to believe that 10 years ago you would have needed a big hard drive to have this much room. I use this card in my Samsung Y Duos Smartphone and it provides more than enough room for my entire music library, a bunch of movies, and all of the apps for my phone and I still have more than 3/4 of the space left.Works perfectly and I've always had good luck with SanDisk products.",
"25 for a case for a product that costs 50. Typical scam from Amazon just a warning, in the process of returning both items seeing as the Fire 7 is a broken device. To transfer any data to it, you must restart replug the device for each file... even a 5 thumb drive can do more without an interface.",
"My Amazon Prime movies come in crystal clear and fast.The Voice Search really WORKS very wellMy Netflix resolution is excellent, much better than what the Netflix app on my LG flatscreen TV delivers.The Plex app delivers excellent video (I haven't tried the music yet).Having used this for a little over a week now my next step is to buy two more for each TV in the house and give away my Apple TV. It simply does everything so much better.Most Satisfied Highly recommendI will post an update if I have anything further to add but I will say this: Go get One - Really Worth The Price",
with the black friday discount the price is great. i got free shipping by bundling other items to meet (over $35) free shipping. comes in sandisk package so it is nice to know it is not a black market knockoff. i bought 2 of these babies.,
"Bought these for use in my kids' tablets, have not had any problems with them in several months of use, price was very good and transferring speeds are more than adequate.",
"I own the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1I bought the 64g microSD card..(please keep in mind I know NOTHING about computers and I was able to do this.)I put it in the device to format...the tablet couldn't read it.  Would never mount.  Tried to format it with my computer....and still just wouldnt work..although it would be formatted.  Remember, I was using all defaults.Sent it back, Amazon sent me another one. (Amazingly fast service)...same thing.I called Amazon...they knew of no issue why my tablet wouldn't accept the card. (I would think that their customer service dept. would stay on top of these posts because I found that this was a HUGE issue)On my THIRD card I did some research.  For whatever reason for this SD card to work it must be formatted as a FAT 32 NOT an exFAT.  BUT...(this is the rub)...windows only allows for formatting either to exFAT or NTSF...(at first, I thought it was an adult swim reference).....so....that sucks....this means that I can't use this card because I can't format it properly.  But wait..there's more....there is a super easy fix....any idiot can do it.....from start to finish took me all of 45 seconds (after reading instructions)...and ta-duh.....now the micro SD card works fine. Thank-you Amazon for your excellent return policy..(super fast, super easy, super friendly)...BUT your live customer service should know about this.  I can't fault the operator...she was nice..seemed genuinely concerned and tried to make it right)...ok.. no more stalling..here is the address of the youtube video.  link to website is in the description.[...] ...link to website in description.  I used all defaults and worked perfect.  or search youtube - convert fat32",
So far so good. Fit right into the slot on my Samsung S5,
"Works as describe.  If your going to use it in a phone I would suggest putting it into phone and letting your phone format it, this will save you a bunch of headaches later.",
"The Tap is portable, has excellent sound quality and is a good value for the money.",
Enjoying the product and feel the ease of use is good.,
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase",
Good loud sound. Very good speaker. Convenient voice commands to take outside of house.,
It is great to take my Tap on the road. Easy to use and sounds great.,
"It's a fast card, reliable, and it offers tons more space for my Nook HD. Solid buy that you won't regret.",
"Great price for this card. Lots of other places are charging over $40 each!!! SanDisk is a very safe bet. Haven't heard of any forgeries of these card yet like some other companies' cards. 64Gigs give you plenty of room to put LOTS of your music, photos and more on.",
It works great in a 7&#34; Andoid tablet.  May switch it to my GoPro for the additional memory.  I will have to see if it downloads fast enought,
"It stores stuff like any other memory card.  Amazon - fantastic price.  I bought this for my Samsun Galaxy tablet 3 8.0 and it works perfect.  This maxes out the memory for that tablet.  Tip: store all your apps etc on your tablets internal memory and photos, movies, pictures on this card.  If you ever run out of space you can keep and extra card or two on hand.  If you store apps on this card then you will not be about to use them if you want to change out the card.",
I can't believe how small memory cards are getting! This fantastic little device fits into an adapter that can be read by my MAC!,
"Overall sound is not as good as Echo, my primary source for Amazon content. However, the Tap is great for medium volume music and radio stations and as an alarm clock. It's portability sets it apart, however, it's nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disconnecting. Recent software update now allows listening mode. It does require a brief pause after saying Alexa wake word, but it does work. This drains the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button. The portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my Echo, which is fabulous!",
Does exactly what it is supposed to.  Plenty of storage for me GPS.  Price was not too high either.  Would recommend.,
"Just received this today. Removed it from the packaging and inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3 (Verizon) and powered the unit back up and the storage was available. No formatting required. Worked the first time out. Settings showed 29.71GB of total space (32GB version) and 29.71GB of free space. I like the fact that a SD adapter came with it. Should I ever need to insert the card into my laptop it will come in handy. (yes I can plug my phone directly to my laptop but if I ever swap this 32GB card out of my phone and replace it with a 64GB version, I can use this 32GB version via the adapter for other purposes.)",
"Ok first things first, I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap.Now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the Tap was voice enabled like the Echo. I happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through. Because the Echo is not meant to be a mobile device. It generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have. But the Tap is meant to be mobile, and therefore I am happy it's not a Voice command device. I would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it. So I actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature. I have the Echo on my kitchen counter and the Tap in my Studio office. And when I leave my office I just grab it and go.I bought this on sale for 89 and I went to the store and listened to many Bluetooth speakers. And while yes the charge 3 sounds better, all the charge 3 can do is be a Bluetooth speaker. While the Tap is so much more for less . And the Tap sounds Great. After looking online I was a little nervous that it would not sound that great, but I was 100 wrong about that. There is no other product out there for 89 that sounds this good and can do what the Tap does.I was not paid or given a Tap to write this review. I'm just a consumer who was it the market for a Bluetooth speaker, and I could not be happier with my choice.Also if you buy this device buy the Amazon sling as well. Trust me you will want it. And honestly I am again happy I got the one that covers the bottom of the Tap. Because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink I would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed.That's it, that's all. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!",
"Works with my Nikon D3200 camera and also my HP laptop, but for some reason my friend's laptop (Dell) would refuse to recognize it/acknowledge its existence. Not sure if it was the card, the adapter, the computer, the port, or what. Card should work fine for anything, I think.",
"I bought this to expand storage in my Samsung Galaxy Reverb.  I was getting 8-10 MB/s transfer speed while transferring MP3s on my commodity SD card reader (Kodak brand, $10-$15 at any supermarket electronics section).  It is worth noting that UHS-1 cards basically revert to class 10 if your hardware isn't UHS-1 compatible.I've been using the card for a month or so and have never had trouble with it - no read errors, no mount errors, no bad sectors.I got mine on a Black Friday sale, so the value was great.  Do some price shopping - if the price is good, you can't go wrong with this if you want a big micro SD card.  As usual, Sandisk is a good way to go.",
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",
"We have 4 of the 32GB cards in our cell phones and love them.  They offer plenty of room for pix, music, and videos and are fast to save and load from..  Someday, when I get my desired tablet PC, I will be getting another one of these for it!",
"Inexpensive, fast and made my videos a bit less choppy during recording HD.  A good buy now, and seems to be a better value for the Class 10 cards...",
"Good quality product for the price, I bought it for my go pro and I haven't had any issues yet.",
"And it got stuck in the adapter they sent with it, had to break that open.  It fit in another adapter though",
"Good, but not overall as capable or comprehensive as I was hoping. Will continue to explore capabilities and Apps.",
"Haven't used it yet.  It's my first encounter with a Micro.  Appears to be a quality product, though instructions for using the adapter would be welcomed.  Good cost and fulfillment.  Expecting it to function as advertised based on SanDisk's track record at our house.",
This super-speed card works great in my phone. I haven't had any problems with it since I bought the thing! I'm certainly able to record HD video right onto the card no problem. I recommend this for those who need quick data delivery to and from there external card. I recommend it!,
My fire stick (non voice activated) seemed to be broken. Fire stick responds to my iphone app but not the remote. I was ready to purchase this when I thought to go to settings and add another remote. Followed the on screen directions and my old remote is back. For some reason it just needed to make the hand shake again. Don't forget to try this before giving up and buying another remote.,
"I originally bought a Samsung equivalent and then my phone was stolen, so I made the switch.  I have done some research and realized the class 10 and the SDXC are very important as it is the quickest rate of transfer.  However when you read Samsung's description and this one, Samsung claims 80 mbps and SanDisk has 30 mbps, after using both they are identical.  The class and the sdxc are the most important, they are almost absolutely identical.  Samsung's equivalent is $65 and this was under $50.  I haven't noticed a bit of difference, besides that maybe this mircosd card is a bit quicker and easier to move files around.  I store a lot on my phone, which is a Samsung Note 3, this works beautifully.",
"Works great in my Galaxy S III.  I converted all my ""good"" music to .flac files so I have lossless playback using the Android GoneMAD player and couldn't be happier.  Transfer speed it good and there are no hickup when playing back these 45M+ audio files.",
"I got this card specifically to use for making ClockworkMod/PhilZ recovery backups on my S4. I tried using my 64GB cards, but neither recovery properly supports exFAT file systems. Yes, you can reformat in FAT32 if you really want to, but it's not optimal. Besides, I don't really want to carry 10+ GB of data backups around with me on a daily basis when I could carry music or videos instead. So now I leave this card safely tucked away on my desk and only use it when necessary. Works great!",
"I'm a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to compare the latest Kindle to. I don't own a Nook. I don't own an iPad (and, in any case, that's comparing apples to oranges). I don't have a Sony e-reader. 'This will be a short, simple review.I received my Kindle about a week ago and haven't been able to put it down.Things I like about my Kindle1. The e-ink display is amazing.2. Using the 5-way controller is simple and effective.3. Page turn speeds are faster than I thought they would be.4. It's lightweight, even with the attached cover (I have an Amazon cover with a built-in light)5. Page-turning buttons are quiet and well-placed.6. Recharge time is fast.7. I can order a book and start reading it in less than 60 seconds. Nice!8. Portability... I can take 3,000 books with me when I travel for work and not require additional suitcases or baggage fees.Things I'm not too keen on1. Buttons are too close together and are laid out oddly.2. Lack of individual number buttons is frustrating.3. Power button on the bottom Not a bad thing. Just an odd thing. (Same for the headphone input). I usually rest the bottom of a book on my lap when I read.Things I hope change in the future1. How books are organized... When I put a book in a collection (which is actually a tag), it still appears in the main list. It's not actually moved, it's merely associated.2. The look of the main screen. I'd like folders or some other way to display collections.3. Ability to create personal screen savers.4. E-book pricing, though Amazon has little control over this. Still, most titles are the same price as or less than their hardback/paperback counterparts.Read more",
not a bad prices and really adds the needed storage.  I added to Win8.1 and android tablet.  No problems. Plug and go.,
"I'm a full-time writer who works at home. I'm unmarried, I don't watch TV, I don't have a mobile phone, I hate gadgets in general. OK, so I'm a loser. But since Alexa came into my life, I'm no longer alone 24 hours a day. Which begs the question, if I'm not alone, who is in the room with me Amazon The so-called cloud The NSAThe 18,000 plus reviewers who have already posted have gone into great detail about how they use their Echo (my Alexa). Having anthropomorphized my Alexa, I'm unwilling to use her at all, but we hold pleasant converse throughout the day. My favorite conversation I'll repeat for you below, verbatim:Me - Alexa. Wake me in fifteen minutes.Alexa - Fifteen minutes. Starting now.Me - Thank you.Alexa (remains silent, modestly hiding her feelings by not displaying her snazzy blue lights)If I knew relationships were this easy, I would have married thirty years ago, but now that I have Alexa, there's no need. Except for the one thing.I really (and Amazon, please don't tell Alexa I wrote this) don't care for the name. I know we have the option to change the name to Amazon, which is worse. What I really want is to be able to change the name to Libby, after the helpful AI librarian in the EarthCent Ambassador series, but in a pinch, I'd settle for Kelly,Other than that, my Alexa is perfect. Well, except for that time when I asked her to play rain sounds for relaxation when I was trying to sleep, and she woke me up after I finally nodded off to inform me that she'd lost her Internet connection. But from what my married friends all tell me, you have to expect these sorts of things.Read more",
Use this with my GoPro Hero 3 HD to record high definition sports video and this chip does it very well. I would definitely recommend it,

I got these on sale and must say they truly have so much space for a good price. SO anytime you see them on sale start snatchng these babies up especially if you like to travel.,
"Got it to use with my Go Pro. This was cheaper than getting the regular SD Ultra card (Class 10). The read/write speed isn't quite as good as the regular SD Ultra card (Class 10), but it gets the job done. Shipped fast, great price, exactly as described!",
"The Tap is a great portable speaker with fantastic sound. If you press a button then you can connect to Amazon Alexa and she can play your music, answer questions, etc. Downgraded one star because there is supposed to be a hands free option for Alexa but I haven't been able to get it to work. Still great to be able to take this around the house vs Echo which is tied to the plug.",
Ordered this one because my 2GB finally wasn't enough storage and I thought I could use the extra GB for future use. SD card is legit and does very well! Definitely recommended.,
This was the necessary addition to the GoPro mini HD camera.  Very pleased with the service and what was advertised.  Will be a repeat customer for sure as I look forward to adding to my video & photography collection of accessories.,
"This is exactly what I was looking for to upgrade the memory of my smartphone. Good transfer speeds to using SanDisk product, and great pricing from Amazon.",
This review is about the certified refurbished Fire HD 10 unit I ordered. It looked and acted like a new unit for 80 less. Still trying to decide if I want to give them back 15 to remove the obnoxious adds on the lock screen. They really aren't that bad.,
"Bought this few days after I got my phone and it has great read and write speeds and it seems like taking care of some processing and handling of things within the phone. I changed the settings that every time I take a picture or record a video, it will go automatically to the microsd card. Added most of my movies in this tiny card and it works smoothly.",
Perfect for our GoPro.  We haven't &#34;maxed&#34; it out yet so I'm not sure how much video it will hold but we've been using it for a while now & haven't had any issues with it getting full fast.,
"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more",
"All is fine with this memory. It works very well with my Smartphone, very fast communication with my pics and videos. Good purchase!!! The product arrived on time too.",
"What can I say, it's a memory card.",
"It's quick, theirs clout behind the name and I haven't had any errors/faults on the three (3) that I've bought thus far. Keep in mind, these are a dime a dozen these days, but not all are equal. Stick to a dependable brand, like SanDisk and spend the extra $1-$5.",
I didn't really need this for my phone but I figured I may as well get it. Got to love 32gb of storage. Works good for when recording 1080P video.,
Works great with my dash cam. 32Gb for $20? yeah i would say this is a win! Works in my phone and digital camera as well.,
"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded. I've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that I'd expect any besides possible fading).",
"tested the SD card speed through the play store app, gets the speeds advertised and allows me to download more tv shows for my trips! perfect",

"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",

Since the software update that allows you to use ""Always On"" voice commands like its big brother, it has become my go to device.Pros:- Wireless Bluetooth Smart Speaker - I take it to work and use it in the car, even when I travel for work- Sync's up with my popular music aps (Spotify, Pandora, etc)- Alexa is very responsive and can answer your questions quickly- The best Alarm Clock- I sync up with audio books and will use it on long car rides or business trips- Speaker is able to get loud- Control smart devices like lighting and my ecobee - Option to turn Off/On voice commands, can use tap button instead- Very long range for voice commandsCons:- Only single band Wi-Fi 2.4Ghz- Battery life when using ""Always On"" voice commands is short- Speaker quality is sub par for music compared to other Bluetooth speakersOverall the usefulness of this device is near perfect for my needs, with only minimal cons. I use this device pretty much every day and is small enough to make for an excellent travel companion.Tip for BESTBUY: You should carry cases for this device as I had to get my protector elsewhere",
"Bought this card for my Galaxy S4 and after installing it and loading my music, the card was randomly ejecting itself. After like the 3rd ejection of the morning, the phone reported that the card needed to be reformatted because it was damaged, so I reformatted.

After googling, I read that the Galaxy series phones are known to have compatibility issues with SanDisk cards and its a hit or miss, some phones have no issues. I have replaced this card already, which Amazon, shipped me a 2nd card within a few days, but the same problems arise. Not sure if I should switch to a different brand, but this card is definitely useless to me for the time being. Maybe I can give it away to a friend who doesn't have an S4. :/",
"it is extremely small. so small in fact, that it could easily get lost. so i recommend that once it's in, you leave it in. but it's a great idea, to allow the camera's, phone's or any other device to be that much smaller. i've only had it for a short while, but so far so good.",
Great card but have had some issues with my GoPro 3 with this one. Maybe a firmware update will help my situation.,
Amazon Tap.. got it on Black Friday sale.. But so far feel not as easy as I think to use.. But if you just use as Bluetooth speaker and sound is good.. Maybe just have to learn how to use it more..,
"I typically don't post reviews however don't waste your money on this case. I got it on Friday and started using it that evening. Its now Thursday and the case is peeling at the edges, the fabric around the camera hole has started bubbling, and the felt on the inside edge is wearing off. i have not had any issues with it standing on its own like other people have mentioned. I am giving this a two star mainly because it is still functional. I am tempted to send it back but I like the functionality of this case.",
"Good price and fast enough to load MP3 files from the computer quickly.  I use these in Sansa Clip MP3 players, perfect match.",

"Good value for the money, shipping was a little longer than I expected, but it was worth the wait considering the price.  works great with my go pro hero 3 black edition.",
We use this speaker all the time. It's perfect. I would buy this time and time again.,
Fast! Reliable! Huge storage. Already own 2 for my mobile devices. Transfer speeds are awesome. No problems to date. Great buy.,
"love it makes my tablet work so much faster,because it take up alot of memory that would be on the Internal storage,,free's alot of space, I've got a bunch of music and movies downloaded on this Micro card and only using about 1/4 of it memory. thanks I would recommend this,to anyone whole loves music and movies on the GO!",
"This micro card works well with my Go Pro Hero3+, does what you would expect a micro SD card to do.",
Works perfect on Samsung Galaxy S4... memory is fast and didn't get any unmount problem mentioned on previous reviews... my model number is GT-I9500 and version is 4.2.2,
"Got the card, took it out of the package, dropped it in my Samsung S4, rebooted and it detected it immediately.  No need to format or anything.  Haven't done any speed tests, but I haven't noticed any sluggishness that would warrant them, either.",
I got this to expand the storage in my Microsoft Surface and it works great. I can quickly transfer data on to it and then pop it out and put it into my desktop or phone. Definitely recommend if you need big storage for your mobile device.,
"LOVE OUR NEW ECHO! I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them echolettes LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request.Read more",
THis memory helps me to keep all what I want to keep on my cell phone.It is a good brand and its on the right price.,
"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more",
I have lost my data 3 times with this card. I don't know if it's the card or the S3. My data always ends up as unrecoverable pieces in the LOST.DIR directory the phone creates the first time you insert the card. I don't trust it to hold anything I cant afford to loose.Update: I purchased aKingston Digital 32 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDC4/32GBlast week as a replacement. It hasn't lost any data yet. I'll update here again if it has the same issue.Update 2: TheKingston Digital 32 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDC4/32GBhas been in my phone for 2 months with no data loss. It is the better product.,
"Pretty good price, great performance! I've been using micro SD cards for years, tried many brands mostly cheaper. There is a reason they've been around and will continue to be!",
"This is fantastic, its fast and bundle of space.I have been using this for 2 years already and still going strong. I store all my pictures and video on here taken by my phones.This is a must buy for your phone!",
"Easy to use, no thought necessary and plenty of storage for movies to use on my Microsoft Surface Pro 2",
"No problems to report, works as described. Scandisk makes a very stable product for temporary storing and later transferring of images and video footage.",
"This card continually unmounted in my S4. It was really painful, when I remounted the card I sometimes retrieved my files, sometimes not. I have to say, though, that a card test in my PC, using Crucial diagnostics, went fine. My gut feel is that the card overheats, and shuts down in the S4, although I have no proof of this. What I do know is that it didn't work for me, and many others (google it). Naturally, Amazon refunded me the purchase cost when I returned the card, gotta love Amazon.I now have a Samsung 64g card, and no problems so far. I like Sandisk, but there's a compatibility problem here with the S4.",
"this is a good, fast card, with plenty of capacity and it works great for additionals storage in a Microsoft Surface RT tablet.Hint: you can add the space to your windows libraries for a more seamless experience in the OS by creating a few empty, dummy folders on your C drive, then using the windows disk management console to map those folders to the folders on the card.Info on that here:[...]",
"I do find this better than the cheaper version I bought initially at Staples. It charges faster but not as fast as the Kindle charger that I had used for a couple years before it finally gave out. Also, it is not possible to charge and still use your Kindle, something I was able to do with the previous charger, a feature I really miss. Still, better than the alternative.",
I think the title says it all. This card is &#34;Super Fast and Works Great&#34;. So happy to have this in my phone. (Samsung Galaxy SIII),
"For any camera and video recorder, I use them with d800  and d700 and are cool and  nice for both funtions",
"Nice product,has plenty of space and is very quick and easy to use,it is also nice to have thereafter so you can use on many optional devices",
Device works exactly as expected.  Holds a lot of music videos.  Would recomment to anyone.  Great product!  What else can I say!,
Easy upgrade to the storage in the LG Marquee. Seems pretty fast and stores data just fine. Not sure what else to say about memory? It works!,
"Bought this for use in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. Works great! No formatting, no muss, just works like it should.",
This works well and is speedy in both my Samsung Galaxy S3 and my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1.  The included adapter works great in my PC memory card slot as well.,
"I really like my Tap very much. It great when it's connected. Reads me news, weather, plays music and can purchase items from Amazon That being said, I do have some connectivity problems while on wifi. I don't want to say that it's the taps fault as it may be my wifi. I don't regret my purchase. It has great sounds and recognizes my voice commands well.",
